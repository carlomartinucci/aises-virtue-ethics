The case study "Sacking Social Media in College Sports" examines the ethical considerations surrounding the use of social media by college athletes and the measures taken by coaches and universities to regulate this usage.

In June 2011, Steve Spurrier, head football coach at the University of South Carolina, banned his players from using Twitter. This decision was influenced by an incident where a former player falsely tweeted that Alshon Jeffery, a star wide receiver, had been arrested after a bar fight. Although the claim was untrue, Spurrier had to manage the ensuing media fallout. He stated, "I donâ€™t see how it could do any good for anybody," and advised players to let others handle tweeting.

Other instances of problematic social media use by college athletes include:

- Texas lineman Buck Burnette posted a derogatory Facebook message after Barack Obama's 2008 election victory, leading to his dismissal from the team.

- Florida football player Will Hill shared vulgar tweets about drugs, sex, and dissatisfaction with university-provided meals, later claiming his account was hacked.

- North Carolina defensive lineman Marven Austin posted pictures of a luxury vacation in Miami, prompting an NCAA investigation into players receiving illegal benefits from agents.

- Four female soccer players at San Diego State were penalized for posting alcohol-related pictures on Facebook. ([mediaengagement.org](https://mediaengagement.org/research/sacking-social-media-in-college-sports/?utm_source=openai))

In response, several college coaches have restricted or banned social media use among their players. Boise State football coach Chris Petersen was the first to implement such a ban, followed by coaches at Kansas, Pitt, Mississippi State, and Villanova. Some programs adopt more moderate approaches, such as requiring athletes to set accounts to private or including clauses about honor and dignity in internet postings within student-athlete handbooks. Others monitor athletes' social media accounts using software like UDiligence, which alerts administrators to specific keywords in posts. UDiligence founder Kevin Long describes the software as a tool to "provide a teaching moment, a mentoring moment to the student."

Despite these restrictions, some coaches find social media beneficial for recruiting purposes. Santa Clara men's basketball coach Kerry Keating noted, "It's another vehicle to exchange information... Recruiting is all about communication and it's another good communication device." Fox Sports columnist Bill Reiter added, "Twitter is nothing more than a modern means of talking." However, concerns persist that some players may be "talking too much." ([mediaengagement.org](https://mediaengagement.org/research/sacking-social-media-in-college-sports/?utm_source=openai))

This case study highlights the tension between the benefits and risks of social media use by college athletes, prompting discussions on the appropriate balance between freedom of expression and the responsibilities associated with representing a university athletic program.
