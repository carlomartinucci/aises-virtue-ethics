American football is a rough and dangerous game. It features high-speed collisions between human beings, at least one of whom is often very large. Broken bones, torn ligaments, and even occasional paralysis can result. But it is the research on brain injuries that has caused many people to claim football is immoral and to advocate that it be banned. Such calls have gained the attention and opposition of the National Football League (NFL) given the high popularity and profitability of football as a spectator sport.

The Center for Disease Control defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as “a disruption in the normal function of the brain that can be caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head, or penetrating head injury.” A concussion is a form of TBI where the blow causes the brain to move rapidly back and forth, bouncing around in the skull and suffering various types of structural damage. Although concussions can carry serious consequences, they are termed a “mild” form of TBI because they are not typically life-threatening. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), says the Mayo Clinic, is “brain degeneration likely caused by repeated head traumas.” Repetitive head impacts (RHIs) can cumulatively lead to CTE and early death, even though no single RHI results in a concussion.

If only one thing is clear about the current science surrounding sports-related concussions (SRCs) and their related brain injuries, it’s that very little is certain about the current science. The field is surprisingly new. A significant scientific breakthrough occurred in 2002 when an African-American neuropathologist in Pittsburgh named Bennet Omalu (played by Will Smith in the 2015 movie Concussion) performed an autopsy on Hall of Fame center Mike Webster. Dr. Omalu identified abnormal clumps of the protein tau in Webster’s brain, which he believed to be evidence of CTE. Such proteins develop in tangles that slowly strangle neurons and, consequently, inhibit brain function.

Many studies point to how dangerous football is to players’ long-term brain health. Although there is also research related to college players and younger, this case study focuses on the NFL. The studies show:

- Over two regular seasons (2012-2014), NFL players sustained 4,384 injuries, including 301 concussions. This statistic is up 61% from 2002-2007, perhaps reflecting an improvement of awareness and reporting (Lawrence et al. 2015).

- In a study of 14,000 NFL players, researchers found that even head impacts insufficient to cause concussions can mount up over the years, leading to CTE and premature death. An NFL player who plays 24 games increases the likelihood of premature death by 16% (Ehrlich et al., 2019).

- A 2019 study of the brains of 223 football players with CTE and 43 players without CTE found that for each additional 2.6 years of play, the risk of developing CTE doubled (Mex et al. 2019).

Given the results of these studies, there has been a strong outcry against football, including at the NFL level. The NFL initially pushed back against the implications of such research. Then, as evidence piled up, the NFL funded research itself about head injuries and also how to design safer equipment. And, the NFL made rule changes in an attempt to make the game safer. The NFL has also changed rules to discourage helmet-to-helmet contact, and instituted protocols for safely returning concussed players to the field.

Despite these changes, controversy continues because the science in this area is not settled. Importantly, standard medical imaging techniques do not show brain damage even when a player has had a concussion. And CTE cannot truly be diagnosed until the brain is examined after death.

Neuropsychologist Munro Cullum argues: “I worry the pendulum has swung too far. The reality is that we still don’t know who is most likely to suffer a concussion, who will take longer to recover, how anatomic or genetic differences influence concussions, and who may be at risk of prolonged symptoms or developing cognitive problems later in life.”

Some studies seem to indicate that concussions may be more benign than feared. For example:

- A 2016 study found no elevated risk of suicide in a population of players with at least five years in the league (Lehman et al., 2016).

- Another study of 35 former NFL players over age 50 who had sustained multiple concussions during their careers found no significant association between the length of careers, the number of concussions, and their level of cognitive function later in life (Mez et al., 2019).

- A 2007 study found that retired NFL players experienced levels of depressive symptoms no worse than those of the general population (Schwenk, 2007).

So, at the end of the day, the jury still seems to be out on the question of whether or not we can go to a football game or watch one on television and still feel good about ourselves for supporting a sport that arguably causes irreversible traumatic brain injuries.
