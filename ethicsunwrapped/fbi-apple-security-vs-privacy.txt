In December 2015, the FBI obtained the iPhone of one of the shooters involved in an ISIS-inspired terrorist attack that resulted in 14 fatalities in San Bernardino, California. During the investigation, the FBI attempted to access the data stored on the device but was unable to bypass its encryption. The Obama administration's legal team approached Apple for assistance in unlocking the phone; however, negotiations soon reached an impasse. Subsequently, the Justice Department secured a court order compelling Apple to aid the FBI in unlocking the device. Apple's CEO, Timothy Cook, publicly contested the court's directive in an open letter, igniting a vigorous debate over the balance between national security and individual privacy.

Apple, along with supporters including major technology companies like Google and Facebook, argued that the court order posed a threat to individual privacy on multiple fronts. Firstly, Apple contended that the order effectively mandated the company to write code, thereby violating its First Amendment right to free speech by compelling it to "say" something against its will. Previous legal cases had already established computer code as a form of protected speech. Secondly, Apple expressed concern that creating such a backdoor could potentially fall into the wrong hands, jeopardizing the privacy of all iPhone users. Lastly, Apple warned that complying with the order would set a dangerous precedent, enabling law enforcement to repeatedly require businesses like Apple to assist in criminal investigations, effectively turning technology companies into agents of the government.

On the other hand, representatives from both sides of the political spectrum presented several arguments in favor of the Justice Department's position and against Apple's stance. Their primary assertion was that the U.S. legal system establishes constraints on the government's access to private information, preventing abuse of search and surveillance powers. Simultaneously, the law permits authorities to access information that facilitates the prevention and prosecution of criminal activities, ranging from terrorism to drug trafficking to child exploitation. Critics of Apple also dismissed the slippery slope argument, asserting that if Apple cooperated, it could safeguard the code it created and prevent it from falling into the hands of malicious actors, including terrorists or criminal organizations. Moreover, Apple faced accusations of prioritizing its brand image over national security and was even labeled unpatriotic for refusing to comply with the court order.

Ultimately, the FBI withdrew the case after successfully accessing the iPhone's data without Apple's assistance.
