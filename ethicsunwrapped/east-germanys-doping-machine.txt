After World War II, Germany was divided into East and West. East Germany (the German Democratic Republic—GDR) became part of the Eastern Bloc under the USSR's influence, while West Germany aligned with the U.S. and Western Europe. Facing economic struggles and mass defections to the West, the GDR built the Berlin Wall to prevent its citizens from leaving.

In the 1960s, the GDR government aimed to showcase the superiority of its communist system through athletic success. A secret law mandated the use of performance-enhancing drugs in athletes' training. Coaches and doctors implemented a systematic doping program, recruiting young athletes and administering anabolic steroids, notably Oral-Turinabol, often presented as "vitamins." Athletes were required to take these pills and forbidden from discussing them.

While some young athletes may have initially believed they were taking vitamins, most eventually realized they were using performance-enhancing drugs. Male athletes experienced increased muscle mass and stamina, while female athletes saw even more pronounced effects.

Between 1968 and the late 1980s, approximately 9,000 GDR athletes were doped, leading to significant successes in international competitions, especially the Olympics. In the 1968 Olympics, the GDR women's swim team won 11 of 13 gold medals, raising suspicions. The U.S. women's team managed to win only one gold medal, notably in the 4×100-meter relay, where they upset the favored East Germans.

Many GDR athletes were aware of the illegal doping and had misgivings but generally complied with their coaches and doctors. One swimmer recalled:

> "The training motto at the pool was, 'You eat the pills, or you die.' It was forbidden to refuse."

Some athletes resisted. One female swimmer, who gained 45 pounds of muscle, recounted:

> "I just woke one day and said this feels like sh*t. It’s wrong, it’s cheating, and I feel horrible. When I said no, no more pills, no more needles, the coaches freaked out. They kept trying to convince me to dope, but I refused. Shortly afterward, my performances fell behind my other training partners, so they moved me into the lazy group. I was no longer a member of the GDR elite. There was fighting and arguing and it got ugly, so in 1979, right before [the] Moscow [Olympics], I just quit. Hung up my suit.

> I knew we were on something. Everybody was getting enormous, and we are talking about young women, teenagers, here; so we all knew that we were being doped, but we were forbidden to talk to anyone or to each other. It was like prison. I got called before the Central Committee, the big STASI [the GDR’s secret police force] honchos; they wanted me to take the vitamins and keep swimming; but I told them forget it, it was wrong and dangerous. They thought I was nuts, so they cut me loose. I also believe that some of the young girls loved the way their swim times dropped and their recovery from hard workouts, so they didn’t complain; they rather enjoyed it."

By the late 1980s, Olympic doping authorities began uncovering the GDR's practices. Doctors and coaches, aware of the adverse effects of Oral-Turinabol, continued the doping regimen. Men experienced shrinking genitalia; women developed enlarged clitorises, excessive body hair, deepened voices, and increased aggression. Both genders suffered from severe acne, liver damage, heart disease, various cancers, infertility, and birth defects in offspring. One doctor later expressed regret:

> "I can only repeat my profound regret. I was far too obedient. We were pressured into producing for the political leadership. We had to create international champions for the glory of the communist sporting machine."
