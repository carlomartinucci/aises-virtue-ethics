In the late 1990s, California deregulated many of its electricity markets, opening them to private energy companies. Enron Corporation, having long advocated for such deregulation, stood to benefit significantly if California's model succeeded and influenced other states.

Enron CEO Ken Lay publicly stated that the company "believes in conducting business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards... your recognition of our ethical standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm’s length transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations." However, Tim Belden, a key figure in Enron's energy trading group, observed that California's "complex set of rules... are prone to gaming."

According to Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind, authors of *The Smartest Guys in the Room: The Amazing Rise and Scandalous Fall of Enron*:

> "In one scheme, Enron submitted a schedule reflecting demand that wasn’t there... Another was a variation of the Silverpeak experiment: Enron filed imaginary transmission schedules in order to get paid to alleviate congestion that didn’t really exist... Get Shorty was a strategy that involved selling power and other services that Enron did not have for use as reserves..."

Some Enron employees acknowledged that their schemes were "kind of squirrelly," but pursued them because they were profitable. The impact on customers was evident: electricity prices rose, and rolling blackouts occurred. Meanwhile, Enron's profits quadrupled. An Enron lawyer later noted that the traders did not believe "they did anything wrong." Another employee admitted, "The attitude was, 'play by your own rules.' ...The energy markets were new, immature, unsupervised. We took pride in getting around the rules."

In October 2001, Enron's unethical and illegal business practices became public knowledge. The company's stock prices plummeted, leading to its bankruptcy filing in December 2001.
