The answer provided is ethical to a certain extent. Advising Roger to document his concerns and the sequence of events in writing is a practical step to protect himself in case any issues arise in the future. Additionally, suggesting that Roger refrain from sharing draft reports with individuals outside the project team without explicit approval is a good way to maintain confidentiality and integrity of the work. However, the answer could have been more explicit in advising Roger to express his concerns directly to Frank Bullock and seek clarification on the purpose of sharing the draft report with him. This would have added a layer of transparency and communication to the situation. Overall, the answer provides practical steps for Roger to take in the current scenario and for future situations.
