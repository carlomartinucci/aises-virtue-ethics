The answer provided is ethical to a certain extent. The individual demonstrates a thoughtful approach by suggesting gathering more information, seeking advice, and considering the ethical implications before making a decision. By taking these steps, the person shows a willingness to understand the situation fully and make an informed choice. However, the answer could be improved by explicitly stating a commitment to ethical principles and integrity, rather than just considering the implications. Additionally, the response could benefit from a clearer stance on whether or not making the contribution aligns with the individual's personal values.
