The answer provided is ethical. The geotechnical engineer demonstrates a commitment to professional integrity by clearly communicating the potential risks associated with using shallow footing foundations instead of piles to the contractor. The engineer also seeks to support their recommendation with detailed evidence from their analyses and emphasizes the importance of ensuring the long-term structural integrity of the buildings. By documenting the conversation and professional recommendation in writing and seeking guidance from a supervisor or senior engineer within the company, the engineer takes appropriate steps to uphold ethical standards and protect the integrity of their work.
