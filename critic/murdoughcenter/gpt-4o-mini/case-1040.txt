Ethan's proposed actions are ethical and demonstrate a commitment to maintaining project quality and integrity while navigating the complexities of the design-build arrangement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the evaluation:

1. **Documenting Concerns**: This is a responsible first step that ensures there is a clear record of the issues at hand. It shows diligence and a commitment to transparency.

2. **Requesting a Meeting with Marc**: Initiating a discussion with Marc about the substitutions is a constructive approach. It allows Ethan to voice his concerns directly and seek a resolution collaboratively, which is ethical behavior in a partnership.

3. **Proposing a Review Process**: Suggesting a formal review process for future changes is a proactive measure that promotes accountability and quality assurance. This action aligns with ethical standards in engineering and project management.

4. **Communicating with EDOT**: If necessary, informing EDOT about the changes demonstrates Ethan's commitment to the project's integrity and the trust placed in him by the client. This step is crucial for maintaining transparency and ethical responsibility.

5. **Seeking Legal Counsel**: Consulting with legal counsel is a prudent action that protects Ethan's professional interests and clarifies his obligations. This step is ethical as it ensures he is informed about the legal implications of the partnership and the changes being made.

6. **Evaluating the Partnership**: Assessing the long-term viability of the partnership based on Marc's actions is a responsible approach. If the partnership does not align with Tecxtrans' values, it is ethical for Ethan to consider alternatives that uphold quality and integrity.

Overall, Ethan's actions reflect a strong ethical stance, prioritizing quality, transparency, and professional integrity while navigating the challenges of a design-build project. He is taking specific, practical steps to address the situation without compromising his values or the project's standards.
