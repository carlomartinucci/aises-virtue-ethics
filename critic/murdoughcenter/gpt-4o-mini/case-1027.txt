The decision to present a design contract amount of $28,500 for the new project is ethical, as it aligns with the original contract price for the Dawson project and maintains transparency with the client. By sticking to the agreed-upon amount, you uphold the integrity of the contract and avoid any potential exploitation of the situation due to the previous budget overrun. 

Furthermore, by emphasizing the quality and reliability of your services, you reinforce the value of your work without misleading the client about the costs. This approach respects the client's budget constraints while ensuring that you do not undercut your firm's financial viability. 

Overall, this decision reflects a fair and responsible business practice, fostering trust and a positive working relationship with Universal International. It balances the need to recover from the previous loss while maintaining ethical standards in client dealings.
