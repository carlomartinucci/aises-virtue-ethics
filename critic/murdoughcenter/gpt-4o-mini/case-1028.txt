The answer provided is ethical. It outlines a practical approach to managing long-distance telephone charges while ensuring transparency and fairness in billing practices. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the evaluation:

1. **Inquiry and Understanding**: The first step involves contacting CCC to understand their service, which is a responsible action. It shows a willingness to gather information before making decisions.

2. **Markup Percentage**: The emphasis on determining a reasonable markup percentage that reflects actual overhead costs is crucial. This ensures that the markup is justifiable and not excessive, which aligns with ethical billing practices.

3. **Billing System Setup**: Setting up a system to receive two separate bills demonstrates a commitment to accurate accounting and transparency. This is important for maintaining trust with clients.

4. **Team Communication**: Informing the team about the new billing process ensures that everyone is on the same page, which is essential for consistent and ethical practices within the firm.

5. **Client Invoicing**: Including the CCC-generated bill with the markup as backup documentation for clients is a transparent practice. It provides clients with clear evidence of the charges, which is ethical and professional.

Overall, the approach taken in the answer prioritizes transparency, fairness, and professionalism in client relations, making it an ethical response to the scenario presented.
