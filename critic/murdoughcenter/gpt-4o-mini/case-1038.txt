The answer provided is ethical. It emphasizes the importance of transparency and accountability in addressing the conflict of interest presented by Elias and Shellie's undisclosed property ownership. By scheduling a meeting to confront them directly, Daulton takes a proactive approach to resolve the ethical issue rather than ignoring it or attempting to cover it up. 

The recommendation to insist on disclosure to relevant stakeholders, including Walbert Township and ClearWaterâ€™s management, is crucial for maintaining trust and integrity in the engineering profession. Documenting the conversation and their agreement to disclose further reinforces the commitment to ethical practices. 

Additionally, the suggestion to escalate the issue if Elias and Shellie refuse to cooperate demonstrates a commitment to ethical standards, even at the potential cost of personal or corporate interests. This approach not only addresses the immediate ethical breach but also protects the long-term reputation of ClearWater Developers and the trust of the communities involved.

Overall, the answer is specific, practical, and aligns with ethical engineering practices, making it a sound course of action.
