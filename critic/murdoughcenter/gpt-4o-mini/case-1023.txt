The proposed actions in the answer are ethical and demonstrate a responsible approach to the situation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the evaluation:

1. **Transparency and Communication**: The decision to schedule a meeting with the firm's leadership to discuss the situation shows a commitment to transparency. By sharing the information about Moover's practices, the engineer is ensuring that the leadership is fully informed and can make decisions based on accurate data.

2. **Addressing Concerns**: Proposing to formally communicate concerns to Moover is a constructive step. Drafting a letter or email to express disappointment and seek clarification is a professional way to address the issue. This approach allows for an open dialogue and gives Moover a chance to rectify the situation.

3. **Seeking Clarity**: Requesting a clear outline of the expected role in the project is practical and necessary. It ensures that the firm understands its position and can plan accordingly.

4. **Contingency Planning**: The recommendation to consider withdrawing from the exclusive arrangement if Moover does not respond satisfactorily is a prudent measure. It protects the firm's interests and encourages them to seek partnerships with firms that value their contributions.

Overall, the actions proposed are ethical as they prioritize communication, transparency, and the firm's interests while maintaining professionalism. The approach is specific and practical, addressing the immediate concerns while also considering long-term implications.
