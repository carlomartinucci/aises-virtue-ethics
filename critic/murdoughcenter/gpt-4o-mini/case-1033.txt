Dianne's proposed course of action is ethical. She recognizes the potential conflict between Warren's suggestion and the established DOT policy, which is crucial for maintaining transparency and accountability in public projects. By documenting her concerns and outlining the implications of altering the design, she demonstrates a commitment to ethical standards and professional integrity.

Requesting a meeting with Warren to discuss her findings is a practical step that allows for open communication and the opportunity to address any misunderstandings. This approach shows respect for her superior while also standing firm on ethical grounds.

If Warren persists in his request to change the design, escalating the issue to a higher authority is a responsible action. It ensures that the project adheres to state policies and protects Dianne's professional reputation. This escalation is not only justified but necessary to uphold the ethical standards of her profession and to advocate for the best interests of the citizens of Shadyvale.

Overall, Dianne's response is specific, practical, and aligns with ethical principles, making it a commendable course of action.
