The answer provided is ethical. It demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing a potentially unethical expectation from a supervisor. By scheduling a private meeting with Charlie Oxx, the individual is taking a responsible step to clarify their position and express their discomfort with the expectation of making political contributions. This approach allows for open communication and seeks to find a resolution that aligns with both personal values and professional obligations.

The individualâ€™s intention to maintain professional integrity while also showing commitment to the firm is commendable. They are not outright refusing to support the firm but are instead seeking guidance on how to navigate the situation ethically. This shows a willingness to engage in dialogue rather than simply acquiescing to pressure, which is a responsible and ethical stance.
