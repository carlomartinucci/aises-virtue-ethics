It addresses the potential issues raised in the scenario without making unfounded accusations, focusing instead on the need for proper procedures to be followed. This approach not only seeks to protect the university's reputation but also promotes accountability in public projects.

Overall, the response is grounded in specific actions that can lead to positive change, making it an ethical course of action.
