The answer provided is ethical as it promotes transparency and honesty in billing practices, which are essential for maintaining trust and integrity in client relationships. By choosing not to take advantage of the CCC service that allows for an internal markup on long distance telephone charges, the individual is ensuring that clients are billed fairly and accurately for the expenses incurred.

However, it would be beneficial to also consider the potential impact of not passing on overhead costs to clients. While it is important to be transparent, it is also essential to ensure that the business remains financially sustainable. By absorbing all overhead costs associated with long distance telephone charges, the firm may be operating at a loss, which could have long-term negative consequences on its financial health.

To address this, the individual could explore alternative solutions such as negotiating with clients to cover a portion of the overhead costs or finding ways to streamline internal processes to reduce the impact of these expenses. It is crucial to strike a balance between transparency and financial viability to ensure the long-term success of the consulting firm.
