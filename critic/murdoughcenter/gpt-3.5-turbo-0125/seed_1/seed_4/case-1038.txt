The suggested course of action for Daulton to immediately inform ClearWater's legal department about the conflict of interest involving Elias and Shellie is indeed ethical and appropriate. By providing all relevant documentation and working with the legal team to address the issue transparently, Daulton demonstrates a commitment to integrity and ethical business practices. This approach prioritizes the company's reputation and ensures that potential conflicts of interest are handled responsibly.

However, it is important to note that Daulton should also consider the potential consequences of his actions. While it is crucial to disclose the conflict of interest, Daulton should be prepared for the fallout that may follow, both internally within the company and externally if the information becomes public. Additionally, steps should be taken to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future, such as implementing clearer disclosure policies and oversight mechanisms.

Overall, the suggested response is specific, practical, and actionable, offering a clear path forward for Daulton to address the ethical dilemma effectively. It emphasizes the importance of honesty and transparency in business dealings, ultimately aiming to safeguard ClearWater's integrity and credibility in the long run.
