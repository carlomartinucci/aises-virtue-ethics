The answer provided is specific, actionable, and practical. Advising Roger to document his concerns in writing and keep a record for his protection is a good recommendation. Suggesting that he discuss his concerns with a trusted colleague or mentor within the firm is also a practical step to seek advice on handling the situation professionally. The advice to exercise caution when sharing sensitive project information and follow proper protocols for handling confidential client data in the future shows a proactive approach to maintaining trust and integrity within the firm.

However, one area that could be improved is emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations in the decision-making process. While the answer provides practical steps for Roger to take, it could have highlighted the ethical implications of sharing confidential information with individuals who may have conflicting interests more explicitly. Bringing a stronger ethical perspective into the evaluation would have further enhanced the response.
