Gwen's initial steps of reviewing company policies and guidelines show a good understanding of the importance of following established rules. Scheduling a meeting with Lawrence to address her concerns demonstrates proactive communication and a willingness to address the issue directly. Additionally, proposing alternative solutions to monitoring email usage and conducting training sessions on email etiquette shows a thoughtful approach to addressing the problem.

On the downside, Gwen may need to be more assertive in expressing her concerns about the potential breach of trust and invasion of privacy to Lawrence. She should clearly communicate the ethical implications of accessing employees' email files without consent and the negative impact it could have on the work environment. Additionally, she could consider involving HR or legal departments to ensure that any actions taken are in line with legal and ethical standards.

Overall, Gwen's approach is practical and actionable, focusing on finding alternative solutions while upholding both company policies and ethical considerations. By being more assertive in expressing her concerns and involving relevant departments, Gwen can further strengthen her response to this challenging situation.
