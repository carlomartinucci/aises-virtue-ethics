The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of transparency and integrity in legal proceedings. By recommending that the information about the personal relationship between Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert be disclosed to the court, it addresses the potential conflict of interest that may arise from their living arrangement and working relationship on the Kinkora case. This action helps to uphold the fairness and credibility of the trial.

However, the answer could be improved by also suggesting steps to mitigate the conflict of interest, such as recommending the appointment of a new expert witness in place of Cleghorn to ensure unbiased testimony. By providing actionable solutions to address the ethical concerns raised, the response could offer a more comprehensive approach to handling the situation effectively.
