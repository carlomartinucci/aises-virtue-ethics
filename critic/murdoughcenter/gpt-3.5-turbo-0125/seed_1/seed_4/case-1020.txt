The response provided is specific and actionable. Attending the mediation hearing as requested by Noall's attorney to present technical facts is a good approach, as it allows for the evidence to be properly considered. Maintaining the position of not participating in the settlement financially is also a sensible decision, given the belief that your firm does not bear any financial responsibility for the issues with the pile installations. Calmly explaining this stance during the mediation and seeking legal advice to protect your Professional Engineer's license in the face of threats from John Dour are practical steps to take.

However, it would be beneficial to also consider proactively gathering and preparing all relevant technical evidence and documentation to support your firm's position before the mediation hearing. This can help strengthen your case and demonstrate your firm's adherence to professional standards. Additionally, it may be worth exploring potential avenues for resolving the situation amicably with all parties involved, such as proposing alternative solutions or compromises that do not involve financial contributions from your firm.

Overall, the response demonstrates a clear understanding of the situation and offers practical steps to address the challenge effectively.
