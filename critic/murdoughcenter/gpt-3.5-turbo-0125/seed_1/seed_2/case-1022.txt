The answers provided are ethical to some extent as they address the factors that should be considered in determining the fee for working with Zeller Construction or Hartwell Construction. 

In Question 1, the answer appropriately considers the complexity of the project, the level of effort required, potential value to Zeller Construction, and market rates for similar services. This is good as it ensures a fair fee based on the actual work involved and the value provided.

In Question 2, the response also factors in the value of expertise to Hartwell, potential impact on project success, and competitive landscape. Additionally, acknowledging the potential long-term relationship and goodwill with Hartwell is positive, as it recognizes the importance of maintaining positive business relationships.

In Question 3, the answer correctly notes that the fee determination for working with Zeller Construction would likely remain the same even if Hartwell decides not to bid on the project. This shows consistency in considering the value of expertise and potential benefits to the client.

To improve, the answers could be more specific by providing examples of how each factor would be weighed in determining the fee. Additionally, considering any conflicts of interest that may arise by working with both companies could further enhance the ethical evaluation.

Overall, the responses demonstrate a good understanding of the ethical considerations in determining fees for consulting services, but could benefit from more specific examples and addressing potential conflicts of interest.
