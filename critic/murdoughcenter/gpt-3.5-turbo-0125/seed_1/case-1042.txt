The answer provided is ethical as it encourages Rashid to prioritize quality and safety concerns over potential conflicts with his superiors. It suggests concrete actions for Rashid to take, such as scheduling a meeting with the building inspector, documenting his observations, and seeking guidance from a more experienced colleague. These actions demonstrate a proactive approach to addressing the issue while also seeking support and guidance within the organization.

However, one potential drawback is that the answer does not address the potential consequences or risks that Rashid may face by challenging the subcontractor and his boss. It would be beneficial to include advice on how Rashid can navigate these potential challenges while still advocating for quality and safety on the project.
