The advice given to Roger is practical and actionable. By documenting his concerns in writing and seeking advice from a trusted colleague or mentor, Roger is taking proactive steps to protect himself and address the ethical dilemma he is facing. Keeping a record of the events can serve as evidence in case any issues arise in the future, demonstrating his commitment to transparency and integrity. Discussing his concerns with a colleague or mentor can provide him with additional perspectives and guidance on how to navigate similar situations in the future.

However, the advice could be strengthened by suggesting that Roger escalate the issue to a higher authority within the firm if his concerns are not adequately addressed by his immediate supervisor. This additional step could help ensure that the firm upholds ethical standards and prevents any potential misuse of sensitive project information. Encouraging Roger to familiarize himself with the firm's policies on data confidentiality and to follow proper protocols consistently would also reinforce the importance of maintaining trust and integrity within the organization.
