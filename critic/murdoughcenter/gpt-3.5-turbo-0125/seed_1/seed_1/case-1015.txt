The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the long-term structural integrity of the buildings over short-term cost savings. It demonstrates professionalism by clearly communicating the technical basis for the recommendation of using pile foundations and outlining the risks associated with using shallow footings in compressible soils. Offering to provide a detailed explanation in writing and consulting with senior colleagues or professional engineering associations for guidance also shows a commitment to upholding ethical standards and seeking further expertise when needed.

To improve the response further, the geotechnical engineer could explicitly state the potential consequences of not following their professional recommendation, such as the financial costs and reputational damage that could arise from structural issues in the future. Additionally, proposing a compromise solution that addresses the contractor's concerns while still prioritizing long-term stability could enhance the practicality of the response. This could involve suggesting a phased approach where shallow footings are used for the warranty period with a plan for transitioning to pile foundations afterward to mitigate long-term settlement issues.
