The answer provided is ethical and practical. By advising Daulton to immediately inform ClearWater's legal department about the conflict of interest involving Elias and Shellie, it addresses the core ethical issue at hand. The suggestion to provide all relevant documentation, work with the legal team, and prioritize integrity and transparency in handling the situation is crucial for maintaining ethical practices and protecting ClearWater's reputation.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on taking concrete steps to address the conflict of interest, such as disclosing the information to relevant parties and revising the plat to accurately reflect ownership. This demonstrates a commitment to rectifying the situation and upholding ethical standards within the organization.

However, one area for improvement could be to also recommend implementing internal controls or procedures to prevent similar conflicts of interest from arising in the future. By proactively addressing the root cause of the issue, Daulton and ClearWater can mitigate the risk of such ethical dilemmas occurring again.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and actionable plan for handling the conflict of interest, focusing on transparency, integrity, and ethical decision-making. By following these recommendations, Daulton can navigate this challenging situation while upholding ethical standards within the organization.
