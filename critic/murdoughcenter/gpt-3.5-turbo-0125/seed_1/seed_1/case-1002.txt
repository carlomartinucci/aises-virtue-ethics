The answer provided is ethical to a large extent. It focuses on addressing the concerns and expressing disappointment with Ralph's sudden departure, emphasizing the impact on the team and office operations. It also mentions seeking clarity on future plans for the office and discussing the situation with management in Boston to provide feedback and guidance on next steps. These actions show a sense of responsibility towards the team and the organization.

However, there are a few areas for improvement. The response could have suggested offering support to the remaining staff in the office who were left behind, ensuring they feel valued and supported during the transition. Additionally, it could have included a suggestion to maintain professionalism and integrity throughout the process, avoiding any negative impact on the reputation of the departing employees or the company.

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for handling the situation ethically, but it could benefit from more emphasis on supporting the remaining team members and maintaining professionalism in all interactions.
