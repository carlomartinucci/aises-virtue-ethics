The answer provided is ethical as it aligns with the clients' expectations of being billed for expenses at actual cost without any additional markup. By choosing not to sign up for the internal markup plan offered by CCC, the consultant is demonstrating integrity and transparency in their billing practices, which can help build trust and maintain good relationships with clients. This approach also avoids any potential conflicts of interest that could arise from adding a markup on expenses that clients expect to be passed on at actual cost.

However, it is important to consider the potential financial implications of not participating in the plan. By not taking advantage of the opportunity to recoup overhead costs associated with long-distance telephone charges, the firm may be missing out on a chance to improve its profitability. It would be advisable for the consultant to evaluate the financial impact of continuing to bill clients at actual cost and consider whether there are alternative ways to recover these overhead costs without compromising transparency or client relationships.

In summary, while the decision to maintain the current billing practice is commendable for its ethical considerations, it would be prudent for the consultant to assess the financial implications and explore potential alternatives to ensure the firm's sustainability and competitiveness in the long run.
