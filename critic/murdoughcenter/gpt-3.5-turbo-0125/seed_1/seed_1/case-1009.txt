The answer provided is ethical as it highlights expressing disappointment, concern, and the importance of following through with the agreed-upon proposal to the developer. It also emphasizes the potential risks involved in changing the terms of the agreement, especially regarding structural integrity and safety. Additionally, requesting a meeting to discuss the situation further and clarify any misunderstandings shows a proactive approach to resolving the issue.

On the positive side, the answer stresses the importance of open communication and addressing concerns directly with the developer. It also encourages seeking clarification and understanding the reasoning behind the decision made.

However, a more actionable approach could be suggested. For instance, in addition to expressing disappointment and concern, the individual could propose a revised agreement that ensures fair compensation for the detailed scope of work provided. Setting clear boundaries and expectations moving forward would be beneficial. Additionally, seeking legal advice on how to protect the original proposal's intellectual property and ensuring fair compensation could be considered. This would provide a more concrete plan of action to protect the interests of the individual and their firm.
