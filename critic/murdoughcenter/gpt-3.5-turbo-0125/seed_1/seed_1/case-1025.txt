The answer provided is ethical as it upholds honesty and integrity in the face of potential legal action. By declining the settlement offer and choosing to defend the firm in court, the focus remains on presenting the evidence and documentation that supports the firm's position. This approach aligns with ethical principles by emphasizing transparency and accountability for the actions taken by the firm in advising the bank and communicating the need for permissions regarding the tiebacks on the adjacent property.

However, to improve the response, it would be beneficial to suggest proactively engaging with the bank and its project manager to clarify the situation and potentially involve them in the legal proceedings to share responsibility. Additionally, exploring options for mediation or negotiation with the adjacent property owner could be considered to resolve the issue amicably while still maintaining the integrity of the firm's actions.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a commitment to ethical conduct by standing by the firm's professional advice and handling the legal situation with integrity and evidence-based defense.
