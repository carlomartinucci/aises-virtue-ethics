The answer provided is fair and practical in addressing the situation at hand. By agreeing to attend the mediation hearing to present the technical facts but refusing to participate financially in the settlement, the response demonstrates a commitment to upholding professional integrity and standing by the evidence that supports the firm's innocence in the matter. Suggesting seeking legal advice to protect the Professional Engineer's license shows a proactive approach to safeguarding professional credentials in the face of threats.

Overall, the response appropriately balances the need to cooperate in the resolution process while maintaining the firm's stance on financial responsibility. It could be improved by suggesting documenting all communications and interactions related to the claim settlement to have a clear record of the firm's position and actions taken. Additionally, outlining a plan to follow up after the mediation to ensure the firm's reputation and license are protected would further enhance the practicality of the response.
