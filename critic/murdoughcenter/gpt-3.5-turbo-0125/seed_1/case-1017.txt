The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of honesty, integrity, and respect for intellectual property rights in the engineering profession. By advising Bert to inform his superiors at Far Horizons Engineering about the situation, provide details about his previous involvement with the original drawings, and offer to assist in investigating the matter further, the answer promotes transparency and accountability.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting that Bert should also document his findings and conversations regarding the drawings to have a record of his actions and concerns. Additionally, it would be beneficial to recommend that Bert consult with legal counsel or an ethics committee within the engineering community to ensure that he follows the appropriate procedures in handling this situation.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for Bert to address the issue of potential unauthorized use of intellectual property, but it could be enhanced by including specific steps for Bert to take in terms of documentation and seeking further guidance from relevant authorities.
