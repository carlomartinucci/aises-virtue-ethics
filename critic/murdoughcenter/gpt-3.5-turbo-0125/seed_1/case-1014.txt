The answer provided is practical and actionable. Advising Roger to document his concerns in writing and keep a record for his protection is a good step to take. Suggesting that he discuss his concerns with a trusted colleague or mentor within the firm shows a proactive approach to seeking advice and guidance. The recommendation to exercise caution when sharing sensitive project information and to follow proper protocols for handling confidential data is essential for maintaining trust and integrity within the firm.

However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the importance of clear communication with his superiors about his discomfort in sharing the draft report with Frank Bullock. It would be beneficial to encourage Roger to express his concerns directly to his boss, Bill Mason, and seek clarification on the firm's policies regarding sharing project information with external parties. Additionally, providing specific steps or strategies for Roger to address the situation with Frank Bullock, such as requesting feedback on the draft report only from authorized personnel, would enhance the practicality of the advice given.

Overall, the response offers a solid foundation for Roger to address the ethical dilemma he is facing, but it could be strengthened by including more explicit guidance on how to navigate the situation effectively within the organizational context.
