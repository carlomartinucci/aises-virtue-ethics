The answer provided is ethical as it addresses the potential conflict of interest arising from the personal relationship between Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert, which could impact the fairness of the legal proceedings. By suggesting that this information should be disclosed to the court for transparency, it upholds the principles of fairness and integrity in the legal process.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how to handle the situation practically. For instance, it could recommend documenting the details of the personal relationship, advising the legal team on how to approach disclosing this information to the court, and suggesting steps to mitigate any potential bias or conflict of interest that may arise.

Overall, the answer is on the right track by identifying the issue of conflict of interest and recommending disclosure, but it could be enhanced by offering more actionable steps to address the situation effectively.
