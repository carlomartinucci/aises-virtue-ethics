Your answer is practical and specific in addressing the potential conflict of interest arising from the personal relationship between Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert. By advising to inform Fulton Adams about this information and recommending disclosure to the court, you are taking a proactive step to uphold transparency and integrity in the legal proceedings. This action can help prevent any bias or unethical conduct that may arise from their relationship.

However, one area for improvement is to also consider the ethical implications for yourself in this situation. As an engineering consultant involved in the case, it is essential to maintain your own ethical standards and avoid any perception of impropriety. You could suggest discussing with Fulton Adams the impact this situation may have on your role as an expert witness and ensure that your own involvement remains unbiased and credible.

Overall, your response is clear and actionable in addressing the potential conflict of interest, but it would benefit from including a brief reflection on how this situation could affect your own ethical responsibilities in the case.
