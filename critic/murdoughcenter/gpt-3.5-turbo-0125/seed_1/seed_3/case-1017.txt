The answer provided is ethical and practical. Bert's decision to inform his superiors at Far Horizons Engineering about the situation regarding the drawings shows integrity and a commitment to ethical conduct in the engineering profession. By offering to assist in investigating the matter further and emphasizing the importance of respecting intellectual property rights, Bert is taking proactive steps to address the issue.

One positive aspect of this response is that it prioritizes transparency and honesty in dealing with potential ethical concerns. By being upfront about his previous involvement with the original drawings and expressing his concerns, Bert is demonstrating accountability for his actions.

However, one area for improvement could be to also consider reaching out to his former employer, County Line Design, to clarify whether any permissions were granted for the use of the drawings. This additional step could help gather more information to resolve the situation effectively and ensure that all parties involved are aware of the issue.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and actionable course of action for Bert to follow, highlighting the importance of upholding ethical standards and addressing potential intellectual property violations in a professional manner.
