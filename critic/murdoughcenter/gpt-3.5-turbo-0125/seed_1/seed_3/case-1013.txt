Your answer is practical and specific, considering the client's situation and the potential consequences of not complying with the directive. By highlighting the importance of providing accurate information to clients, preventing financial harm, and acknowledging the impact on your professional future, you have demonstrated a clear rationale for your decision. 

One aspect to consider further is the ethical dilemma presented in this scenario. While following your manager's directive may seem like the most practical choice given the circumstances, it is important to also consider the ethical implications of potentially withholding information about contamination from the final report. 

To improve your response, you could have acknowledged the ethical gray area and discussed ways to address it, such as seeking guidance from a higher authority within the organization or proposing alternative solutions that prioritize both the client's interests and ethical considerations. This would have added depth to your evaluation and provided a more comprehensive analysis of the situation.
