The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the long-term structural integrity of the buildings over short-term gains. The response demonstrates a proactive approach to communication, explaining the technical reasoning behind the recommendation for pile foundations and the associated risks of using shallow footings. Offering to provide a detailed written explanation and citing industry standards to support the recommendation further strengthens the argument for the preferred course of action.

However, to improve the answer further, it could explicitly mention the potential consequences of not following the professional recommendation, such as legal liabilities or reputational damage in case of future structural issues. Additionally, suggesting a collaborative approach with the contractor to find a mutually agreeable solution that balances both short-term and long-term considerations would enhance the practicality of the response.

Overall, the response is commendable for its clear communication and commitment to upholding professional standards, but it could benefit from including more explicit details on the possible repercussions of disregarding the geotechnical engineer's expert advice and exploring collaborative problem-solving strategies with the contractor.
