The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it involves transparent communication with the client, explaining the reasoning behind the cost estimate for the new project site. By emphasizing the cost savings achieved through leveraging existing information and analyses from the Dawson site, it demonstrates a commitment to efficiency and cost-effectiveness for the client.

However, one potential ethical concern is the fact that the original contract budget for the Dawson project was exceeded without authorization, resulting in a loss of profit for the firm. There should have been better monitoring of the project's expenses to prevent such a situation from occurring. Moving forward, it would be important to establish clearer protocols for managing project budgets and obtaining approval for any additional work that may incur extra costs.

In summary, while the response demonstrates ethical behavior through transparent communication and cost-effectiveness, there is room for improvement in terms of budget monitoring and approval processes to prevent profit losses in future projects.
