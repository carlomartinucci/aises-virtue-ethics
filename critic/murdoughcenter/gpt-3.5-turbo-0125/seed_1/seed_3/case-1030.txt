The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes safety and regulatory compliance over potential project delays or upsetting stakeholders. It emphasizes the importance of independently verifying information, consulting with a qualified expert, and communicating effectively with the project team. By suggesting Reilly take proactive steps to ensure the facility meets safety requirements, the answer promotes integrity and professional responsibility.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how Reilly should handle the situation if the room is found to be non-compliant. It could suggest steps for addressing the issue with stakeholders, such as developing a plan for bringing the facility up to code and communicating effectively with Bull Parker and the town commissioner. Additionally, the answer could highlight the potential consequences of non-compliance in more detail to underscore the importance of taking action.

Overall, the answer offers a strong foundation for ethical decision-making but could benefit from additional specific recommendations for addressing the issue comprehensively and effectively.
