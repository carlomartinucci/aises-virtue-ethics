The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of integrity, transparency, and taking appropriate action to address the conflict of interest involving Elias and Shellie. By recommending that Daulton inform ClearWater's legal department and work with them to address the issue, the answer promotes accountability and ethical behavior within the organization.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific steps that Daulton should take to address the conflict of interest. For example, it could suggest conducting a thorough investigation into the extent of Elias and Shellie's involvement, determining the potential impact on the project and stakeholders, and developing a clear plan for disclosure and mitigation.

Overall, the answer is a good starting point for addressing the ethical dilemma, but it could benefit from more detailed and actionable steps to ensure a comprehensive and effective resolution.
