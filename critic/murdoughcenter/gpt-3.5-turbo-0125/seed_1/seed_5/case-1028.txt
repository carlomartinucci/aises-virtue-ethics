The answer provided is ethical as it aligns with the clients' expectations for expenses to be passed on at actual cost without any additional markup. By choosing not to sign up for the plan that allows for internal markup on long distance telephone charges, the consultant is maintaining transparency in billing practices, which can help build trust and maintain good relationships with clients.

However, it would be beneficial to take further action by actively communicating with clients about the billing process for out-of-pocket expenses, including long distance telephone charges. By proactively discussing the billing procedures and ensuring clients understand the breakdown of costs, the consultant can enhance transparency and strengthen client relationships even further. This can help prevent any potential misunderstandings or concerns regarding billing practices in the future.

In summary, while the decision not to sign up for the internal markup plan is commendable, enhancing communication with clients regarding billing practices can contribute to building stronger relationships and trust, ultimately benefiting the consultant-client dynamic in the long term.
