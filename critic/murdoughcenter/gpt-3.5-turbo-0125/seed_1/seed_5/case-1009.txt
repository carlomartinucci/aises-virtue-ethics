The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on expressing disappointment and concern to Mr. Young, reminding him of the effort put into preparing the proposal, emphasizing the importance of following through with the agreed-upon terms, highlighting the risks of changing the agreement, and requesting a meeting to discuss the situation further. These actions are aimed at addressing the issue professionally and seeking clarification on the decision made by the developer.

To improve the response, it could be more actionable by suggesting specific steps to take during the meeting with Mr. Young. For instance, proposing to renegotiate the terms of the agreement to ensure fair compensation for the detailed scope of work prepared, discussing the potential impact on the quality and safety of the project due to the change in plans, and outlining a clear path forward to resolve the situation amicably.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of ethical considerations in the given scenario, but adding more specific and actionable steps would enhance the response further.
