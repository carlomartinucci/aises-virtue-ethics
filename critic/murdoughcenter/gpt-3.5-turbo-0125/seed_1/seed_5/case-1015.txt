The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the long-term structural integrity of the buildings over short-term considerations. By firmly but respectfully communicating the potential risks and consequences of using shallow footings in compressible soils to the contractor, the geotechnical engineer maintains their professional integrity. Additionally, offering to provide a detailed written explanation and citing industry standards to support their recommendation demonstrates a commitment to ensuring the safety and stability of the project.

However, the response could be further improved by explicitly stating the potential legal and ethical implications of deviating from the professional recommendation. Including a clause about the obligation to adhere to ethical standards and the responsibility to protect public safety and welfare would reinforce the importance of upholding professional integrity in engineering decisions. Moreover, suggesting a clear course of action in case the contractor persists in their request, such as seeking legal advice or escalating the issue within the company, would provide a more actionable approach to handling the situation.
