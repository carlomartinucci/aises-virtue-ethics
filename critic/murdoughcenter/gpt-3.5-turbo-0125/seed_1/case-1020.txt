By agreeing to attend the mediation hearing to present technical facts but refusing to participate financially in the settlement, the response demonstrates a clear understanding of the ethical stance to uphold the integrity of the firm's work.

Additionally, outlining a strategy to communicate effectively with all parties involved, including Noall and the developer, to ensure transparency and clarity in the situation would enhance the overall evaluation.
