The answer provided is ethical to a certain extent. Seeking clarification from Charlie Oxx about the expectations and potential impact on career advancement is a good first step. It shows a willingness to understand the situation better before making a decision. However, the answer could be improved by explicitly stating a commitment to upholding ethical standards and not engaging in any actions that could be perceived as unethical or potentially illegal. It would be beneficial to mention a willingness to escalate the issue if necessary, such as reporting the situation to higher authorities within the company or seeking advice from an external ethics committee. Overall, the answer is practical and actionable, but it could be strengthened by emphasizing a clear stance on ethical behavior and potential consequences for non-compliance.
