The answer provided is practical and actionable. It correctly advises Roger to document his concerns and the events in writing, which is a good practice for protecting himself in case any issues arise in the future. It also suggests that he should be cautious about sharing sensitive project information with individuals who may have conflicting interests and seek guidance from a more neutral party within the organization if needed.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific steps for Roger to take in the future. For example, it could recommend that Roger discuss his concerns with the firm's ethics or compliance officer, or suggest ways for him to address the situation directly with Frank Bullock or higher management. Additionally, it could emphasize the importance of maintaining confidentiality and integrity in all dealings with sensitive project information.

Overall, the answer is a good starting point for Roger to handle the current situation and be more prepared for similar challenges in the future, but it could benefit from more detailed and specific guidance on how to navigate such ethical dilemmas effectively.
