The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on seeking guidance and clarification within the company's existing policies and values. By reviewing the company's policies, scheduling a meeting with HR, and documenting the advice received, the individual is taking proactive steps to address the ethical dilemma they are facing.

On the positive side, the individual is showing a willingness to seek guidance and clarification on how to navigate the situation in an ethical manner. By involving HR, they are also involving a neutral party that can provide objective advice.

However, one potential drawback is the lack of immediate action or a clear plan of how to address the issue beyond seeking guidance from HR. It would be beneficial for the individual to also consider discussing the situation with a mentor or trusted colleague for additional perspectives and support.

Overall, the response demonstrates a good initial step in addressing the ethical dilemma, but there is room for improvement in terms of developing a more comprehensive plan to navigate the situation effectively.
