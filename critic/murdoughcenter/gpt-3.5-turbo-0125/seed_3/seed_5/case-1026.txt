The suggested course of action for Jack in this scenario is highly ethical and comprehensive. By immediately contacting the drilling crew and geologist for clarification on the drilling operations, requesting additional information, and reviewing existing data meticulously, Jack demonstrates a commitment to ensuring the accuracy of his analyses and design recommendations. Engaging an independent third-party expert for verification adds an extra layer of reliability to the process, showcasing a proactive approach to mitigating risks.

Furthermore, transparent communication with the client about the challenges faced and potential delays exhibits professionalism and honesty. By working towards finding a solution that aligns with the client's project timeline while upholding professional standards, Jack prioritizes integrity and accountability.

One area for improvement could be to document each step taken in the verification process thoroughly. Keeping detailed records of communications, findings, and decisions made can serve as a valuable reference in case of any future inquiries or audits.

Overall, the proposed actions are practical, specific, and actionable, aligning with ethical principles of diligence, transparency, and professionalism in handling a complex situation that impacts the accuracy and reliability of engineering recommendations.
