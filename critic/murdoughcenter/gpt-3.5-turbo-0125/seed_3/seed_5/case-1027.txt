The answer provided is ethical as it demonstrates transparency and honesty in dealing with the client, Bill Broot, regarding the cost estimate for the new project site. By informing him of the reduced cost due to the reuse of information from the Dawson site, the answer aligns with ethical principles of fairness and integrity.

However, there are areas for improvement in the response. It would be beneficial to also address the issue of the budget overrun in the Dawson project and how it has impacted the firm's finances. By discussing this openly with Bill Broot, it can help in setting realistic expectations for future projects and potentially renegotiating terms to avoid similar situations.

Furthermore, while emphasizing cost savings is important, it is equally essential to stress the quality and value of the services being provided. This can help ensure that the focus remains on delivering high-quality work within budget constraints.

Overall, the answer demonstrates ethical behavior by being transparent with the client about the cost estimate, but it could be enhanced by addressing the budget overrun issue and emphasizing the value proposition of the services offered.
