The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it aims to ensure transparency and fairness in legal proceedings by bringing relevant information to the attention of the legal counsel. By documenting the information about Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert's relationship and informing Fulton Adams, the consultant is taking steps to address a potential conflict of interest and maintain the integrity of the legal process.

However, the answer could benefit from a more proactive approach. Instead of simply informing Fulton Adams about the discovered information, the consultant could suggest specific actions to address the potential conflict of interest. For example, recommending that Adams raise the issue with the court or seek clarification from Cleghorn about his relationship with Cuthbert could help ensure that the legal proceedings are conducted impartially.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a commitment to upholding ethical standards by addressing a potential conflict of interest. To improve, the consultant could offer more actionable recommendations to mitigate the impact of the discovered information on the case.
