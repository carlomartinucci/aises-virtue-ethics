The answer provided is ethical to a certain extent. It correctly identifies the need for Roger to express his concerns to his boss, Bill Mason, regarding the potential ethical issues arising from providing a draft report to Frank Bullock before it is finalized and submitted to the client. It also suggests requesting further clarification on the firm's practices in such situations and seeking guidance on handling similar requests in the future to prevent conflicts of interest.

However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the importance of maintaining client confidentiality and the integrity of the firm's work. It should advise Roger to firmly stand his ground if he feels uncomfortable with the situation, even if his boss reassures him that it is a common practice. Roger should be encouraged to prioritize ethical considerations over potential business gains and to seek support from higher management or a professional ethics committee within the firm if necessary.

Overall, the answer provides a good starting point for Roger to address the issue, but it could be enhanced by stressing the need for ethical decision-making and the potential consequences of compromising client trust and professional integrity.
