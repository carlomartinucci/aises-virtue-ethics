The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on expressing disappointment, seeking feedback, and maintaining a professional relationship with the client. It is good that the response emphasizes open communication, seeking clarification on the decision-making process, and showing a willingness to learn from the experience.

However, a more actionable approach could involve requesting a meeting with Mr. Young to discuss the situation further, including asking for specific feedback on why the competitor was chosen over your firm. This would help you understand any shortcomings in your proposal and improve for future submissions. Additionally, it could be beneficial to negotiate a potential collaboration or involvement in the project despite the initial decision.

Overall, the response is ethical and professional, but it could be enhanced by taking more concrete steps to address the situation and gather valuable feedback for future proposals.
