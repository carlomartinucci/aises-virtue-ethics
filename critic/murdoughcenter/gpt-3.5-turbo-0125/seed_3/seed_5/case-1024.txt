The answer provided is ethical as it advises Rod to report the suspicious activity he has observed to the appropriate authorities within the Department of Transportation (DOT) promptly. By suggesting that Rod should inform Ethel Hicks, Jim Upwright's supervisor, the answer targets a relevant individual who has the authority to address the issue.

However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the importance of documenting the observations and any relevant details before reporting them. Encouraging Rod to keep a record of the incidents and any additional information he gathers can strengthen his case when bringing the matter to the attention of Ethel Hicks. Additionally, it would be beneficial to advise Rod on how to protect himself from potential repercussions or conflicts that may arise from reporting such behavior, such as maintaining confidentiality and seeking guidance from his university advisor, Dr. R. E. Serchur.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and ethical course of action for Rod to follow by reporting the suspicious activity to the appropriate authority. Strengthening it with practical steps for documentation and self-protection would make it even more actionable and beneficial for Rod in this situation.
