The response given is clear and actionable, emphasizing the importance of integrity, adherence to policies, and prioritizing the interests of the State DOT and the citizens of Shadyvale. The advice to stick to the original design and not deviate from the standard procedures is a commendable approach. By encouraging Dianne to prioritize ethics and professionalism, the response provides a solid foundation for handling the situation effectively.

However, the response could be further enhanced by suggesting that Dianne should address the issue directly with Warren, expressing her concerns about the potential conflict with State DOT policy and seeking guidance on how to proceed in a manner that aligns with the regulations. Open communication with her superior could lead to a resolution that upholds integrity while also addressing the practical implications of the project.

Overall, the response offers a good starting point for Dianne to navigate the ethical dilemma she faces, but could benefit from additional guidance on how to engage in constructive dialogue with Warren to resolve the situation transparently.
