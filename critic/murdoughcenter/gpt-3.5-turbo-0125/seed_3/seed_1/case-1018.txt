The answer provided is ethical as it addresses the issue of academic dishonesty in a fair and responsible manner. Gathering evidence, meeting with the students individually, confronting them with the evidence, and giving them a chance to explain themselves are all appropriate steps to take. Resubmitting new, original project reports with penalties for academic dishonesty, emphasizing integrity, and documenting the process are all positive actions that uphold academic standards.

However, there are areas for improvement. The response could benefit from explicitly mentioning the university's policies on academic dishonesty and involving relevant authorities or committees in the decision-making process. Additionally, the answer could have included a clearer plan for ensuring that the consequences of academic misconduct are understood by the students and that future incidents are prevented. Providing additional support or resources for students who may be struggling with the coursework could also be considered to address the root causes of the issue.

Overall, the response is comprehensive and takes appropriate steps to handle the situation, but it could be strengthened by incorporating specific references to institutional policies, preventative measures, and additional support for students.
