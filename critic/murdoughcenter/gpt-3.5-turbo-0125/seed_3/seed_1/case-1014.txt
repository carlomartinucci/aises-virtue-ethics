The answer provided is ethical to a certain extent. It correctly advises Roger to express his concerns to his boss, Bill Mason, regarding the potential ethical issues of sharing a draft report with Frank Bullock before finalizing it for the client. This action aligns with ethical principles by emphasizing transparency and integrity in dealings with clients. The suggestion to seek further clarification on the firm's policies and guidance on handling similar situations in the future is also commendable.

However, the evaluation could be improved by emphasizing the need for Roger to firmly stand his ground on ethical principles and potentially refuse similar requests if they compromise the integrity of the work or the client's interests. It could have also highlighted the importance of documenting such instances and seeking guidance from relevant professional bodies or ethics committees if necessary.

Overall, the response provides a good starting point for addressing the ethical dilemma but could benefit from a stronger stance on upholding ethical standards and seeking additional support or resources if needed.
