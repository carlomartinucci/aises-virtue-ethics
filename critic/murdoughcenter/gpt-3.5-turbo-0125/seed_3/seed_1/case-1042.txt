The suggested course of action for Rashid is commendable in several ways. Documenting observations and concerns is a good practice to have a clear record of the issue. Scheduling a meeting with Riley to present findings and express concerns professionally shows initiative and good communication skills. Emphasizing the importance of quality control and safety in construction projects is crucial for ethical decision-making. Proposing solutions and following up to ensure actions are taken demonstrates a proactive approach to problem-solving.

However, there are some potential drawbacks to this approach. Rashid should be cautious about how he presents his concerns to Riley, considering Riley's dismissive attitude towards the issue previously. It may also be challenging for Rashid to assert his stance as a new and inexperienced employee, especially when Riley has a different perspective on the situation. Additionally, Rashid should be prepared for potential pushback or resistance from Riley, given his focus on project timelines and progress.

Overall, the suggested actions are practical and actionable, providing a framework for Rashid to address the issue effectively. Rashid should proceed with confidence and persistence while remaining respectful and professional in his interactions with his supervisor.
