The answer provided is specific and actionable. By attending the mediation hearing and presenting the technical evidence, the individual is taking a proactive step to defend their firm's position. They are emphasizing the importance of maintaining the integrity of their work and highlighting the key points that absolve their firm from financial responsibility.

However, it would be beneficial to also consider the potential consequences of not attending the mediation as threatened by John Dour. While the individual is rightfully standing by their firm's work and evidence, they may need to weigh the risks associated with potential repercussions such as the threat to their professional engineering license and the loss of future business opportunities with Noall Engineers. It might be prudent to seek legal advice on how to navigate this situation while protecting their professional standing and reputation.

Overall, the response addresses the immediate action to be taken at the mediation, but a more comprehensive evaluation of the potential risks and long-term implications of different courses of action could enhance the response.
