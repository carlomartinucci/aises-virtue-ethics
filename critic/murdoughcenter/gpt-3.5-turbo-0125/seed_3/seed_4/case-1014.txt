The answer provided is ethical to a certain extent. It acknowledges the potential ethical concerns of sharing draft reports with individuals outside the project team before finalization and submission to the client. It suggests that Roger should express his concerns firmly to his boss, seek further clarification on the firm's protocol in handling such situations, and ask for guidance on handling similar requests in the future to avoid conflicts of interest.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific actions for Roger to take. For instance, he could ask for a clear explanation from Bill Mason regarding the firm's policies on sharing draft reports with external parties and request that any future requests for early access to reports be documented and approved through proper channels. Additionally, Roger should inquire about the consequences of sharing such information prematurely to ensure he fully understands the potential risks involved.

Overall, the answer is a good starting point but could benefit from more actionable and specific steps for Roger to take in addressing the ethical concerns raised in the scenario.
