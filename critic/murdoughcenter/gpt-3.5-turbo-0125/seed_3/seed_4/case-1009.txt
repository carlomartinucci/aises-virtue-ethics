The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it emphasizes open communication, professionalism, and a willingness to learn from the experience. By expressing disappointment, reminding the developer of the effort invested, seeking feedback, and maintaining a positive attitude towards future collaboration, the responder handles the situation with integrity and grace.

However, the answer could benefit from a more assertive stance in protecting the firm's interests. While remaining polite and professional, the responder could have also inquired about the specifics of the competitor's proposal to ensure fairness and transparency in the decision-making process. Additionally, it would have been prudent to discuss compensation for the work already completed in the proposal, to avoid potential exploitation of the firm's expertise.

Overall, the answer demonstrates ethical behavior by focusing on constructive communication and maintaining a positive relationship with the developer. To enhance the response, the responder should consider being more assertive in protecting the firm's interests and ensuring fair treatment in the business dealings.
