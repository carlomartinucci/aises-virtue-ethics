The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it aims to bring relevant information to light that may impact the objectivity and credibility of the engineering consultant and expert witness, Clyde Cleghorn. By documenting the discreetly gathered information about Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert's relationship and informing Fulton Adams, the consultant is making an effort to ensure that the legal proceedings are based on all available facts.

However, one potential downside to this approach is the potential for this information to be seen as a personal attack on Cleghorn rather than a genuine concern for the integrity of the legal process. There is a risk that raising issues about Cleghorn's personal life could be perceived as an attempt to discredit him rather than a legitimate inquiry into his objectivity.

To improve the ethical evaluation, the consultant could also consider discussing the situation with a legal ethics expert to ensure that the information is handled appropriately and in a manner consistent with legal and ethical standards. This additional step would demonstrate a commitment to upholding the integrity of the legal process while seeking guidance on how best to address the situation without crossing any ethical boundaries.
