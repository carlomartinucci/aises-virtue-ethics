The answer provided is ethical in that it emphasizes the importance of transparency, confronting the issue directly, and seeking advice from legal counsel. By encouraging Daulton to address the situation openly and honestly, it promotes integrity and accountability in dealing with conflicts of interest. The suggestion to involve all relevant parties and ensure a full disclosure is a proactive step towards resolving the ethical dilemma.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how Daulton should document the situation, communicate with Elias and Shellie, and handle any potential fallout from the disclosure. Additionally, outlining the potential consequences of not addressing the conflict of interest more explicitly could help Daulton understand the gravity of the situation and the risks involved in trying to cover up the ownership interest. Overall, the answer is sound but could benefit from more detailed actionable steps for Daulton to follow in addressing the ethical issue.
