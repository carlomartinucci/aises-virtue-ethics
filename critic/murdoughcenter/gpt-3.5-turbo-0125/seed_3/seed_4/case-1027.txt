The answer provided is ethical as it promotes transparency and honesty in dealing with the client, Bill Broot. By clearly communicating the cost estimate for the new project and explaining how the reuse of existing resources can lower the overall cost, it shows a commitment to fair and open business practices.

However, there are some areas for improvement. Firstly, the response could have addressed the issue of the budget overrun on the Dawson project more directly. It would have been beneficial to acknowledge the mistake and discuss how to prevent similar situations in the future to ensure financial stability for the firm.

Furthermore, while emphasizing the importance of staying within budget constraints is commendable, it would have been beneficial to also discuss potential renegotiation of the contract for the Dawson project to cover the additional costs incurred. This proactive approach could help in resolving the financial impact of the overrun and prevent similar issues in the future.

In conclusion, while the decision to be transparent with Bill Broot is ethical and commendable, addressing the budget overrun issue and exploring options for renegotiation could further enhance the response's practicality and effectiveness in managing the firm's financial health.
