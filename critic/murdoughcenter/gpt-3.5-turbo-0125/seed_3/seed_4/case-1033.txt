The answer provided is clear and actionable. It correctly advises Dianne to prioritize integrity, adhere to State DOT policy, and not deviate from the standard procedures. The emphasis on acting ethically and professionally is commendable, as it underscores the importance of following rules and regulations set by the department. Additionally, the recommendation to prioritize the interests of the State DOT and the citizens of Shadyvale over personal considerations is a sound ethical stance.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how Dianne can handle the situation practically. Suggestions such as seeking guidance from a supervisor or ethics committee within the department, documenting any concerns raised, or discussing the issue with Warren directly while maintaining professionalism could enhance the practicality of the advice given. Overall, the answer provides a good foundation but could benefit from additional detail on actionable steps for Dianne to navigate the ethical dilemma effectively.
