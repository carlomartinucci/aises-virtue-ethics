The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of taking immediate action to address the potential environmental risks posed by the situation. By gathering all relevant documentation, securing the samples, and reporting the incident to senior management, the answer recognizes the need for transparency and accountability in handling such a serious matter. Additionally, involving the management team ensures that the proper authorities are informed and that the hazardous waste is dealt with appropriately.

However, to improve the response further, it could have included a suggestion to document the conversation with the former co-workers about the drums being falsely claimed as clean. This additional step would provide further evidence to support Shariq's case when reporting the incident to the management team. Additionally, outlining the importance of following up with the management team to ensure that appropriate actions are taken would have added more clarity to the actionable steps to be taken.

Overall, the response is specific, practical, and actionable, highlighting the necessary steps Shariq should take to address the ethical dilemma effectively.
