The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it addresses the potential conflicts of interest and takes action to raise concerns with the appropriate university authorities. By gathering information, scheduling a meeting with the Vice President for Finance, and informing the University President, the architect is demonstrating a commitment to transparency and ethical practices in the construction projects at the university.

However, the answer could be improved by being more proactive in suggesting concrete steps to ensure transparency and fair competition in future contracts. For example, the architect could recommend implementing stricter oversight or review processes for awarding contracts, advocating for a competitive bidding process, or suggesting the creation of an ethics committee to monitor such situations.

Furthermore, the architect could consider discussing the issue with other reputable architects or firms in the community to gather additional perspectives and support for addressing the conflicts of interest.

Overall, while the initial actions proposed are commendable, the answer could benefit from additional specific recommendations to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future and to strengthen ethical standards within the university's construction projects.
