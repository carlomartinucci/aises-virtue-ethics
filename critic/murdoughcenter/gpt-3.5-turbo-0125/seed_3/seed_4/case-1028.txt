However, one area for improvement could be to proactively communicate with clients about the billing process for reimbursable expenses, including the rationale for billing at actual cost. This can help manage client expectations and prevent any misunderstandings or concerns regarding billing practices. Additionally, it may be beneficial to explore alternative ways to streamline the billing process for long-distance telephone charges without compromising transparency, such as implementing efficient tracking and reporting mechanisms.
