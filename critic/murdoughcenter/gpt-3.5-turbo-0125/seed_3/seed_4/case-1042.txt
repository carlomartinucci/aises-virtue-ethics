However, there are some shortcomings in the response. The answer could be further improved by highlighting the importance of communication with the building inspector, Janis, to ensure that all parties involved are aware of the potential problem. Additionally, it would be beneficial for Rashid to seek guidance from a more experienced colleague or mentor within the company to navigate the situation effectively.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for Rashid to address the issue ethically and professionally. By incorporating additional steps for communication and seeking guidance, Rashid can enhance his approach and ensure that the matter is handled effectively while upholding ethical standards in the construction project.
