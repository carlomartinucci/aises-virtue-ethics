The answer provided is mostly ethical as it focuses on advising Turnbuckle to gather all relevant documentation, prepare a detailed response to the board, emphasize his experience and expertise, provide evidence of the urgency of the situation, seek legal counsel, and cooperate with the investigation. This response is practical and actionable, providing specific steps for Turnbuckle to follow in response to the complaint.

However, it could have been improved by also mentioning that Turnbuckle should acknowledge any oversight on his part for not obtaining a license in the state before practicing engineering work. Taking responsibility for this oversight could show integrity and a commitment to upholding professional standards. Additionally, recommending that Turnbuckle proactively take steps to rectify this situation by obtaining the necessary license in the state for any future work would have further strengthened the ethical evaluation.

Overall, the response provides a clear course of action for Turnbuckle to address the complaint in a responsible and professional manner, but it could have included more emphasis on taking accountability for the licensing requirement.
