The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on transparency, honesty, and staying within budget constraints. By being upfront with Bill Broot about the cost estimate for the new project site and explaining how the reuse of information can lead to cost savings, it demonstrates integrity in the decision-making process.

However, there are some areas for improvement in the response. It would be beneficial to also address the issue of the budget overrun on the Dawson project and how it impacted the profitability significantly. By acknowledging this situation and discussing possible solutions or compromises with Bill Broot, it would show a proactive approach to resolving past issues and building a stronger working relationship moving forward.

Overall, the answer provided is ethical in terms of transparency and honesty, but it could be strengthened by addressing the past budget overrun and proposing ways to mitigate such risks in the future.
