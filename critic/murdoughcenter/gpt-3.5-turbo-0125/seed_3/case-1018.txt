The answer provided is a practical and specific course of action to address the issue of academic dishonesty in a fair and systematic manner. Gathering evidence, scheduling individual meetings with the students, confronting them with the evidence, and giving them a chance to explain themselves are all appropriate steps to take. The emphasis on integrity and consequences of academic dishonesty is commendable.

However, the answer could be improved by including more details on the specific penalties for academic dishonesty that would be applied if the students are found guilty. It would also be beneficial to mention seeking guidance from university policies or academic integrity resources to ensure consistency in handling such cases.

Overall, the response is a good starting point for addressing the situation, but could be enhanced by providing more clarity on the consequences for academic dishonesty and seeking additional support from university resources.
