The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes expressing disappointment, seeking feedback for improvement, and maintaining a professional demeanor. It acknowledges the effort put into preparing the proposal and cost estimate while also showing a willingness to learn from the situation and collaborate in the future. This approach demonstrates integrity and a commitment to maintaining a positive relationship with the client despite the outcome.

To improve, the response could have included a more assertive stance in negotiating for fair compensation for the work done in preparing the proposal. It could have also suggested setting clearer boundaries or terms for future proposals to avoid similar situations where detailed work is used without compensation. Additionally, proposing a follow-up meeting to discuss the decision further and clarify expectations could have been beneficial in ensuring transparency and understanding between both parties.

Overall, the answer is practical and actionable, focusing on constructive communication and relationship-building while leaving room for improvement in terms of asserting value and setting clearer expectations in future interactions.
