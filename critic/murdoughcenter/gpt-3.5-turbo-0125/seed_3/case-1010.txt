The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the safety of the building occupants and pedestrians over potential business relationships. By advising Julie to consult with other structural engineers in her firm to verify the accuracy of Brock's findings and to present these findings to Charles Smith with a recommendation for immediate action, the answer promotes transparency and accountability.

This would help Julie make informed decisions while balancing ethical considerations with legal implications.
