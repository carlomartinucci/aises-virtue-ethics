The answer provided is ethical as it promotes transparency and addresses the conflict of interest issue. By advocating for open communication and disclosure, Daulton is taking responsibility for ensuring ethical behavior in the project. This approach demonstrates a commitment to integrity and fairness in dealing with the situation. Additionally, the suggestion to seek legal advice shows a proactive effort to handle the issue appropriately and in accordance with legal standards.

However, the answer could benefit from more specific actions that Daulton should take in confronting Elias and Shellie. For example, outlining a step-by-step plan for the conversation and follow-up actions would enhance the practicality of the response. Furthermore, considering potential consequences and mitigation strategies for the project's progression would add depth to the evaluation. Overall, while the answer is commendable for its ethical stance, providing more detailed guidance on how Daulton should navigate the situation would make it even more robust and actionable.
