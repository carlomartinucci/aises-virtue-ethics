The answer provided is generally good as it acknowledges the ethical concerns raised in the scenario and suggests a course of action for Roger. By advising Roger to express his concerns more firmly to his boss and seek further clarification on the firm's practices regarding sharing draft reports, it encourages open communication and a focus on transparency and integrity. It also correctly recommends seeking guidance on handling similar situations in the future to prevent conflicts of interest.

However, the answer could be improved by including more specific steps for Roger to take. For example, it could suggest that Roger request a meeting with both Bill Mason and Frank Bullock to discuss the situation and clarify expectations moving forward. Additionally, it could advise Roger to document his concerns and any decisions made to protect himself and ensure accountability within the firm. These specific actions would provide Roger with a clearer roadmap for addressing the ethical dilemma he is facing.
