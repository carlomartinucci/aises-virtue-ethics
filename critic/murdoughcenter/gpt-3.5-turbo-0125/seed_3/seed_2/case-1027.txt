The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes transparency, honesty, and staying within budget constraints when communicating with the client. By clearly explaining the cost estimate for the new project site and highlighting the cost-saving measures taken through the reuse of existing resources, the response demonstrates a commitment to ethical business practices.

However, one area of improvement could be to address the issue of the overrun budget on the Dawson project more directly. It would be beneficial to acknowledge the mistake made in exceeding the budget and discuss potential solutions or adjustments to prevent similar occurrences in the future. This proactive approach would not only show accountability but also help in building trust with the client by demonstrating a commitment to rectifying past errors.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for ethical decision-making by prioritizing transparency, cost-effectiveness, and open communication with the client. By incorporating a discussion on addressing past mistakes, the response could further enhance its ethical considerations.
