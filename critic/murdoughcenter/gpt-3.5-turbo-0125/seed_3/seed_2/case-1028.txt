The answer provided is ethical as it promotes transparency and integrity in billing practices. By choosing not to take advantage of the option to add an internal markup to the long-distance telephone charges billed to clients, the individual is adhering to industry norms and client expectations. This decision helps maintain trust and credibility in client relationships, which is crucial for long-term success in consulting services. It also avoids potential conflicts of interest that could arise from profiting off such expenses.

However, a potential drawback of this approach is that it may lead to a loss of revenue for the consulting firm since they are not passing on the full cost of overhead expenses associated with long-distance calls to clients. It is important for the firm to carefully consider the financial implications of this decision and ensure that it does not negatively impact its sustainability.

In conclusion, while the decision to bill clients for long-distance telephone charges at actual cost without an internal markup is commendable for its ethical considerations, the firm should also evaluate the financial impact to ensure it remains viable in the long run.
