The answer provided is specific, practical, and actionable. It outlines a clear step-by-step plan of action, starting with gathering documentation, consulting with the legal team, and then addressing the issue with Moover Design Consultants directly. The response emphasizes the importance of understanding contractual rights, seeking clarification on project status, and setting expectations for communication and collaboration moving forward. It also suggests potential escalation paths if the initial efforts do not lead to a satisfactory resolution.

One area for improvement could be to include a contingency plan in case Moover Design Consultants are uncooperative or if legal action is necessary. Additionally, outlining specific consequences or next steps if the issue persists despite attempts at resolution could strengthen the response.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for addressing the situation effectively and protecting the firm's interests in a professional and proactive manner.
