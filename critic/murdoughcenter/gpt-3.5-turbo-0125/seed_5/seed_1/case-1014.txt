The answer provided is generally ethical as it emphasizes the importance of documenting concerns, seeking clarification on firm policies, and considering seeking guidance on ethical practices. By documenting his uneasiness and seeking clarification from his boss, Roger is taking proactive steps to address the situation. Additionally, the suggestion to understand the firm's policies and seek guidance from professional organizations shows a commitment to upholding ethical standards.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific actions for Roger to take. For example, he could request a meeting with both Frank and Bill to discuss his concerns directly, rather than solely relying on written communication. Additionally, he could propose specific solutions or alternatives to ensure the protection of sensitive project information in the future, such as implementing stricter controls on who has access to draft reports.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for Roger to address the current situation and prevent similar issues in the future, but it could benefit from more specific and actionable steps to enhance its effectiveness.
