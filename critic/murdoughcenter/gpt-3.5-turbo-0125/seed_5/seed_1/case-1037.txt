The answer provided is ethical as it addresses a potential conflict of interest in a professional setting. By documenting and reporting the observed interactions between Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert, the consultant is taking a proactive step to ensure transparency and fairness in the legal proceedings. Bringing this information to the attention of Fulton Adams highlights the importance of maintaining ethical standards and avoiding any biases that could impact the outcome of the case.

However, the response could be improved by emphasizing the need for full disclosure of the observed interactions to all relevant parties involved in the case, including the court. This would ensure that the potential conflict of interest is properly addressed and that the credibility of Cleghorn as an expert witness is thoroughly evaluated. Additionally, a recommendation to seek guidance from legal counsel on how to proceed with this information would further strengthen the consultant's ethical stance in handling the situation.
