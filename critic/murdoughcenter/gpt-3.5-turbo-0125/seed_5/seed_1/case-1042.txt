The suggested course of action for Rashid is comprehensive and ethical. Documenting observations, scheduling a meeting with Riley to present concerns, and prioritizing public safety are all commendable actions. By addressing the issue systematically and advocating for quality and compliance, Rashid demonstrates a commitment to professional integrity and ethical responsibility.

However, the plan could benefit from a few improvements. Rashid should ensure that his documented findings are detailed and precise, providing clear evidence of the problem to strengthen his case during the meeting with Riley. Additionally, he should be prepared to propose potential solutions or alternatives to address the coating issue without significantly delaying the project.

Furthermore, if Riley remains dismissive of the concerns raised by Rashid, it would be advisable for Rashid to seek support from other senior members of the company or relevant regulatory authorities sooner rather than later. Waiting too long to escalate the issue could potentially compromise public safety and project quality.

Overall, Rashid's proposed actions are ethical and demonstrate a commitment to upholding professional standards. By refining his approach and being prepared to escalate the matter if necessary, Rashid can effectively address the coating issue while ensuring public safety and project quality are not compromised.
