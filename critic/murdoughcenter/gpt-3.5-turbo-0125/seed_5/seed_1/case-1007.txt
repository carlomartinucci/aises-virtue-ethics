The answer provided is ethical as it involves gathering information, verifying facts, and taking proactive steps to address potential ethical issues. By suggesting a meeting with the Vice President for Finance, offering assistance, and briefing the University President, the architect is demonstrating a commitment to transparency and integrity in handling the situation.

Positively, the architect shows a willingness to investigate and address potential conflicts of interest, emphasizing the importance of ethical standards in university projects. By involving key stakeholders and offering assistance, the architect aims to uphold the university's reputation and ensure fairness in construction projects.

However, it would be beneficial for the architect to also consider seeking advice from a legal or ethics expert to ensure the proper handling of the situation. Additionally, outlining specific steps for monitoring and enforcing ethical practices in future projects would enhance the actionable nature of the response.
