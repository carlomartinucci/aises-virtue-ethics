The answer provided is commendable for emphasizing the importance of safety and regulatory compliance in the scenario. Conducting a thorough inspection of the existing treatment room and involving a qualified expert if needed are practical steps to ensure the facility meets the requirements for being explosion proof. This proactive approach demonstrates a commitment to ethical standards and the well-being of individuals involved in the project.

However, the answer could be strengthened by addressing potential consequences more directly. It would be beneficial to acknowledge the possible negative outcomes, such as project delays, increased costs, and frustration from stakeholders, that may result from further investigation. By acknowledging these risks, Reilly can better prepare for potential challenges and develop a strategy to address them effectively.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and actionable plan for Reilly to follow, but could benefit from a more explicit recognition of the potential downsides of pursuing further inquiries into the room's compliance with the NFPA 820 code.
