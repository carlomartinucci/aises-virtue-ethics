The suggested course of action for Reilly is overall ethical as it prioritizes safety and regulatory compliance, which are crucial aspects when dealing with a wastewater treatment plant. Conducting a thorough inspection of the existing treatment room to verify its compliance with NFPA 820 is a responsible step to take. Bringing in a qualified expert if needed shows a commitment to ensuring that the facility meets the necessary safety standards.

However, there are some potential downsides to consider. Raising concerns about the room's compliance could indeed lead to project delays and additional costs, which may not be well-received by the client or the project manager. Reilly will need to navigate these challenges carefully to balance the need for safety with the practical considerations of the project's timeline and budget.

In conclusion, while the proposed actions are ethically sound and focused on safety, Reilly should be prepared to address any potential consequences of raising concerns about the room's compliance with the code in a diplomatic and proactive manner. It is essential to communicate effectively with all stakeholders involved to ensure that the project moves forward in a safe and compliant manner.
