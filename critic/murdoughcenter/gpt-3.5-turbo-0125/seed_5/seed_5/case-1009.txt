The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on addressing the situation with honesty and integrity. By expressing disappointment to Mr. Young and clarifying the terms of the initial agreement, the individual is standing up for their firm's professionalism and ensuring that the full scope of work is considered. Requesting a meeting to negotiate a resolution and emphasizing the importance of completing the entire foundation investigation shows a commitment to upholding standards and ensuring the project's success.

However, a more actionable approach could involve setting a clear deadline for reaching a resolution with Mr. Young to prevent further delays. Additionally, outlining the potential consequences of splitting the work between firms more explicitly could help Mr. Young understand the risks involved. Providing specific options for moving forward, such as revising the agreement or renegotiating the terms, would also enhance the practicality of the response.
