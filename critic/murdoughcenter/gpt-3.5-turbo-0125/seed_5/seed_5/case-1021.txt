The answer provided is fair and practical. It emphasizes the importance of gathering relevant information, reviewing the company's code of conduct and laws, and conducting a due diligence process on International Affiliates. The suggestion to schedule a meeting with senior management to discuss the risks and benefits, explore alternative options, and make an informed decision aligns with ethical considerations and the need for thorough evaluation.

However, the response could be enhanced by providing more specific steps on how to conduct due diligence on International Affiliates, such as verifying their credentials, past work, and reputation. Additionally, outlining a plan for assessing the potential risks and benefits in a structured manner would further strengthen the response. Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for making a well-informed decision in this complex situation.
