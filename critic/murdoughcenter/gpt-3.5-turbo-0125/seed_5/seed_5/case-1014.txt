The answer provided is a good starting point in addressing the ethical dilemma faced by Roger. It correctly advises Roger to document his concerns and seek clarification from his boss regarding the firm's policies. This proactive approach is commendable as it helps Roger protect himself and potentially prevent any unethical behavior.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how Roger should handle the situation if his concerns are not adequately addressed by his boss or if he feels pressured to compromise his ethical standards. It would be beneficial to suggest that Roger may need to escalate the issue within the firm or consider seeking advice from an external ethics committee.

Additionally, while the recommendation to seek guidance from a professional engineering organization is valuable, it would be more actionable to advise Roger to familiarize himself with the relevant codes of ethics and standards of practice that apply to his profession. This would enable him to make more informed decisions in similar situations in the future.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for Roger to address the ethical dilemma he faces, but could benefit from more specific and actionable steps to ensure he handles the situation ethically and effectively.
