The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes transparency and integrity in billing practices, aligning with the clients' preference for passing on expenses at actual cost without added markup. By maintaining this approach, the consultant can uphold trust and credibility in their client relationships, demonstrating a commitment to fair and honest business practices.

The decision not to sign up for the plan offered by Creative Communications Corporation (CCC) is a commendable choice that values client satisfaction and honesty in financial transactions. By choosing to bill clients at actual cost, the consultant avoids potential conflicts of interest that may arise from adding internal markups on expenses, ensuring clear communication and trust with clients.

However, one potential drawback of this decision is the missed opportunity to potentially increase revenue by utilizing CCC's service to add internal markups on long distance telephone charges. While the ethical choice is to bill clients at actual cost, it is important to consider the financial implications of not taking advantage of a service that could potentially generate additional income for the firm.

To enhance this ethical decision further, the consultant could proactively communicate with clients about the billing process for out-of-pocket expenses, explaining their commitment to transparency and fairness in financial transactions. By openly discussing billing practices with clients and seeking their input, the consultant can strengthen client relationships and build a reputation for ethical business conduct.
