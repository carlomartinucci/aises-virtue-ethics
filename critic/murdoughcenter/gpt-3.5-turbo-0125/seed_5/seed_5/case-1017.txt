The answer provided is ethical as it recommends a course of action that aligns with principles of honesty, transparency, and integrity. By suggesting Bert gather evidence, schedule a meeting with a supervisor, and propose an investigation, the answer promotes accountability and ethical behavior in addressing the issue of potential intellectual property infringement.

However, one area for improvement could be to advise Bert to also consider consulting legal counsel or an ethics advisor to ensure he fully understands his rights and obligations in this situation. This additional step would provide Bert with a comprehensive view of the potential legal implications of the unauthorized use of intellectual property and help him navigate the situation more effectively.

Overall, the answer offers a practical and actionable solution to a complex ethical dilemma, emphasizing the importance of addressing the issue with thoroughness and professionalism.
