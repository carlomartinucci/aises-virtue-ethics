The answer provided is fairly ethical in that it suggests Roger should document his concerns, communicate with his boss, and seek clarification on the firm's policies. By doing so, Roger is taking steps to address the potential ethical issue at hand and protect the integrity of the project.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting more proactive steps for Roger to take. For instance, Roger could request a meeting with both Frank Bullock and Bill Mason to discuss the situation openly and seek a clear understanding of how the draft report will be used. This direct approach could help Roger address his concerns more effectively and ensure that the information is handled appropriately.

Additionally, the answer could emphasize the importance of upholding client confidentiality and avoiding conflicts of interest in consulting engineering projects. Roger should be encouraged to prioritize the integrity of the project and consider seeking advice from professional ethical guidelines or mentors in the field to navigate such situations in the future.
