The answer provided is ethical as it demonstrates transparency and honesty in dealing with the client regarding the cost estimate for the new project. By informing Bill Broot of the reduced cost based on the reuse of existing information from the Dawson site, the response shows a commitment to fair and clear communication.

On the positive side, the answer promotes openness and integrity in business dealings, maintaining a professional and ethical standard. By explaining the rationale behind the adjusted estimate, it ensures that the client is aware of how the cost was determined and fosters trust in the working relationship.

However, one aspect that could be improved upon is addressing the issue of the budget overrun on the Dawson project. While the response acknowledges the loss suffered on that project, it could have included a plan or proposal to rectify the situation, such as discussing options for covering the additional costs incurred.

Overall, the answer is specific, practical, and actionable in terms of handling the cost estimate for the new project while emphasizing transparency and clear communication. To enhance the ethical approach further, it could include a proactive solution for managing the budget overrun on the previous project.
