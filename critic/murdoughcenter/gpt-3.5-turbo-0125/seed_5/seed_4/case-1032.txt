The answer given is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being of the impacted community and suggests a practical course of action to address the concerns raised. By advising Topher to schedule a meeting with the design engineers and express his worries about the potential adverse impacts of the Windsor Ridge development, the answer promotes proactive engagement and consideration for all stakeholders involved. Additionally, the suggestion to explore alternative design options and incorporate additional measures to mitigate the impacts demonstrates a commitment to finding a balanced solution that aligns with ethical principles.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific details on the alternative design options that could be explored and the potential measures that could be implemented to address the concerns raised. By offering concrete suggestions for how Topher and the design team could work together to achieve a more socially responsible and sustainable outcome, the answer would be even more actionable and effective in guiding ethical decision-making.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario, but it could benefit from further elaboration on specific strategies and actions that Topher could take to navigate the situation ethically and responsibly.
