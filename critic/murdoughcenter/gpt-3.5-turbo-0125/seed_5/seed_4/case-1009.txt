The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of upholding the initial agreement and ensuring the project's success. By expressing disappointment to Mr. Young, clarifying the terms of the agreement, and requesting a meeting to negotiate a resolution, the individual is taking proactive steps to address the situation.

The good in this response is that it prioritizes clear communication, integrity, and the quality of work to be delivered, which are essential in maintaining professionalism and trust in business relationships. By seeking a resolution that upholds the integrity of the initial proposal and highlights the risks of splitting the work, the individual is advocating for the best interests of the project.

However, a potential improvement could be to include a clause in future proposals that explicitly states the terms of payment and work delivery to avoid misunderstandings like the one experienced with Mr. Young. This would provide added clarity and protection for both parties involved in similar situations.

Overall, the response effectively addresses the ethical concerns of the scenario by advocating for a fair and transparent resolution while emphasizing the importance of upholding agreements and delivering quality work.
