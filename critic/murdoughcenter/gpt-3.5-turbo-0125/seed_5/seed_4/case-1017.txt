The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it encourages Bert to gather evidence, express his concerns, and suggest conducting an investigation into the potential unauthorized use of intellectual property. By taking these steps, Bert is aiming to address the issue transparently and with integrity.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how Bert should navigate the delicate situation. For instance, it would be beneficial to suggest that Bert should approach the conversation with his supervisor or higher authority in a professional and non-accusatory manner. He should also be prepared to offer solutions or recommendations for resolving the issue, such as providing suggestions on how to rectify the situation with County Line Design if unauthorized use is confirmed.

Furthermore, the answer could emphasize the importance of documenting all conversations and actions taken regarding the matter to protect himself and ensure a thorough investigation is conducted. This would help Bert in case further actions need to be taken to address the situation.

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for Bert to address the potential ethical concern, but it could be enhanced by providing more specific steps for Bert to follow in handling the situation effectively and professionally.
