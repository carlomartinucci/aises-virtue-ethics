The answer provided is generally good as it emphasizes the importance of documenting observations, scheduling a meeting with the supervisor, and prioritizing public safety and quality standards. By documenting the issue and presenting it clearly to the supervisor, Rashid is taking a proactive approach to address the problem. Additionally, the suggestion to escalate the matter if the supervisor continues to dismiss the issue demonstrates a commitment to upholding ethical standards.

However, the answer could be improved by advising Rashid to seek guidance from a mentor or HR representative within the company before escalating the issue externally. This could help Rashid navigate the situation effectively and ensure that he follows the appropriate channels for reporting concerns. Additionally, providing specific steps or strategies for addressing potential backlash from superiors would make the response more actionable.

Overall, the answer is ethical as it encourages Rashid to prioritize public safety and quality standards, but it could benefit from more specific guidance on seeking internal support and managing potential conflicts with superiors.
