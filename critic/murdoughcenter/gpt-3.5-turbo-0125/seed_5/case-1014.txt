The answer provided is ethical to a certain extent. It correctly advises Roger to document his concerns about the situation, seek clarification on the firm's policies, and consider seeking guidance on ethical practices. These actions are practical and actionable steps that Roger can take to address the issue at hand.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting more assertive actions. For instance, Roger could directly confront Frank Bullock about the inappropriate request for the draft report and express his refusal to share such sensitive information without proper authorization. Additionally, the answer could have emphasized the importance of upholding client confidentiality and avoiding potential conflicts of interest.

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for Roger to address the ethical dilemma he is facing, but it could be strengthened by recommending more assertive actions to protect the integrity of the project and the firm's reputation.
