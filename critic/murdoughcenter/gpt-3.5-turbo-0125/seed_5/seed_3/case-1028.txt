The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes transparency and aligns with clients' preferences for passing on expenses at actual cost without any added markup. By maintaining this practice, the individual can uphold trust and integrity in client relationships, which is commendable. Additionally, the decision not to sign up for the plan offered by CCC demonstrates a commitment to ethical billing practices and a focus on client satisfaction.

However, one potential downside is that by not utilizing the internal markup option, the individual may be missing out on an opportunity to potentially recoup some of the overhead costs associated with long-distance telephone charges. While it is important to respect clients' wishes, it is also crucial to ensure that the business remains financially sustainable. Therefore, a more balanced approach could involve exploring options for cost recovery while still being transparent with clients about billing practices.

In summary, the decision to continue billing clients at actual cost is ethical and promotes trust and integrity. However, it is essential to also consider the financial implications for the business and seek a balance between client preferences and business sustainability.
