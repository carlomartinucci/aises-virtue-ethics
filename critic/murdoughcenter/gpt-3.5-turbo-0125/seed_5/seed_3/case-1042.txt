The answer provided is specific and actionable, outlining steps for Rashid to take in addressing the beam coating issue. By suggesting that Rashid should document his observations, schedule a meeting with Riley, and potentially escalate the matter if needed, the answer offers a structured approach to dealing with the ethical dilemma at hand.

One positive aspect is the emphasis on documenting observations, which is essential in providing evidence to support Rashid's concerns. Additionally, the suggestion to schedule a meeting with Riley and present the documented findings shows a proactive approach in addressing the issue directly with the supervisor.

However, the answer could be improved by including more guidance on how Rashid can navigate potential conflicts with Riley, considering the supervisor's dismissive attitude towards the issue. Providing strategies for effective communication and conflict resolution in such situations would enhance the practicality of the response.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for Rashid to address the ethical dilemma, but could benefit from additional insights on handling potential resistance from superiors in a constructive manner.
