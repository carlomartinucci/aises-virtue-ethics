The answer provided is ethical as it involves transparent communication with the client about the cost estimate for the new project, taking into account the reuse of existing information to reduce the overall cost. By clearly explaining the rationale behind the adjusted estimate, the response demonstrates honesty and integrity in dealings with the client.

However, there are some potential concerns with this approach. While it is commendable to be transparent about the cost breakdown, there is a risk that by offering a significantly reduced estimate without discussing the full cost implications, the firm may be undervaluing its services and potentially setting a precedent for future projects. This could lead to further financial losses or strained profitability on projects if not carefully managed.

To improve the response, it would be advisable to also discuss with Bill Broot the financial constraints faced on the Dawson project and the need for mutual cooperation to ensure fair compensation for the services provided. This could involve renegotiating the terms of the Dawson project to cover the additional costs incurred, or discussing alternative solutions to ensure that the firm's work is adequately compensated in the future.

Overall, the answer is ethical in its transparency but could benefit from a more comprehensive discussion on financial considerations and long-term implications for the firm's profitability.
