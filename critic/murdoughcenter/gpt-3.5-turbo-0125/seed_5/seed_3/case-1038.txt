The suggested course of action for Daulton to confront Elias and Shellie about their undisclosed property ownership and rectify the situation transparently is commendable. By insisting on disclosure and transparency, Daulton is addressing the ethical issue head-on and taking steps to uphold integrity in business dealings. This action shows a commitment to ethical standards and corporate responsibility.

Furthermore, involving ClearWater's leadership and working with them to address the conflict of interest demonstrates a proactive approach to handling the situation and seeking guidance from higher authorities. This collaboration can help ensure that the issue is appropriately addressed and prevent any potential legal or ethical ramifications for the company.

However, the evaluation could be improved by suggesting specific steps for Daulton to take in terms of how to confront Elias and Shellie effectively, such as setting up a meeting to discuss the issue, documenting the conversation and any actions taken, and establishing clear guidelines for future interactions to prevent similar conflicts of interest.

Overall, the response provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma, but could benefit from more actionable and detailed steps for implementation.
