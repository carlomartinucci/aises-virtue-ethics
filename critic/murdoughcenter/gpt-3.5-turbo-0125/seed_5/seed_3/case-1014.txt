The answer provided is a good starting point for Roger to address the ethical concerns he is facing. It correctly advises Roger to document his concerns, seek clarification from his boss, and understand the firm's policies better. By doing so, Roger can protect himself and potentially prevent any unethical behavior from occurring.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting more proactive steps for Roger to take. For instance, he could request a meeting with the firm's ethics committee or HR department to discuss the situation further and seek guidance on how to proceed. Additionally, Roger could consider discussing the issue with his coworkers to gather different perspectives and potentially form a united front if necessary.

Overall, the answer is on the right track but could benefit from more actionable steps for Roger to take in order to fully address the ethical dilemma he is facing.
