The answer provided is ethical as it suggests a proactive approach to address the concerns about the potential adverse impacts of the Windsor Ridge development on the downstream community. By advising Topher to schedule a meeting with the design engineers, express his concerns, and explore alternative design options, the answer promotes responsible decision-making that considers the well-being of all stakeholders involved.

Positively, the answer emphasizes the importance of advocating for the impacted community and seeking ways to mitigate potential negative effects while still meeting necessary codes and regulations. This demonstrates a commitment to balancing economic progress with social responsibility.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting specific actions or measures that Topher could propose during the meeting with the design engineers to address the concerns effectively. Providing more detailed recommendations on potential solutions or modifications to the development plans would enhance the practicality and actionable nature of the response.

Overall, the answer offers a solid foundation for ethical decision-making by encouraging engagement with relevant parties and consideration of the broader impacts of the proposed development. By enhancing the specificity of the recommendations, the response could further strengthen its practicality and effectiveness in addressing the ethical dilemma at hand.
