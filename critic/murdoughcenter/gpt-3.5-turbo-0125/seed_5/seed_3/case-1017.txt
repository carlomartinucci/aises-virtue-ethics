The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of gathering evidence, presenting findings to higher authorities, and suggesting a thorough investigation into the situation. By taking these steps, Bert is demonstrating integrity and a commitment to addressing potential intellectual property issues.

On the positive side, the answer encourages Bert to act responsibly by collecting evidence and raising his concerns through the appropriate channels within the company. This approach promotes transparency and accountability, which are crucial in maintaining ethical standards in the workplace.

However, the answer could be improved by including specific actions Bert should take to protect both his interests and the interests of his former employer. For example, Bert should consider consulting legal counsel to understand his rights and obligations in this situation. Additionally, he could explore options for resolving the issue amicably with Far Horizons Engineering while safeguarding the intellectual property of County Line Design.

In summary, the answer provides a good foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma but could be enhanced by offering more specific steps for Bert to take in protecting intellectual property rights and navigating the situation with integrity.
