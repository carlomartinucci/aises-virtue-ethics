The answer provided is fair and specific in addressing the ethical dilemma faced by Carlos. The recommendation to prioritize the safety and well-being of the workers is commendable, as it emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations in decision-making. Advising Carlos to express his concerns to his boss, emphasize the need for additional safety measures, and potentially escalate the issue if necessary demonstrates a practical and actionable approach to addressing the situation.

However, one area for improvement could be to provide more specific guidance on how Carlos could navigate the potential consequences of his actions, such as the risk of losing his job or damaging his relationship with his boss. Offering advice on how to communicate effectively and negotiate for a compromise that ensures both the completion of the project and the safety of the workers would enhance the practicality of the response.

Overall, the answer effectively balances the ethical considerations with practical steps for Carlos to take in handling the dilemma, but expanding on the potential consequences and providing more detailed strategies for addressing them would further enhance the evaluation.
