The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of upholding academic integrity and following the university's policies on plagiarism. The action of scheduling individual meetings with the students to investigate the similarities in their reports is a proactive step in addressing the issue. By considering the students' explanations and consulting with other faculty members or advisors, the response demonstrates a fair and thorough approach to handling the situation.

However, the answer could be improved by specifying the exact steps to be taken if plagiarism is confirmed, such as reporting the incident to the appropriate authorities and applying the consequences outlined in the university's policies. Additionally, it would be beneficial to address the potential consequences for the students involved, such as academic penalties, and how to support them through the process while maintaining the integrity of the course and the university.

Overall, the response provides a solid foundation for addressing the plagiarism issue, but could benefit from more specific details on the actions to be taken in different scenarios and how to support both the students and the academic integrity of the institution effectively.
