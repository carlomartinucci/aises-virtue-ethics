The answer provided is practical and actionable, as it outlines specific steps for Reilly to take in order to address his concerns about the existing treatment room's compliance with the NFPA 820 code. By suggesting a thorough inspection of the room and recommending the involvement of a qualified expert if needed, the answer emphasizes the importance of prioritizing safety and regulatory compliance.

However, one potential improvement could be to also advise Reilly to document his findings and concerns throughout the process. Keeping a record of the inspection results, any discussions with Dante, and the involvement of any experts would help ensure transparency and accountability in case further actions or decisions need to be made.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and actionable course of action for Reilly to follow, balancing the need for thorough verification with the potential consequences of additional project delays and costs.
