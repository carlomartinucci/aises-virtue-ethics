The answers provided are specific and practical, offering a clear framework for determining fees in each scenario. In Question 1, the response appropriately considers the scope of the project, the value of the solution, the market rates, and the potential impact on reputation. This approach ensures a fair and competitive fee is set for the services provided to Zeller Construction.

In Question 2, the answer takes into account the value of past services provided to Hartwell, market conditions, and competition. By negotiating a fee that reflects the value of services while being fair and competitive, the response balances the interests of both parties effectively.

In Question 3, the decision to keep the fee determination process largely the same as in Question 2 is reasonable. Considering the impact of Hartwell not bidding on the project and potentially adjusting the fee based on the specific context shows a thoughtful approach to the situation.

Overall, the answers provide actionable steps for determining fees in a fair and ethical manner in each scenario. The consideration of value, market conditions, competition, and potential impacts on reputation and relationships demonstrates a well-rounded approach to fee negotiation.
