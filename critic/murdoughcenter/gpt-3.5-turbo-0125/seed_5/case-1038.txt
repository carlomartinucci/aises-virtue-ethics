The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of transparency, rectifying the situation, and upholding integrity in business dealings. By recommending that Daulton confront Elias and Shellie about their undisclosed ownership, disclose the information to relevant parties, and inform ClearWater's leadership, the answer promotes accountability and ethical behavior.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific steps for Daulton to take in addressing the conflict of interest. For instance, it could suggest involving legal counsel to ensure compliance with regulations, documenting all communications and actions taken, and implementing measures to prevent similar situations in the future. Additionally, the answer could have highlighted the potential consequences of not addressing the conflict of interest, such as damage to ClearWater's reputation and legal implications.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma but could benefit from more detailed and actionable steps to guide Daulton in handling the situation effectively.
