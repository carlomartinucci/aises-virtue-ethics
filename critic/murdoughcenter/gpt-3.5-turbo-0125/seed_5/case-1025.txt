The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it upholds the professional responsibility of the geotechnical engineering firm in advising the bank about obtaining permission for installing tiebacks on the adjacent property. By consulting with a lawyer, reviewing evidence, and rejecting the settlement offer, the firm is taking a principled stance in defending its actions.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on relying on evidence and documentation to support the firm's position. By standing firm on the fact that the responsibility for obtaining permission lay with the bank, the firm is demonstrating integrity and ethical conduct.

However, one area for improvement could be to proactively engage with the bank and other involved parties to clarify the situation and ensure that all parties understand the firm's position. This could help prevent misunderstandings and potential legal disputes in the future.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and actionable plan for addressing the situation ethically by relying on evidence, legal advice, and a principled defense of the firm's actions.
