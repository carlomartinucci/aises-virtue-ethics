The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of gathering evidence, presenting findings, expressing concerns, and suggesting a thorough investigation into the potential unauthorized use of intellectual property. By taking these steps, Bert is acting with integrity and transparency, seeking to address the issue in a professional manner.

However, the answer could be improved by including specific actions Bert should take after the meeting with his supervisor or higher authority. For example, Bert should follow up on the investigation progress, ensure that any unauthorized use is rectified, and advocate for proper credit or compensation to be given to County Line Design if their intellectual property was indeed used without permission. Additionally, Bert should consider discussing the situation with legal counsel to understand his rights and options in this matter.

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for Bert to address the situation ethically, but it could be enhanced by including more specific actions for Bert to take following the initial meeting with his superiors.
