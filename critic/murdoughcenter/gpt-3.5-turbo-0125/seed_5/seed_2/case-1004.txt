The answer provided is ethical as it addresses the potential conflict of interest between Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert due to their personal relationship. By documenting the observations and bringing this information to the attention of Fulton Adams, the attorney for Wastewater Treatment Systems, the consultant is taking the necessary steps to ensure transparency and integrity in the legal proceedings.

The consultant's action of suggesting a discussion with the legal team to determine the best course of action shows a proactive approach to addressing the situation before the trial begins. This helps to maintain the credibility of the case and upholds professional standards.

However, one area that could be improved upon is the specific recommendation for action. The consultant could have provided more specific guidance on how to handle the potential conflict of interest, such as recommending recusal or further investigation into the matter.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the ethical implications of the situation and offers a practical solution to address the conflict of interest.
