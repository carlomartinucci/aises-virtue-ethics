The answer provided is mostly ethical as it involves taking responsibility for the decision made regarding the pump specifications. By promptly returning the call and acknowledging the issues with the pumps, the firm is showing accountability for their actions. Additionally, the willingness to work with the city to find a solution and address any concerns demonstrates a commitment to resolving the situation.

However, the response could be improved by delving deeper into the reasons behind the decision to choose Pumpco over Excelsior, providing more transparency in the statement to the Elm Grove Gazette. It would be beneficial to explain the considerations that led to that choice, such as cost concerns or pressure from the city's project manager, to give a more comprehensive picture of the decision-making process. This additional context could help rebuild trust with the city and show a willingness to learn from the situation.

Overall, the response is ethical in its approach to handling the issue, but it could benefit from more detailed explanation and transparency to fully address the concerns raised by the pump failures.
