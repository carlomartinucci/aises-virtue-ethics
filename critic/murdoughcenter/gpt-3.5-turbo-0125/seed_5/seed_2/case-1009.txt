The answer provided is generally ethical as it focuses on expressing disappointment, clarifying the initial agreement, and negotiating a resolution with the developer. By emphasizing the importance of completing the entire foundation investigation and the risks of splitting the work, it seeks to uphold the integrity of the initial proposal and ensure the project's success.

However, the answer could be improved by being more proactive in protecting the firm's interests. One actionable step that could be added is to formally document the original agreement to provide evidence of the agreed-upon scope of work and pricing. This documentation can serve as a reference point during negotiations and help protect the firm's position in case of disputes.

Additionally, it would be beneficial to clearly outline the potential consequences of the developer's actions, such as the impact on project timelines, costs, and structural integrity. This can help Mr. Young understand the seriousness of the situation and the importance of honoring the initial agreement.

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma, but by including specific actions like formal documentation and outlining consequences, it can enhance the firm's ability to protect its interests and negotiate a fair resolution.
