The answer provided is ethical as it involves gathering information, verifying facts, and taking proactive steps to address potential unethical practices within the university's construction projects. By scheduling a meeting with the Vice President for Finance, the architect shows a commitment to transparency and integrity in bringing up the concerns raised by Alice, Ted, and his wife.

The architect's approach of offering assistance and emphasizing the importance of ethical standards in construction projects is commendable. By involving key university stakeholders, such as the Vice President for Finance and the University President, the architect shows a willingness to address the issue at a higher level and work towards ensuring future projects adhere to ethical standards.

However, the architect could improve the response by considering involving an independent ethics committee or compliance officer within the university to investigate the potential conflicts of interest thoroughly. This would add an extra layer of impartiality to the process and ensure a comprehensive review of all parties involved.

Overall, the architect's actions are a good starting point in addressing the ethical concerns raised and demonstrate a commitment to upholding integrity in the construction projects at the university.
