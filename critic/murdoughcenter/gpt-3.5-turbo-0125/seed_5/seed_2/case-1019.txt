Additionally, the answer could benefit from proposing a plan to address the situation if the president of the company does not take immediate action or provide clear guidance on how to proceed.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the ethical implications of the situation and takes a responsible approach by seeking guidance from higher management. To enhance its effectiveness, it could include more specific steps to gather evidence and propose a course of action in case the initial meeting does not lead to a resolution.
