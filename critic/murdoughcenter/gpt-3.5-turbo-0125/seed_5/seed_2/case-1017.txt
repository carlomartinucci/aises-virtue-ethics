The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it encourages Bert to gather evidence, present his concerns, and suggest conducting an investigation into the potential unauthorized use of intellectual property. By advocating for transparency and integrity, the answer promotes ethical behavior in addressing the situation.

On the positive side, the answer emphasizes the importance of evidence gathering and presenting findings in a professional manner. It also suggests taking proactive steps to address the issue by involving higher authorities and advocating for a thorough investigation.

However, one aspect that could be improved upon is providing more specific guidance on how Bert should handle the situation if the unauthorized use of intellectual property is confirmed. The answer could incorporate suggestions on potential actions Bert could take to ensure that the issue is resolved appropriately and that steps are taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for Bert to address the ethical dilemma he faces. By expanding on the actionable steps Bert could take after the investigation, the response could be even more practical and effective in guiding Bert through the situation.
