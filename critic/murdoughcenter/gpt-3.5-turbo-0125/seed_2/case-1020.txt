The answer provided is specific and practical in addressing the situation at hand. By preparing thoroughly and gathering all relevant documents and evidence, the responder demonstrates a proactive approach to the issue. Additionally, the plan to present technical facts and evidence during the mediation hearing shows a commitment to upholding the integrity of their firm's work.

However, the response could benefit from a more assertive stance in asserting the firm's position of not bearing financial responsibility for the claim. While the responder mentions standing firm on this position, a clearer statement emphasizing the lack of obligation to contribute financially would strengthen their stance during the mediation process.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for handling the situation ethically by focusing on presenting technical evidence and maintaining professionalism. Strengthening the assertion of non-financial responsibility would further enhance the response's effectiveness in navigating the mediation process.
