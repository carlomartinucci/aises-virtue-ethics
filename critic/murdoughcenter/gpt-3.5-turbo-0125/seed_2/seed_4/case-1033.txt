The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of adhering to State DOT policy and prioritizing integrity in decision-making. By choosing to uphold the established guidelines and not compromising on ethical standards, Dianne is demonstrating a commitment to ethical behavior and accountability.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific steps for Dianne to take in this situation. For example, Dianne could document her concerns in writing and escalate the issue to a higher authority within the State DOT for guidance and support. Additionally, she could have a candid conversation with Warren to express her commitment to following the policy and seeking his understanding and cooperation in upholding ethical standards.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and ethical course of action for Dianne to follow, but could benefit from more actionable steps to address the dilemma effectively.
