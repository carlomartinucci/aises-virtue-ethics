The answer provided is specific and actionable, outlining steps for Ethan to address his concerns about the field changes authorized by Marc. The suggested approach of scheduling a meeting with Marc, providing specific examples, discussing consequences, and working collaboratively to find a resolution is practical and clear.

The recommendation to emphasize the importance of maintaining trust with the client, document decisions, and ensure transparency within the partnership is commendable. By addressing the issue directly and seeking a resolution that upholds the quality standards agreed upon, Ethan can navigate the conflict effectively.

However, one potential improvement could be to advise Ethan to also involve EDOT in the discussion about the field changes, as their input and approval may be necessary given the impact on the project. This would further ensure transparency and alignment with the client's expectations.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for Ethan to address the issue with professionalism, integrity, and a focus on achieving a high-quality project outcome while maintaining trust with all stakeholders involved.
