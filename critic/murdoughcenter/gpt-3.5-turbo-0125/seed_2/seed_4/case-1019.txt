The answer provided is quite ethical and practical. It suggests documenting observations, discreetly gathering information, and seeking guidance from higher management to address the conflict of interest situation with Roy and Hotspark Electrical. By involving the president and potentially the human resources or legal department, the answer shows a clear intention to prioritize the firm's interests and project quality while handling the sensitive matter appropriately.

One improvement could be to include a step that involves having a candid conversation with Roy to address the observed behavior directly before escalating the issue further. This could potentially resolve the situation internally without the need for immediate involvement of higher management. Additionally, outlining a plan for monitoring and mitigating any potential negative impacts on ongoing projects resulting from the conflict of interest would enhance the actionability of the response.

Overall, the answer provides a solid ethical framework for dealing with the dilemma at hand, emphasizing the importance of transparency, integrity, and seeking support from appropriate channels within the organization to address the issue effectively.
