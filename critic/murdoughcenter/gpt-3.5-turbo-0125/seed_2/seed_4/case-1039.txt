The answer provided is indeed ethical. Shariq is faced with a situation where there is a clear discrepancy in the handling and disposal of potentially hazardous waste. By contacting his supervisor, Chuck Ashby, and informing him of the situation, Shariq is taking the right step in addressing the issue and ensuring proper protocols are followed.

The good in this response is that Shariq is prioritizing safety and regulatory compliance by raising the concern about the untested drums. By offering to provide the samples for testing and taking appropriate action based on the results, Shariq shows a commitment to ethical conduct and environmental responsibility.

However, one improvement could be to also suggest documenting the entire situation in writing, including the conversation with Chuck and any subsequent actions taken. This documentation could serve as a record of Shariq's actions and concerns, which may be valuable in the future if any questions or issues arise regarding this incident.

Overall, the response is specific, practical, and actionable in advising Shariq on the ethical course of action to take in this scenario.
