The answer provided is ethical as it maintains transparency with the client, Bill Broot, by clearly stating the cost estimate for the new project and justifying the reduced amount due to the reuse of existing information. This approach ensures that the client is aware of the factors influencing the pricing and allows for informed decision-making.

However, while the response is clear and straightforward, it could benefit from additional considerations.

Setting clear boundaries and managing client expectations can help maintain a healthy working relationship and prevent misunderstandings.

Overall, the response is ethical in terms of transparency and communication with the client. To enhance the ethical decision-making process further, it is recommended to incorporate discussions on financial planning and scope management for future projects.
