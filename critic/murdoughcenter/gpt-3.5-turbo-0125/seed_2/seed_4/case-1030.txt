The answer provided is ethical and practical. It emphasizes the importance of prioritizing safety and compliance with regulations over potential project delays or inconveniencing stakeholders. The suggestion for Reilly to conduct a thorough inspection of the existing treatment room to verify its explosion-proof status and to document any discrepancies found is a responsible course of action. Additionally, advising Reilly to report his findings to the project manager promptly shows a commitment to transparency and accountability.

One area for improvement could be to suggest that Reilly involve relevant experts or authorities, such as a fire safety inspector, in the inspection process to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the room's compliance with NFPA 820. This could strengthen the credibility of his findings and provide additional assurance that the safety requirements are being met.

Overall, the answer provides clear and actionable steps for Reilly to address his concerns effectively while upholding ethical standards and prioritizing safety.
