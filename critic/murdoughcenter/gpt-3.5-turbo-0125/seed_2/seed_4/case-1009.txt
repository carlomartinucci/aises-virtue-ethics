The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes open communication, professionalism, and seeking a fair resolution to the situation. By expressing disappointment and reminding the developer of the value your firm can bring to the project, you are advocating for your firm's interests in a respectful manner. Additionally, suggesting a renegotiation of the agreement and highlighting the expertise of your firm shows a proactive approach to potentially salvage the business relationship.

However, the answer could be improved by being more assertive in ensuring that your firm is compensated for the work put into preparing the proposal. It would be beneficial to clearly state the expectation of being compensated for the intellectual property and effort invested in developing the detailed scope of work. Additionally, outlining specific terms for potential renegotiation and clearly defining boundaries for future engagements can help prevent similar situations in the future.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a good balance of advocating for your firm's interests while maintaining professionalism and leaving the door open for future collaborations. Enhancing assertiveness and clarity in communication would strengthen the response further.
