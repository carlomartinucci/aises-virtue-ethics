The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the safety and well-being of the workers, acknowledges the legal implications of the situation, and suggests practical steps for Carlos to take in order to address the issue. By documenting safety concerns, seeking legal advice, and escalating the matter if necessary, Carlos is taking appropriate actions to ensure that the workers are protected and that ethical standards are upheld.

However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the importance of open communication with the workers themselves. Carlos should involve the workers in the decision-making process and ensure that their voices are heard regarding their safety and well-being. Additionally, the answer could have suggested exploring alternative solutions that prioritize both the workers' safety and their job security, such as providing safety training for the Ecuadorian workers or finding a compromise that ensures their legal status while addressing safety concerns.

Overall, the answer provides a solid ethical framework for Carlos to navigate this challenging situation, but could benefit from a more comprehensive approach that includes direct communication with the workers and exploring creative solutions that address both safety and job security concerns.
