The answer provided is ethical as it suggests that Daulton should disclose the conflict of interest involving Elias and Shellie's joint venture owning property that stands to benefit from the construction of the new road. By informing his superiors at ClearWater Developers and seeking guidance, Daulton is taking a proactive step towards addressing the ethical dilemma transparently. Contacting legal counsel and potentially involving a third-party mediator or ethics committee further demonstrates a commitment to handling the situation responsibly.

However, the answer could be improved by including specific actions that Daulton should take to ensure accountability and prevent similar conflicts of interest in the future. For instance, Daulton could propose implementing stricter disclosure policies within the company or establishing independent oversight mechanisms to prevent such ethical lapses. Additionally, outlining the potential consequences of failing to address the conflict of interest more explicitly would help underscore the importance of taking decisive action.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma but would benefit from more actionable steps to strengthen the ethical framework within ClearWater Developers and prevent similar situations from arising in the future.
