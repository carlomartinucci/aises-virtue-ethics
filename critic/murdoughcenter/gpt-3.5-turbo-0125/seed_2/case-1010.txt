The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of prioritizing safety and structural integrity over business relationships. It suggests seeking a second opinion to verify the findings and then disclosing the critical information to the prospective buyers through proper channels. This approach aligns with ethical principles by ensuring transparency and accountability in the situation.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific steps for Julie to take, such as outlining a clear communication plan for disclosing the information to the buyers and emphasizing the potential legal and ethical implications of withholding such critical information. Additionally, it would be beneficial to address the potential consequences of not taking action, such as the risks associated with failing to disclose the structural issues.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for ethical decision-making but could benefit from more detailed and actionable steps for Julie to follow in handling the situation effectively.
