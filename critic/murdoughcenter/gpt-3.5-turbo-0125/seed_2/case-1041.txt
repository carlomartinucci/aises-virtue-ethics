The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the safety and well-being of the workers, which is commendable. By documenting safety concerns and seeking legal advice, Carlos is taking proactive steps to protect both the workers and himself. Additionally, the suggestion to escalate the issue to higher management or relevant authorities if necessary shows a commitment to ensuring a safe work environment.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how Carlos can effectively escalate his concerns within the company. It would be beneficial to outline potential strategies for approaching higher management or relevant authorities, such as preparing a detailed report or seeking support from colleagues who share his concerns. Additionally, the answer could emphasize the importance of maintaining open communication with the workers throughout the process to ensure their voices are heard and their rights are respected.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma at hand, but could benefit from more detailed and actionable steps for Carlos to take in navigating the situation effectively.
