The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the safety and well-being of the workers, which is commendable. By documenting safety concerns and seeking legal advice, Carlos is taking proactive steps to protect both himself and the workers. Additionally, the suggestion to escalate the issue if necessary shows a commitment to ensuring a safe working environment.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how Carlos can effectively escalate his concerns within the company. It would be beneficial to advise Carlos on how to navigate the potential conflict with his boss and offer strategies for advocating for the workers while also considering his own job security.

Overall, the answer is practical and actionable, but it could be enhanced by offering more detailed steps for Carlos to follow in addressing the situation within the company.
