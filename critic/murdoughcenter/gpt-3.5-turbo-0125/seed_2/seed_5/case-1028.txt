The answer provided is ethical as it aligns with the clients' expectations of being billed at actual cost without any mark-up for overhead expenses. By maintaining transparency in billing practices, it fosters trust and integrity in the client-consultant relationship. This approach also avoids potential conflicts of interest that may arise from adding mark-ups on expenses.

However, the answer could be improved by considering the potential financial impact on the consulting firm. While the ethical choice is to bill clients at actual cost, the firm may need to find alternative ways to cover the overhead expenses associated with these charges. It would be beneficial to explore cost-effective solutions or efficiencies within the firm's operations to offset these overhead costs without passing them on to the clients.

In summary, the answer demonstrates ethical behavior by prioritizing transparency and client preferences in billing practices. To enhance the response further, it would be prudent to consider the firm's financial sustainability and explore internal strategies to manage overhead costs effectively.
