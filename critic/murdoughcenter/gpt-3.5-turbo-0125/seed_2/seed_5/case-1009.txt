The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes communication, professionalism, and seeking a fair resolution to the situation. By expressing disappointment to Mr. Young and reminding him of the value your firm brings to the project, you are standing up for your work and attempting to rectify the situation in a diplomatic manner. Additionally, inquiring about the possibility of revisiting the agreement and negotiating terms shows a proactive approach to resolving the issue.

On the positive side, the response encourages open dialogue and attempts to salvage the business relationship by highlighting the firm's expertise. It also acknowledges the importance of learning from the experience to improve future interactions with clients.

However, one area for improvement could be to address the issue of the competitor's unethical behavior in agreeing to bill for only a portion of the work until the project is 80% occupied. This behavior could potentially lead to conflicts of interest and compromise the integrity of the project. It would be beneficial to address this aspect and possibly report the competitor's actions to relevant authorities to uphold ethical standards in the industry.

Overall, the response is practical and actionable, focusing on communication and negotiation skills while also recognizing the importance of learning from the experience.
