Your response provides clear and actionable steps for Roger to address the ethical dilemma he is facing. You correctly advise him to express his concerns more firmly to his boss, seek clarification on how the information will be handled, document instances of ethical discomfort, and seek advice from professional organizations or mentors.

One area for improvement could be to suggest that Roger also consider escalating the issue to higher management or the firm's ethics committee if his concerns are not adequately addressed at the initial level. This could provide additional support and guidance in handling such delicate situations.

Overall, your response is practical, specific, and provides a good framework for Roger to navigate the ethical challenges he is encountering. Well done.
