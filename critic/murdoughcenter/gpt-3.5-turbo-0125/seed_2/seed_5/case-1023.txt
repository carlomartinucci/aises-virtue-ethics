The answer provided is specific and actionable, outlining steps to document communications, request a meeting with Moover Design Consultants, express concerns, seek clarification, and consider legal advice if needed. These actions demonstrate a proactive approach to addressing the lack of communication and discrepancies in the project's progress.

One positive aspect of this response is the emphasis on documenting all interactions, which is crucial in maintaining a clear record of the situation. Additionally, requesting a meeting with Moover to address concerns directly shows a willingness to confront the issue head-on and seek resolution.

However, one area for improvement could be to include a more detailed plan for the potential outcomes of the meeting with Moover. For example, outlining specific questions to ask or discussing possible scenarios based on their responses could further enhance the preparedness for the meeting.

Overall, this response provides a solid framework for handling the situation ethically and professionally, but could benefit from additional detail in planning for the meeting with Moover.
