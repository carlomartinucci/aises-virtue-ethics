The answer provided is specific, practical, and actionable. It outlines a clear plan of action that involves gathering detailed information, discreetly reaching out to relevant university officials, and offering assistance in promoting ethical practices within the construction projects at the university. By addressing the potential conflicts of interest and expressing concerns directly to the appropriate authorities, the response demonstrates a proactive approach to upholding integrity and transparency.

However, one improvement could be to consider involving a third-party ethics committee or independent investigator to ensure an unbiased review of the situation and to add an additional layer of accountability. This would further strengthen the effort to address any potential misconduct and uphold ethical standards within the university's construction projects.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for addressing the ethical concerns raised in the scenario, and taking additional steps to involve external oversight would enhance the thoroughness and credibility of the response.
