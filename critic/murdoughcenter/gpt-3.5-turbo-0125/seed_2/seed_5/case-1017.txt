The answer provided is ethical overall as it emphasizes the importance of gathering evidence, presenting findings, and proposing a solution to address the potential intellectual property infringement issue. It encourages Bert to handle the situation professionally, objectively, and respectfully. Additionally, it highlights the need to uphold professional ethics by protecting the intellectual property rights of his former employer and maintaining integrity in his current workplace.

However, there are a few areas for improvement. Firstly, the answer could have suggested that Bert reach out to his former employer, County Line Design, to confirm whether they had given permission for the use of the drawings. This step could provide crucial information for Bert's case. Secondly, the answer could have recommended Bert document all his actions and communications regarding this issue to have a clear record of his efforts to address the situation. This documentation could be valuable in case legal action becomes necessary.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and actionable plan for Bert to address the potential intellectual property infringement issue, but it could benefit from including additional steps for thoroughness and documentation.
