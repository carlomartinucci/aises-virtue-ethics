The answers provided are practical and specific, offering a clear methodology for determining fees based on the scope of the project, level of effort required, and the value of services provided. The approach of setting a fee slightly higher for Zeller than for Hartwell, due to potential added value or expertise, is a reasonable strategy. Additionally, considering offering a slightly discounted fee to Hartwell as a repeat client demonstrates a good practice of maintaining positive client relationships.

Openly discussing the rationale behind the fee and ensuring that it aligns with the value delivered can further strengthen trust and collaboration with clients.
