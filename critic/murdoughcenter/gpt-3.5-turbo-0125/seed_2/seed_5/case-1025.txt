Your response to the scenario is practical and specific. By declining the settlement offer and opting to defend your firm in court, you are taking a stand based on the evidence and documentation available, which is commendable. Your intention to work closely with your lawyer to present a strong defense and ensure accurate communication of the facts also reflects a proactive approach to the situation.

One area for improvement could be conducting a thorough review of the actions of the contractor, bank, architect, and structural engineer to determine if they acted unethically by failing to obtain permission for the tiebacks and not abandoning them as planned. This review could help in understanding the roles and responsibilities of all parties involved and potentially identify any shared accountability or negligence.

Overall, your decision to stand by the evidence and defend your firm in court is a principled approach, and further investigation into the actions of other parties could provide additional insights for a comprehensive response to the situation.
