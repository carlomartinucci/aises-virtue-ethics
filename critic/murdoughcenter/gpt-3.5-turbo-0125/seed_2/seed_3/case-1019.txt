The answer provided is ethical as it involves documenting observations, gathering information discreetly, seeking guidance from the company's leadership, and considering involving relevant departments to address the issue of potential conflicts of interest and compromising project quality. 

The good in this answer lies in the proactive approach taken by Tim to document the situation, seek guidance from higher management, and prioritize the firm's interests and project quality. By involving the president and potentially HR or legal departments, Tim is taking steps to address the issue in a structured and responsible manner.

However, a potential drawback could be the lack of immediate action to address the situation with Roy. While gathering information and seeking guidance are important steps, there is a risk that delays in addressing potential conflicts of interest and compromised project quality could harm the firm's reputation and financial interests. Tim should consider taking more immediate steps to mitigate any ongoing risks while following the prescribed course of action.

To improve, Tim should consider implementing measures to monitor and address any immediate impacts on ongoing projects while proceeding with the documented approach of involving higher management and relevant departments. This would ensure a more comprehensive and timely resolution to the ethical dilemma at hand.
