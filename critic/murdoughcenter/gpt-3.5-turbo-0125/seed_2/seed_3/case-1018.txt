The answer provided is very detailed and practical in addressing the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. By documenting the situation, scheduling individual meetings with the students involved, reviewing the academic integrity policy, and seeking guidance from senior faculty or an academic integrity committee, the response demonstrates a clear and structured approach to addressing the issue.

One positive aspect of the response is the emphasis on fairness and impartiality in handling the situation. By considering the consequences of academic misconduct, following university policies, and seeking guidance from senior faculty, the answer shows a commitment to upholding academic integrity and protecting the reputation of the graduate program.

However, one area for improvement could be to explicitly mention the importance of educating the students on academic integrity principles and the seriousness of plagiarism. This could help deter future misconduct and promote a culture of honesty and ethical behavior among students.
