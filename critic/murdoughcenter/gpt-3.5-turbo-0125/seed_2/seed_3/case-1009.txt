The answer provided is ethical in that it addresses the situation professionally and seeks a fair resolution. By expressing disappointment to Mr. Young and reminding him of the value of the work outlined in the proposal, the responder is standing up for their firm's effort and expertise. Additionally, the suggestion to inquire about revisiting the agreement and negotiating terms shows a proactive approach to potentially salvage the situation.

However, the answer could be improved by being more assertive in advocating for the firm's position. For instance, the responder could emphasize the unique strengths and benefits their firm brings to the project more explicitly, making a stronger case for reconsideration. Additionally, proposing specific ways in which the firm could add value or adjust the terms of the agreement could increase the chances of a favorable outcome.

Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of professional conduct and conflict resolution but could benefit from more assertiveness and specificity in advocating for the firm's interests. By being clearer and more proactive in their approach, the responder could potentially achieve a better outcome in this situation.
