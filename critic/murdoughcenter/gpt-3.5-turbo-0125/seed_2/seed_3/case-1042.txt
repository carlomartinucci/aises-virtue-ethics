The advice given to Rashid is ethical as it encourages him to prioritize public safety and ethical considerations over potential conflicts with his superiors. The recommendation to document the issue, gather evidence, and raise concerns with his supervisor in a formal manner is practical and actionable. It emphasizes the importance of presenting his case logically and clearly, focusing on the quality and safety of the project.

However, the advice could be improved by suggesting that Rashid also explore potential solutions or suggestions for addressing the problem during his meeting with Riley. Providing actionable steps or proposals for rectifying the issue would demonstrate proactive problem-solving skills and a commitment to finding a resolution. Additionally, the evaluation could have highlighted the importance of Rashid following up on the outcome of the discussion with Riley and taking further steps if necessary to ensure the issue is addressed properly.
