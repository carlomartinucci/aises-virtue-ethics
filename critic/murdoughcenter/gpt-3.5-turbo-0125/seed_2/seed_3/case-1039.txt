By advising Shariq to contact his supervisor, Chuck Ashby, and provide all the necessary details, including offering the samples for testing, the answer promotes transparency and accountability in handling the situation.

However, the evaluation could be improved by suggesting that Shariq document his communication with Chuck in writing to create a record of the conversation and actions taken.
