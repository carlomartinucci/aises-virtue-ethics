The answer provided is very ethical and practical. By suggesting that Jack should contact the drilling crew and geologist for clarification and verification of the data, it emphasizes the importance of ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the information he relies on for his design recommendations. The recommendation to request detailed information, additional documentation, and even consider arranging for new drilling if necessary shows a proactive approach to resolving the issue at hand.

Furthermore, the advice to document all communication and actions taken demonstrates a commitment to transparency and accountability, which are crucial in maintaining professional standards and client trust. Overall, the response provides clear, actionable steps for Jack to follow in addressing the situation effectively and ethically.

Keeping the client informed and managing their expectations can help maintain a positive client relationship despite any necessary delays in the project timeline.
