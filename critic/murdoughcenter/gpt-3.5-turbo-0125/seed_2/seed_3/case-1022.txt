The answers provided are practical and specific, offering a clear approach to determining the fees in each scenario. 

For Question 1, the response suggests assessing the project's scope and complexity to determine the fee, which is a good practice to ensure fair compensation for the work. The consideration of offering a slightly higher fee than what was charged to Hartwell, based on additional value or expertise, demonstrates a thoughtful approach to pricing services.

In Question 2, the answer recommends a similar approach for determining the fee when working with Hartwell, emphasizing evaluating project requirements and the level of effort needed. The idea of potentially offering a slightly discounted fee to maintain a positive relationship with a repeat client like Hartwell is a practical way to prioritize long-term partnerships.

Regarding Question 3, the answer appropriately recognizes that the decision on the fee for working with Zeller should not change based on whether Hartwell decides not to bid on the project. This consistency in fee determination is a fair and ethical approach, ensuring that the value of services provided to Zeller remains the primary consideration.

Overall, the responses provide actionable steps for determining fees in different scenarios, taking into account factors such as project complexity, client relationships, and value proposition. The approach is fair and pragmatic, focusing on the specific circumstances of each situation to arrive at reasonable fee structures.
