The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it accurately reflects the cost estimate for the new project considering the reuse of information from the previous project. By being transparent with the client about the cost breakdown and the rationale behind the estimate, it maintains integrity in the business relationship.

However, the ethical evaluation can be improved by addressing the financial implications of the overrun on the Dawson project. It would be prudent to acknowledge the budgetary issues faced on the previous project and perhaps offer some solutions or concessions to rectify the situation with the client, such as discussing a payment plan for the additional costs incurred.

In summary, while the response is commendable for its transparency and cost-effectiveness, a more comprehensive ethical evaluation would involve addressing the financial impact of the overrun on the previous project and proposing potential solutions to mitigate any negative consequences for both parties involved.
