Your answer provides clear and specific guidance to Julie on how to handle the situation regarding the structural issues of the building. You correctly emphasize the importance of prioritizing safety and ethical responsibility over potential business implications. By advising Julie to seek a second opinion from another structural engineer and consider disclosing the critical information to the prospective buyers, you offer actionable steps for her to take.

However, your response could be improved by suggesting that Julie consult with legal counsel to understand the potential legal implications of withholding such critical information. This would provide a more comprehensive approach to the situation, ensuring that Julie considers all aspects before making a decision. Additionally, you could have emphasized the importance of documenting all communications and actions taken in case of any future disputes or legal issues.

Overall, your answer is practical and actionable, but it can be enhanced by incorporating legal considerations and documentation practices into Julie's decision-making process.
