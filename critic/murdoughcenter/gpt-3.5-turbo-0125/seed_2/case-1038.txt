The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of disclosing the conflict of interest involving Elias and Shellie's joint venture owning property that would benefit from the construction of the new road. By recommending that Daulton should immediately disclose the situation to his superiors, seek legal counsel, and consider involving a third-party mediator or ethics committee, the answer promotes transparency and accountability in addressing the ethical dilemma.

The recommendation to seek guidance from superiors and legal counsel shows a proactive approach to handling the situation and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. Involving a third-party mediator or ethics committee can help maintain impartiality and ensure that all stakeholders are informed and involved in the decision-making process.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific steps on how Daulton should disclose the conflict of interest, what actions he should take if his superiors are not responsive, and how to mitigate potential negative consequences for ClearWater Developers. Additionally, addressing the potential impact on the project timeline and budget would enhance the practicality of the response.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma but could benefit from more detailed and actionable steps to guide Daulton in navigating the situation effectively.
