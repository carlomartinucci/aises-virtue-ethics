The answer provided is ethical as it advises Rod to report the observed gifts to the supervisor at the DOT headquarters, Ethel Hicks, in a timely manner with clear and specific details. It also suggests documenting the incidents in writing for accuracy and reference. By addressing the issue promptly and directly with the appropriate authority, the answer upholds ethical standards and promotes integrity in the project.

However, to improve the answer, it could have included a suggestion to also discuss the matter with Rod's advisor at school, Dr. R. E. Serchur, as there is a potential impact on Rod's academic evaluation. This additional step would ensure transparency and accountability in all aspects of the situation. Furthermore, the answer could have emphasized the importance of confidentiality to protect Rod and others involved from potential repercussions.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable solution to the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario, but it could be enhanced by including suggestions for further communication with Rod's academic advisor and emphasizing the need for confidentiality.
