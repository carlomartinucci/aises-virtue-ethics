The answer provided is ethical as it outlines a clear and systematic approach to addressing the issue of potential plagiarism among the students. By documenting the situation, scheduling individual meetings, reviewing the academic integrity policy, and seeking guidance from senior faculty or an academic integrity committee, the response demonstrates a commitment to fairness and upholding academic standards.

One positive aspect is the emphasis on due process and giving the students an opportunity to explain themselves. This approach shows a willingness to consider all perspectives before making a decision. Additionally, seeking guidance from senior faculty or an academic integrity committee reflects a desire to handle the situation in a responsible and informed manner.

However, one area for improvement could be to explicitly mention the importance of educating the students on academic integrity and the consequences of plagiarism. Providing clarity on the seriousness of the issue and the impact it can have on their academic and professional futures would enhance the ethical approach outlined in the response.

Overall, the answer is practical and actionable, offering a step-by-step plan for addressing the plagiarism issue while considering the implications for both the students and the university's academic integrity.
