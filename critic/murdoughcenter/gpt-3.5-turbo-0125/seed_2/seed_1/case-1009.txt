The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on expressing disappointment, reminding the client of the value offered, and attempting to negotiate a fair arrangement. By addressing the situation directly with Mr. Young and seeking clarification on the decision, the response reflects a commitment to fairness and professionalism.

On the positive side, the response acknowledges the effort put into preparing the proposal and communicates the firm's value proposition effectively. The suggestion to inquire about revisiting the agreement and negotiate terms demonstrates a proactive approach to resolving the issue.

However, there are areas for improvement. The response could have included a more assertive stance in negotiating to secure a fair deal for the firm. Additionally, there could have been a clearer emphasis on the importance of respecting the original proposal process and the firm's investment in preparing the scope of work.

Overall, the response is practical in addressing the situation, but it could benefit from a more assertive negotiation stance to potentially secure involvement in the project. The focus on learning from the experience and improving future client interactions is commendable, emphasizing a growth mindset in handling similar situations in the future.
