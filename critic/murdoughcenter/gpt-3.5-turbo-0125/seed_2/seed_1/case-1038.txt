The answer provided is ethical as it advocates for immediate disclosure of the conflict of interest, seeking guidance from superiors, involving legal counsel, and potentially engaging a third-party mediator or ethics committee. This response acknowledges the importance of transparency, compliance with laws and regulations, and involving all stakeholders in the decision-making process. By taking these actions, Daulton would demonstrate a commitment to integrity and accountability in addressing the ethical dilemma at hand.

However, a potential drawback of the answer is the lack of emphasis on the urgency of the situation. Daulton should be advised to act promptly to mitigate any further potential risks associated with the conflict of interest. Additionally, the answer could benefit from suggesting specific steps on how to engage with Elias and Shellie in a constructive manner to address the issue directly. Overall, the response provides a solid foundation for handling the ethical dilemma but could be improved by incorporating more actionable and time-sensitive recommendations.
