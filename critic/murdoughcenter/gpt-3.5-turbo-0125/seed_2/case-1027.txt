The answer provided is ethical as it involves transparency with the client, clearly stating the cost estimate for the new project and justifying it based on the reuse of existing information. By clarifying the scope of work covered by the amount, it ensures alignment with the client's expectations.

However, there are some potential drawbacks to consider. While it is commendable to be transparent about the cost estimate, it is also important to address the overrun on the previous project with Bill Broot. It would be beneficial to have a discussion about the additional work done on the Dawson project that was not initially included in the scope of work and the resulting financial implications. This would help in setting clear boundaries for future projects and avoiding similar situations.

In conclusion, the response is mostly ethical and practical, emphasizing transparency and cost-effectiveness. To improve, it would be advisable to address the overrun on the Dawson project with the client and establish clear boundaries for scope creep in future projects.
