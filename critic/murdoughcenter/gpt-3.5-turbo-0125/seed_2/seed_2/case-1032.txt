The answer provided is ethical as it advocates for a proactive approach to address the concerns of the poorer families downstream while still allowing the development to proceed. By recommending a meeting with the design engineers to discuss possible modifications, the answer shows a willingness to find a solution that considers both the economic benefits of progress and the well-being of the impacted community. This approach demonstrates a sense of responsibility and care for all stakeholders involved.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting additional steps that Topher could take to ensure transparency and accountability in the decision-making process. For example, Topher could consider organizing a public forum or consultation to gather input from a wider range of community members and stakeholders. This would help to ensure that all voices are heard and taken into consideration before a final decision is made. Additionally, Topher could explore options for providing support or compensation to the affected families to mitigate the negative impacts of the development.

Overall, the answer provided offers a practical and actionable solution to a complex ethical dilemma, but could benefit from further emphasis on transparency and community engagement in the decision-making process.
