The answer provided is ethical as it advocates for Daulton to disclose the conflict of interest involving Elias and Shellie's joint venture owning property that could benefit from the construction of the new road. By recommending that Daulton inform his superiors, seek legal counsel, and potentially involve a third-party mediator or ethics committee, the answer emphasizes transparency and compliance with laws and regulations. This approach prioritizes ethical behavior and accountability in handling the situation.

However, the evaluation could be enhanced by suggesting specific steps for Daulton to take when disclosing the conflict of interest. For example, he could document all relevant information, prepare a detailed report outlining the situation, and propose potential solutions to mitigate the conflict. Additionally, seeking guidance from an ethics officer within ClearWater Developers or an external ethics expert could provide further clarity on the best course of action.

Overall, the answer provides a strong foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma at hand, but could benefit from more actionable and detailed steps for Daulton to follow when navigating the situation.
