The answer provided is ethical as it advises Rod to report the observed gifts to Ethel Hicks, the supervisor at the DOT headquarters, in a timely manner with clear and specific details. It also suggests documenting the incidents in writing for accuracy and reference. By addressing the issue promptly and directly with the appropriate authority, it upholds ethical standards and integrity in the project. This course of action is practical and actionable, as it provides a clear plan for handling the situation.

However, one area for improvement could be to also advise Rod to consider discussing the issue directly with the resident engineer, Jim Upwright, before reporting to Ethel Hicks. This step could potentially allow for clarification or explanation from the resident engineer before involving higher management. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of confidentiality and professionalism in handling this matter could further enhance the ethical approach.

Overall, the answer provides a specific and practical course of action for Rod to take in a potentially ethically challenging situation, but could benefit from including additional steps for direct communication with the resident engineer and highlighting the importance of confidentiality.
