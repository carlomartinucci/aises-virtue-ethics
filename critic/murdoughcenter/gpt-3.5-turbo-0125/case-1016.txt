Your responses to the scenario questions are detailed and consider the ethical implications of the situations presented. You emphasize transparency, integrity, and professionalism in your decision-making process, which is commendable. Your approach to seeking guidance from relevant authorities and evaluating the consequences of your actions shows a thoughtful consideration of the ethical dilemmas at hand.

To improve your responses further, you could provide more specific actions you would take in each scenario to address the ethical challenges. For example, outlining steps such as documenting concerns, seeking advice from ethics committees, or escalating the issue to higher authorities would enhance the practicality of your responses. Additionally, considering potential consequences of different courses of action and how to mitigate risks would strengthen your evaluation.

Overall, your responses demonstrate a good understanding of ethical considerations in professional decision-making, but adding more specific actions and risk assessment would make your approach even more actionable and practical.
