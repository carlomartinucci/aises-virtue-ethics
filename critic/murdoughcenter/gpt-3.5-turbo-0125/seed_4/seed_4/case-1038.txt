The answer provided is ethical and practical. It recommends that Daulton disclose the conflict of interest involving Elias and Shellie owning property that would benefit from the construction of the new road. By informing ClearWater Developers' senior management and legal counsel, Daulton can work towards addressing the situation transparently and ethically. This approach prioritizes integrity and fairness in business dealings, which is commendable.

However, the evaluation could be improved by suggesting specific steps for Daulton to take after disclosing the conflict of interest. For example, he could propose revisiting the project plans with a neutral party involved in the decision-making process, ensuring that all relevant stakeholders are informed about the situation, and implementing measures to prevent similar conflicts in the future. Providing more actionable steps would enhance the evaluation's practicality and effectiveness.
