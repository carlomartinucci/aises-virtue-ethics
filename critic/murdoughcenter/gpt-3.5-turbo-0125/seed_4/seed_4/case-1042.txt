The answer provided is a practical and actionable solution to Rashid's dilemma. By advising Rashid to document his concerns in writing and submit a formal report to both Riley and the building inspector, Janis, the answer encourages Rashid to take a proactive approach in addressing the potential problem with the steel beam coating. This approach demonstrates a commitment to upholding standards and ensuring public safety, which are important ethical considerations in a construction project.

However, one potential downside of this approach is that it may lead to conflict with Riley, who has already expressed his disinterest in Rashid raising the issue. Rashid may face pushback or negative repercussions for challenging the status quo. Additionally, the answer could have further emphasized the importance of seeking support from other colleagues or higher management within the company to strengthen Rashid's position and protect him from potential backlash.

Overall, the answer provides a solid course of action for Rashid to address the ethical dilemma he faces while working within the constraints of his role and the expectations of his superiors. It encourages him to prioritize quality and safety while also seeking guidance from relevant stakeholders.
