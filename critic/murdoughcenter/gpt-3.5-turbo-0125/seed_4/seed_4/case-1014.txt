The answer provided is specific and actionable, which is commendable. By advising Roger to have a more explicit conversation with Bill Mason, emphasizing ethical concerns and seeking clarification on the firm's policies, it offers a practical approach to addressing the issue. The recommendation to request assurance for future incidents and consider escalation if necessary demonstrates a proactive stance on preserving integrity.

However, the response could be improved by including guidance on how Roger should handle the situation if Bill Mason's response is dismissive or unsatisfactory. It would be beneficial to suggest potential next steps in case the initial conversation does not yield the desired outcome, such as seeking guidance from an external ethics committee or professional organization.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for Roger to address the ethical dilemma effectively, but enhancing it with contingency plans for different scenarios would make it even more robust and actionable.
