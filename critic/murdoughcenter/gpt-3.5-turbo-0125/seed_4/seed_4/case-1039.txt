The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of informing the supervisor about the situation regarding the drums and highlights the potential environmental and legal risks associated with the false information. It also suggests taking appropriate steps to address the situation and notifying the proper authorities about the mishandling of hazardous waste. By offering to provide documentation and evidence to support the claims, it shows a proactive approach to rectifying the situation.

The good aspects of this response include the immediate action proposed to contact the supervisor, the emphasis on transparency and potential risks, and the offer to provide necessary support to address the issue effectively. The response is practical and actionable in terms of resolving the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario.

However, a potential improvement could be to also consider escalating the matter to higher authorities within the company or external regulatory bodies if the supervisor does not take appropriate action. This additional step would further ensure that the mishandling of hazardous waste is addressed properly and in accordance with legal and ethical standards.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical issue at hand, but could benefit from expanding the course of action to include escalation procedures if needed.
