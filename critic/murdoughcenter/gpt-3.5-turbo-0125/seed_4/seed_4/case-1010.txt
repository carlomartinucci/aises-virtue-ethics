Your answer provides a practical and actionable solution to the ethical situation faced by Julie. By advising her to conduct further investigation with an independent structural engineer, you suggest a proactive approach to gathering more information about the building's structural integrity. This would help Julie make informed decisions and potentially prevent any safety risks associated with the rusted clip angles. Additionally, documenting all findings and discussions is a good suggestion to maintain transparency and protect her firm's reputation.

However, your answer could be improved by emphasizing the importance of prioritizing safety and ethical considerations over potential business relationships. Julie should be encouraged to prioritize the safety of the building occupants and the public above all else. Additionally, it would be beneficial to suggest that Julie seek legal counsel to understand her obligations and potential liabilities in this situation.

Overall, your response provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma faced by Julie, but it could be strengthened by emphasizing the importance of safety, ethical responsibility, and seeking legal advice.
