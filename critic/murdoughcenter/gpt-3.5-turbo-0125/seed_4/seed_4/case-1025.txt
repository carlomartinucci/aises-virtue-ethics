The answer provided is ethical and practical. By rejecting the settlement offer and choosing to defend the firm in court, the assistant is standing by their principles and maintaining integrity. Additionally, instructing the lawyer to present all evidence supporting the firm's position, including the advice given to the bank regarding obtaining permission for the tiebacks, is a proactive step in defending against the allegations.

One improvement could be to also address the issue of the tiebacks not being abandoned after construction, as this was part of the original plan. Ensuring that the firm takes responsibility for any oversights or deviations from the initial design plan would further strengthen their position in the litigation.

Overall, the assistant's proposed course of action is clear, ethical, and focused on defending the firm's reputation and integrity in the face of unfounded accusations.
