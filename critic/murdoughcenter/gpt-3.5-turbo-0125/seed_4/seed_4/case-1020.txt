Your answer is specific and actionable, demonstrating a clear plan of action in a challenging situation. By stating that you would attend the mediation hearing to present the technical facts and maintain your position of non-involvement in the claim, you show determination and a commitment to integrity. Emphasizing that your firm does not bear financial responsibility and seeking legal advice if threatened adds a layer of prudence to your approach.

However, there are some areas for improvement. You could further strengthen your response by mentioning the importance of documenting all interactions with Noall and the developer to protect your firm's interests. Additionally, considering the potential implications of the threat to revoke your Professional Engineer's license on your career and reputation would add depth to your evaluation. Overall, your response is mostly clear and practical, but enhancing it with these additional considerations would make it even more comprehensive.
