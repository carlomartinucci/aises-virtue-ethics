The answers provided are practical and specific, offering a clear methodology for determining fees based on the scope of work, expertise required, potential value of the solution, and industry standards. The consideration of previous successful collaborations, level of assistance needed, and market rates demonstrates a thoughtful approach to fee calculation. 

However, there are some ethical concerns to address. While it is commendable to factor in the potential benefits to the clients and the impact of expertise on project success, there is a lack of explicit mention of ensuring fairness and transparency in fee negotiations. It would be beneficial to emphasize the importance of ethical pricing practices, such as avoiding overcharging or underpricing based on the client's perceived ability to pay or lack of competition.

Furthermore, in the scenario where Hartwell decides not to bid, there is an opportunity to highlight the importance of maintaining integrity and fairness in fee determination even without competitive pressure. It would be advisable to explicitly state the need to uphold ethical standards regardless of the circumstances.

Overall, the responses provide a solid framework for fee calculation, but could benefit from a stronger emphasis on ethical considerations, transparency, and fairness in pricing practices. It would be beneficial to incorporate language that explicitly addresses these ethical principles to ensure a well-rounded evaluation.
