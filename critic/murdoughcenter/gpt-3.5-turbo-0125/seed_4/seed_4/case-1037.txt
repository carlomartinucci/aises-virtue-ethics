The answer provided is mostly ethical as it involves documenting relevant information and bringing it to the attention of the legal counsel, which could impact the ongoing case. By disclosing the potential personal relationship between Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert, it aims to ensure transparency and assist in assessing the credibility and potential biases of the expert witness retained by the plaintiff. This action aligns with maintaining the integrity of the legal process and ensuring all relevant information is considered.

However, one potential concern is the lack of clarity on the specific implications of the personal relationship between Cleghorn and Cuthbert on the case. While it is crucial to inform the legal counsel about this information, the answer could be improved by providing recommendations on how this information could be utilized or addressed in the legal proceedings. Additionally, it would be beneficial to emphasize the importance of maintaining objectivity and avoiding any conflicts of interest in the case.

Overall, the response is practical and actionable in terms of addressing the discovered information, but it could benefit from further elaboration on the potential impact of the relationship between Cleghorn and Cuthbert on the case and how best to handle such a situation within the legal context.
