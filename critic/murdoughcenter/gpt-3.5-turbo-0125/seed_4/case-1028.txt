The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes transparency and honesty in billing practices, aligning with the clients' expectations of being billed at actual cost without any markups for overhead expenses. By choosing not to sign up for the service offered by CCC, the individual maintains integrity in their professional conduct.

However, it would be beneficial to also consider the potential impact on the firm's financial sustainability. While it is commendable to prioritize transparency, it is essential to ensure that the firm's financial health is not compromised. One practical approach could be to have a conversation with clients about the challenges posed by the current billing method and explore alternative solutions that meet both the clients' expectations and the firm's financial needs. This proactive communication can foster stronger client relationships and potentially lead to mutually beneficial agreements on billing practices.

In summary, while the decision not to sign up for the service is ethical and aligns with transparency principles, it is important to balance ethical considerations with the firm's financial viability through open communication with clients to find mutually agreeable solutions.
