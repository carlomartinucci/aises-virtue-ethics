The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of disclosing the conflict of interest involving Elias and Shellie owning property that would benefit from the construction of the new road. By recommending immediate disclosure to ClearWater Developers' senior management and legal counsel, it promotes transparency and integrity in business dealings. The suggestion to revisit project plans and ensure full disclosure to all relevant parties is practical and actionable in addressing the conflict of interest.

However, the evaluation could be improved by providing more specific steps on how Daulton should approach senior management and legal counsel, such as preparing a detailed report outlining the situation, potential implications, and proposed solutions. Additionally, it would be beneficial to mention the importance of documenting all communications and decisions made regarding the conflict of interest to ensure accountability and transparency moving forward. Overall, the answer is clear and actionable, but could benefit from more detailed guidance on the next steps for Daulton to take in handling the situation effectively.
