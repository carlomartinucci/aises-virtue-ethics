The answer provided is ethical as it addresses the issue of the over-designed foundation and offers a practical solution to address the concerns. By suggesting a meeting with Walker to discuss the implications of the excessive use of concrete and steel, Robert is taking a proactive approach to rectify the situation. The recommendation to provide further guidance for the remaining structures and emphasize the importance of a qualified design team shows a commitment to ensuring future constructions are cost-effective and structurally sound.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific details on how Robert can navigate the conversation with Walker effectively. For instance, outlining potential strategies to communicate the technical aspects of the geotechnical recommendations in a clear and understandable manner to a non-technical audience would enhance the practicality of the response. Additionally, suggesting ways to address any potential pushback or resistance from Walker in implementing the recommended changes would strengthen the actionable nature of the answer.
