The answer provided is practical and specific, demonstrating a proactive approach to the situation. By expressing gratitude, showing interest, and seeking clarification on specific concerns raised by the planning commission, the response shows a willingness to engage with the client and understand their needs. Scheduling a meeting and preparing a detailed proposal based on the information gathered is a strong strategy to showcase expertise and address potential issues that were highlighted in the preliminary report.

One improvement could be to also address the potential conflict of interest due to the involvement of a competitor's recommendations in the preliminary report. It would be beneficial to acknowledge this, assure John Bigge of your impartiality, and emphasize your commitment to providing objective and high-quality engineering services regardless of past competition.

Overall, the response is action-oriented and tailored to the specific circumstances of the scenario, offering a well-rounded approach to handling the client's request.
