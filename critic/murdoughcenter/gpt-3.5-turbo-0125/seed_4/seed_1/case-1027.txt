The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes transparency and honesty in dealing with the client, Bill Broot. By explaining the breakdown of the estimated cost and proposing a revised cost estimate based on reused information, it demonstrates a commitment to fair and open communication. This approach helps to maintain trust and integrity in the business relationship, which is crucial for long-term success.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the issue of the overrun on the Dawson project more directly. While it mentions the importance of learning from past mistakes, it does not offer a concrete plan to prevent similar budget overruns in the future. It would be beneficial to include specific steps or strategies that will be implemented to ensure better cost management and project oversight moving forward.

Overall, the answer is on the right track by focusing on transparency and communication with the client. To enhance its effectiveness, it should also incorporate a clear plan for addressing budget concerns proactively in future projects.
