The answer provided is ethical as it promotes transparency and honesty in billing practices by adhering to clients' requests to be billed at actual costs without any added markups for overhead expenses. By refusing to sign up for CCC's service that allows for internal markups, the individual ensures that clients are not overcharged and that billing remains straightforward.

However, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks of this approach. By not taking advantage of CCC's service, the firm may be missing out on an opportunity to streamline billing processes and potentially improve profitability. Additionally, while maintaining honesty and transparency is commendable, it is also essential to ensure that the firm's financial sustainability is not compromised.

To address these concerns, the individual could explore the possibility of negotiating with clients to find a middle ground that allows for fair billing while also covering necessary overhead costs. This could involve transparent discussions with clients about the challenges of covering overhead expenses and seeking their understanding in incorporating a reasonable markup to ensure the firm's financial health.

Overall, while the decision to stick to billing clients at actual costs is ethical and aligns with transparency principles, it is important to balance ethical considerations with the practical aspects of maintaining a sustainable business operation. Open communication and negotiation with clients can help strike a fair balance that benefits both parties.
