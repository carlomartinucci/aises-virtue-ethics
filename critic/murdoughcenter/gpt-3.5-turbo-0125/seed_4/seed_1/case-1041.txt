The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of prioritizing worker safety and legal compliance. It suggests that Carlos should firmly communicate his concerns to his boss, document his recommendations, and seek advice from legal experts if needed. These actions demonstrate a commitment to ethical principles and a willingness to uphold safety and legal standards, even if it means risking his contract with the company.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how Carlos can navigate the situation practically. For example, suggesting concrete steps for Carlos to take in case his boss does not listen to his concerns, such as reporting the situation to relevant authorities or seeking support from worker advocacy groups, would enhance the actionable nature of the response. Additionally, addressing potential consequences for Carlos, such as losing his job or damaging his relationship with his employer, would provide a more realistic view of the challenges he may face in standing up for ethical principles.
