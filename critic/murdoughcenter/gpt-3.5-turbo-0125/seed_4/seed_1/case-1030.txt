The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of prioritizing safety and regulatory compliance in the wastewater treatment plant project. It offers a practical and actionable approach for Reilly to follow, including gathering information, consulting with experts, communicating concerns, and proposing a plan to address any potential issues.

The good aspects of the answer include the focus on ensuring safety and compliance, the suggestion to seek expert advice, and the emphasis on effective communication with relevant stakeholders. By proposing a plan to address the situation, Reilly is taking proactive steps to resolve the issue and prevent any potential risks.

However, one area for improvement is the lack of specific details on how Reilly should approach the consultation with the fire safety expert or how to communicate concerns effectively to Dante and the project manager. Providing more specific guidance on these steps could enhance the answer's practicality and effectiveness.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for Reilly to handle the situation ethically and responsibly, but could benefit from more specific instructions on certain actions to improve its practicality.
