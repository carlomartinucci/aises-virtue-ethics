The advice to document his concerns in writing and submit a formal report to both Riley and the building inspector, Janis, is a practical and actionable step for Rashid to take. By outlining the specific issue, potential risks, and his attempts to address the concern internally, Rashid is taking a proactive approach to addressing the quality and safety concerns of the project. Seeking a meeting with both Riley and Janis to discuss the issue further shows Rashid's willingness to engage with relevant parties and seek guidance on how to proceed.

However, one potential downside is the lack of emphasis on navigating the power dynamics at play, especially considering Riley's dismissive response previously. Rashid may face challenges in asserting his concerns given his new and inexperienced position, and the advice could be strengthened by including strategies for handling potential pushback from superiors.

Overall, the advice is a good starting point for Rashid to address the issue effectively, but additional consideration could be given to addressing power differentials and potential resistance from higher-ups in the organization.
