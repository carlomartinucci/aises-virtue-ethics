Daulton's decision to disclose the conflict of interest involving Elias and Shellie owning property that would benefit from the construction of the new road is a positive step towards maintaining ethical standards in business practices. By informing ClearWater Developers' senior management and legal counsel, Daulton is taking responsibility for addressing the issue and seeking guidance on the best course of action.

However, the evaluation could be more actionable and specific in terms of outlining the steps Daulton should take to ensure transparency and fairness in handling the conflict of interest. For instance, he should document all communications related to the issue, collaborate with legal experts to assess potential legal implications, and revise project plans to mitigate any unethical conduct. Additionally, fostering an open dialogue with all stakeholders involved in the project is essential to rebuild trust and credibility in the community.

Overall, while the recommendation to disclose the conflict of interest is commendable, providing more detailed steps and strategies for addressing the issue would enhance the evaluation's practicality and effectiveness in resolving the ethical dilemma at hand.
