The answer provided is ethical to an extent as it encourages Roger to address his concerns with his boss, Bill Mason, and seek clarification on the firm's policies. By emphasizing the potential ethical issues and requesting assurance for the future, Roger is taking a step in the right direction to uphold integrity and confidentiality in his work.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting more concrete actions that Roger can take. For instance, he could request a meeting with all relevant parties to discuss the implications of sharing draft reports with external stakeholders prematurely. Additionally, seeking guidance from a professional engineering ethics organization or legal counsel could provide Roger with a broader perspective on the situation.

In summary, while the answer acknowledges the importance of addressing ethical concerns, it could be enhanced by providing more specific steps for Roger to take and considering external sources of advice to navigate the complex ethical landscape of the engineering consultancy industry.
