The answer provided is a practical and specific course of action in response to the scenario presented. By first reviewing the university's academic integrity policy, scheduling individual meetings with the students involved, and considering appropriate consequences based on the policy, the response demonstrates a clear understanding of the steps needed to address the issue of plagiarism effectively.

Furthermore, the emphasis on fairness and integrity in grading the remaining projects showcases a commitment to upholding academic standards and ensuring that all students are evaluated equitably.

However, the response could be improved by explicitly mentioning the importance of educating students on academic integrity and the consequences of plagiarism before they embark on their projects. This proactive approach could potentially deter future instances of academic misconduct and promote a culture of honesty and originality among students.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for addressing the plagiarism issue in a fair and actionable manner, but it could benefit from incorporating preventative measures to promote ethical behavior from the outset.
