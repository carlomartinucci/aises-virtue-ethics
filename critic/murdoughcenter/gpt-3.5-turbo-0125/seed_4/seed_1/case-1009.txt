The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on expressing disappointment, seeking feedback, and aiming to improve the working relationship with the client. This approach shows a commitment to professionalism and open communication, which are positive aspects. By addressing the issue directly with the client and seeking constructive feedback, the answer demonstrates a willingness to learn and adapt for future interactions.

However, one improvement could be to also inquire about the terms of the agreement with the competitor, as it seems they offered a different payment structure. Understanding the reasons behind the client's decision beyond just the competitor's pricing could provide valuable insights for future proposals. Additionally, proposing a follow-up meeting to discuss how to prevent similar misunderstandings in the future would be a proactive step towards building a stronger client relationship.

Overall, the response is ethical and emphasizes the importance of clear communication and professionalism, but could benefit from a more thorough exploration of the client's decision-making process and a proactive approach to prevent similar situations in the future.
