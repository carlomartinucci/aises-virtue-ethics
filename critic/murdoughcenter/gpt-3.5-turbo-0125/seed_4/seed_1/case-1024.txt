The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on reporting the observed incidents to the appropriate authorities within the Department of Transportation, specifically bringing it to the attention of Ethel Hicks, who is the supervisor of the resident engineer. This action promotes transparency and integrity in the project, which is crucial in upholding ethical standards.

The good aspects of the answer include the proactive approach of reporting the incidents promptly to ensure that any potential unethical behavior is addressed. By documenting the incidents with detail, the response also emphasizes the importance of providing clear and accurate information to support the report.

However, a potential improvement could be to also consider reporting the incidents to an additional authority within the DOT, such as the ethics or compliance department, to ensure that the issue is addressed from multiple angles and to prevent any potential conflicts of interest that may arise by solely reporting to Ethel Hicks.

Overall, the answer is practical and actionable, providing a clear course of action to address the observed unethical behavior while emphasizing the importance of transparency and integrity in the project.
