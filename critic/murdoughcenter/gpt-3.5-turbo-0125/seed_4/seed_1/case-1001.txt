The answer provided is practical and specific in advising Turnbuckle on how to handle the situation. It correctly suggests gathering relevant documentation, consulting with a lawyer specializing in engineering law, responding promptly to the complaint, and cooperating fully with the state Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors. This advice is actionable and provides a clear roadmap for Turnbuckle to address the issue effectively.

However, one potential improvement could be to emphasize the importance of demonstrating that Turnbuckle's engineering work was done competently and ethically despite not having a license in the state at the time. This could bolster his defense against Stout's complaint and show that he acted in good faith to address the situation once he became aware of the licensing requirement.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for Turnbuckle to navigate the legal challenge he is facing, but further emphasizing the importance of demonstrating the quality of his work could strengthen his position.
