However, the answer could be improved by including a more assertive stance in protecting the firm's interests. It would be beneficial to inquire about the terms of confidentiality and exclusivity in the initial discussions to ensure that the firm's proposals are not shared with competitors without consent. Additionally, proposing a discussion on potential compensation for the time and effort invested in preparing the proposal could be considered to uphold the firm's value and expertise.

Overall, the response is ethical and emphasizes the importance of communication and feedback in professional relationships. By incorporating a more assertive approach to safeguard the firm's interests and discussing potential compensation, the answer could be more comprehensive and proactive in addressing the situation.
