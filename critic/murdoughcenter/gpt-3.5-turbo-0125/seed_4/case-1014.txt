The answer provided is a good starting point in addressing the ethical concerns raised in the scenario. It correctly advises Roger to express his concerns to his boss, Bill Mason, and seek clarification on the firm's policies regarding client confidentiality and sensitive project information. This proactive approach is commendable as it shows a willingness to address potential ethical issues within the organization.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting more concrete actions for Roger to take. For instance, Roger should explicitly request a meeting with both Frank Bullock and Bill Mason to discuss the situation and ensure that his concerns are heard by all relevant parties. This direct communication can help clarify any misunderstandings and reinforce the importance of maintaining client confidentiality.

Furthermore, the answer could have emphasized the importance of documenting the conversation with Bill Mason and any subsequent actions taken to address the issue. This documentation can serve as a record of Roger's ethical decision-making process and protect him in case of any future disputes or repercussions.

Overall, while the answer provides a good foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma, it could benefit from more specific and actionable steps for Roger to take in handling the situation effectively.
