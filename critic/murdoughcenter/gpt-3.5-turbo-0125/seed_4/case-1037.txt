The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it emphasizes the importance of disclosing relevant information that could impact the ongoing case. By documenting and bringing to light the potential personal relationship between Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert, the consultant is acting in the interest of ensuring transparency and fairness in the legal proceedings.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting a more proactive approach. Instead of just informing Fulton Adams, the consultant could recommend discussing this information with the legal team and potentially raising it with the court if deemed necessary. This would ensure that all parties involved are aware of the situation and can make informed decisions based on the complete picture.

Overall, the answer is on the right track in terms of ethical considerations but could benefit from a more assertive and proactive stance in addressing the potential conflict of interest.
