The answer provided is ethical as it suggests seeking advice from a trusted mentor or colleague, reviewing the company's code of conduct, and discussing concerns with HR or a higher-level manager to seek clarification on the situation. These steps demonstrate a proactive approach to addressing the ethical dilemma at hand and exploring alternative options to potentially problematic actions.

However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the importance of standing firm on ethical principles and not succumbing to pressure or expectations that could compromise one's integrity. It would be beneficial to explicitly mention the need to consider reporting the situation to relevant authorities if the company's response is unsatisfactory or if unethical behavior persists. This would further strengthen the ethical stance taken in the response.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma, but it could be enhanced by highlighting the significance of upholding ethical standards even in challenging situations and being prepared to take further action if necessary.
