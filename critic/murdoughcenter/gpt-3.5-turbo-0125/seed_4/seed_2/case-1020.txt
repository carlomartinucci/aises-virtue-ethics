The answer provided is specific and practical. It demonstrates a clear understanding of the situation and outlines a course of action based on ethical considerations. By attending the mediation hearing to present technical facts while maintaining the firm's innocence and refusal to participate in any settlement implying fault, the response upholds professional integrity and accountability.

However, to further strengthen the response, it could have included a more proactive approach in seeking legal counsel earlier in the process to better understand the potential consequences and options available in case of threats to the Professional Engineer's license. Additionally, a suggestion to document all communication and evidence related to the situation could have been beneficial for protecting the firm's interests in the long run.

Overall, the response is commendable for its clarity and adherence to ethical principles in a challenging professional scenario.
