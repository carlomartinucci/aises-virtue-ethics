The advice given to Rashid is a practical and actionable solution to the ethical dilemma he is facing. By documenting his concerns in writing and submitting a formal report to both Riley and the building inspector, Rashid is taking proactive steps to address the potential problem with the steel beam coating. This approach allows him to clearly outline the issue, the risks involved, and his attempts to resolve it internally. Seeking a meeting with both Riley and Janis shows Rashid's willingness to collaborate and seek guidance from relevant stakeholders.

However, one potential downside of this approach is that Rashid may face backlash from Riley for escalating the issue. Riley has already shown reluctance to address the problem and may not appreciate Rashid's efforts to involve external parties. Rashid should be prepared for potential consequences and backlash from his superiors.

Overall, the advice given to Rashid is specific, practical, and actionable. It provides a clear course of action for addressing the ethical dilemma while also highlighting the potential challenges he may face. Rashid should proceed with caution and be prepared for any repercussions from his actions.
