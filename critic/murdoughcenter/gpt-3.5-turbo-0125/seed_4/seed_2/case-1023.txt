The answer provided is ethical as it involves addressing the lack of communication and involvement in the project in a professional and constructive manner. By scheduling a meeting with Chuck Cleaver to discuss concerns, seeking clarification on the role, and inquiring about the timeline and contract status, the engineer is taking proactive steps to address the issue.

Positively, the response emphasizes open communication and seeking clarification to address the problem directly. It also encourages escalating the matter if needed, showing a willingness to advocate for the firm's interests. The actionable steps outlined provide a clear path for resolving the situation effectively.

However, one improvement could be to stress the importance of documenting all communication and agreements moving forward to ensure accountability and transparency. Additionally, outlining potential consequences or next steps if the issue is not resolved could strengthen the response.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma and offers practical steps to navigate the situation effectively.
