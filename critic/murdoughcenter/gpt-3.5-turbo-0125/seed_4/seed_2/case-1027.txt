The answer provided is ethical as it promotes transparency and honesty in the business relationship. By explaining the breakdown of the estimated cost and proposing a revised cost estimate based on reused information, it demonstrates a commitment to fair dealing and clear communication with the client. This approach helps in maintaining trust and integrity in the professional relationship.

However, a potential improvement could be to also address the issue of the budget overrun on the Dawson project directly with Bill Broot. It would be beneficial to have an open discussion about the additional costs incurred and explore possible solutions together, such as negotiating a compromise or seeking authorization for the extra work done. This proactive approach can help in resolving past discrepancies and setting a more sustainable path for future projects.

Overall, the proposed course of action is commendable for its transparency and focus on building a mutually beneficial partnership, but there is room for enhancement by addressing the budget overrun issue directly with the client.
