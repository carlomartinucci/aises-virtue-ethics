The answer provided is specific and actionable in advising Turnbuckle on how to handle the situation. By recommending that Turnbuckle gather relevant documentation, consult with a specialized lawyer, respond promptly to the complaint, and cooperate with the state Board, it outlines practical steps for addressing the issue. This approach acknowledges the seriousness of the complaint and the importance of legal compliance in engineering practice.

However, one aspect that could be improved is emphasizing the need for Turnbuckle to take responsibility for not having the required professional engineer's license in the state during the project. While the advice focuses on the legal process and defense strategies, it would be beneficial to also stress the ethical obligation to adhere to licensing requirements and the potential consequences of failing to do so.

Overall, the response provides a solid foundation for addressing the situation, but could be enhanced by underlining the importance of ethical conduct in professional practice.
