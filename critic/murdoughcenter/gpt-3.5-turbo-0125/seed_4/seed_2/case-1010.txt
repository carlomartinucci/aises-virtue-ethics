The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it recommends further investigation into the structural integrity of the building and advises Julie to seek an independent assessment. This aligns with ethical principles of transparency, accountability, and ensuring the safety of the public. By documenting all findings and discussions, Julie can uphold her firm's reputation and demonstrate integrity in her actions.

However, there are some shortcomings in the response. It would have been beneficial to emphasize the urgency of the situation, given the potential risks associated with the rusted clip angles. Immediate action should have been encouraged to prevent any harm or accidents that could arise from the building's structural issues. Additionally, the answer could have suggested that Julie inform relevant authorities or stakeholders about the discovered safety concerns to ensure public safety.

Overall, while the recommendation to conduct further investigation is a step in the right direction, the response could have been more assertive in advocating for prompt action and communication of the risks involved.
