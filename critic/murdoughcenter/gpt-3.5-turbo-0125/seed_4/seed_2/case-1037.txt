The answer provided is ethical in the context of the scenario. By documenting the observed personal relationship between Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert and bringing it to the attention of Fulton Adams, the legal counsel, the consultant is taking a proactive step to ensure that all relevant information is disclosed. This action aligns with the ethical duty to provide complete and accurate information to the legal team, which can impact the credibility and potential biases of the expert witness retained by the plaintiff. It also helps in making informed decisions moving forward in the lawsuit.

However, one potential downside of this action is the risk of getting involved in personal matters that may not directly relate to the technical aspects of the case. While the personal relationship between Cleghorn and Cuthbert could be relevant in assessing potential biases, it may also introduce a level of personal scrutiny that could be perceived as intrusive.

Overall, the provided answer is specific, practical, and actionable. It addresses a specific ethical dilemma within the scenario and provides a clear course of action to handle the situation appropriately.
