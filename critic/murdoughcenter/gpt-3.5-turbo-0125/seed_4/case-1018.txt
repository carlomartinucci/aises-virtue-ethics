The answer provided is ethical as it addresses the issue of plagiarism in a systematic and fair manner. By reviewing the university's academic integrity policy, scheduling individual meetings with the students involved, and considering appropriate consequences based on the policy guidelines, the response demonstrates a commitment to upholding academic standards and fairness.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on educating the students about plagiarism and providing them with an opportunity to explain their actions. This approach promotes transparency and allows for a dialogue that could potentially lead to a better understanding of academic integrity.

However, one area for improvement is the lack of specific details on the consequences that would be imposed on the students found guilty of plagiarism. Providing more clarity on the potential penalties, such as failing the project or receiving a reduced grade for the course, would strengthen the response and ensure consistency in addressing academic misconduct.

Overall, the answer is practical and actionable in handling the plagiarism issue, but could benefit from more explicit details on the consequences to be applied to maintain academic integrity effectively.
