The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of conducting further investigation into the structural integrity of the building and seeking an independent assessment to gain a comprehensive understanding of the risks involved. By documenting all findings and discussions, Julie can maintain transparency and protect her firm's reputation. This approach prioritizes ethical considerations by ensuring that all relevant information is thoroughly examined before making any decisions.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting that Julie should also consider disclosing the potential issue to the buyers or their representative, Sam Goldworthy, to ensure that they are fully informed before finalizing the purchase. This additional step would demonstrate a commitment to transparency and ethical business practices, even if it may have implications for the deal. Julie should prioritize the safety and well-being of others over potential financial gains and business relationships.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable solution to the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario, but it could be enhanced by including a recommendation for disclosure to the buyers to uphold transparency and integrity in business dealings.
