The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it addresses the disappointment felt by the individual and emphasizes the importance of clear communication and respect for the effort put into preparing the proposal. It also seeks to understand the reason behind the decision to go with a competitor and asks for feedback to improve future interactions.

However, the response could be more actionable by being more assertive in seeking compensation for the time and effort spent on preparing the proposal. It would be beneficial to clearly outline the expectation of being paid for the work done, regardless of whether the project moves forward with the individual or not. Additionally, the answer could have included a suggestion to establish clearer terms for future proposals to avoid similar situations.

Overall, the response is a good starting point in addressing the situation, but it could be improved by being more assertive in seeking compensation and setting clearer terms for future engagements.
