The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of transparency and integrity in the project. By reporting the observed incidents to Ethel Hicks, who is the supervisor at the DOT headquarters, the situation can be addressed appropriately. Documenting the incidents with detail also helps in providing a clear account of what was observed. This proactive approach ensures that potential unethical behavior is addressed and prevented from influencing decisions regarding the project and Rod's evaluation.

However, to improve the answer, it would be beneficial to also mention the importance of protecting oneself from potential retaliation or backlash for reporting such incidents. Suggesting that Rod should consider discussing the situation with a trusted mentor or advisor at the university before taking action could provide additional support and guidance in handling the sensitive situation. This would help Rod navigate the potential consequences of his actions while upholding ethical standards.
