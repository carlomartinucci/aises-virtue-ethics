The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of ensuring safety and regulatory compliance in the wastewater treatment plant project. It suggests gathering relevant information, consulting with experts, and communicating concerns to the appropriate parties. This approach prioritizes the well-being of the community and the integrity of the project.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific steps for Reilly to take. For instance, it could suggest seeking a second opinion from a different fire safety expert to confirm compliance, developing a contingency plan in case upgrades are needed, or proposing a timeline for addressing any potential issues. By offering more actionable advice, Reilly would be better equipped to handle the situation effectively and responsibly.
