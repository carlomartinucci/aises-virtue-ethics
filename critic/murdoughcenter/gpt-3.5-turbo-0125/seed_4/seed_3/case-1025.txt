By rejecting the settlement offer and choosing to defend the firm in court, the individual is taking a stand based on the evidence and legal advice available. By ensuring all relevant documentation is presented as evidence, the individual is following a practical approach to support their position.

Positively, the individual is standing firm on their position and upholding their integrity by not accepting responsibility for actions they did not control or advise against. The action taken aligns with the legal and ethical obligation of the firm to defend itself against unjust claims.
