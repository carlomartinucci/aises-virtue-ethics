The answer provided is a practical and actionable solution to the ethical dilemma Rashid faces. By advising Rashid to document his concerns in writing and submit a formal report to both Riley and the building inspector, Janis, it addresses the need for transparency and accountability in addressing potential quality and safety issues on the construction site. Additionally, suggesting that Rashid request a meeting with both parties shows a proactive approach to seeking guidance and resolving the issue collaboratively.

However, one potential drawback of this approach is that it may not fully consider the power dynamics at play, as Riley has already displayed resistance to Rashid's concerns and prioritized project progress over quality. It would have been beneficial to also advise Rashid to seek support from HR or a higher authority within the company if Riley continues to dismiss his concerns, ensuring that Rashid has additional avenues to escalate the issue if needed.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and actionable course of action for Rashid to address the ethical dilemma effectively while emphasizing the importance of transparency, documentation, and seeking guidance from relevant parties.
