The answer provided is specific and actionable. It correctly advises Roger to confront Bill Mason more directly about the ethical concerns related to sharing the draft report with Frank Bullock prematurely. By requesting clarification on the firm's policies and seeking assurance that such incidents will not repeat in the future, Roger can protect the integrity of the firm's work and client relationships. The suggestion to escalate the matter if necessary or seek external guidance shows a proactive approach to addressing ethical dilemmas in the engineering consultancy field.

However, the evaluation could be improved by including more details on potential consequences of not addressing the issue, such as risks to the firm's reputation, client trust, and even legal implications. Additionally, highlighting the importance of documenting the conversation with Bill Mason and any future actions taken would provide a more comprehensive approach to handling ethical concerns in the workplace.
