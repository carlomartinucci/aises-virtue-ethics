The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of prioritizing safety and regulatory compliance in the wastewater treatment plant project. It suggests gathering relevant information, consulting with experts, and communicating concerns to the appropriate parties. This approach demonstrates a commitment to upholding standards and ensuring the well-being of the community.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific steps for Reilly to take. For instance, it could recommend conducting a detailed assessment of the existing room's compliance with NFPA 820, documenting any discrepancies, and proposing a plan of action to address them. Additionally, it could suggest involving the fire code official in a discussion to clarify any uncertainties and ensure a thorough understanding of the requirements.

Overall, the answer offers a solid foundation for ethical decision-making by focusing on safety and compliance, but it could benefit from more detailed and actionable steps to guide Reilly in addressing the potential issue effectively.
