The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes following established policies and guidelines, expressing concerns to the supervisor, and seeking clarity on expectations. By reviewing the design based on existing utility layout and DOT policy, Dianne is ensuring compliance with regulations and ethical standards. Having a conversation with Warren about her concerns shows a commitment to transparency and integrity in decision-making. Prioritizing adherence to policies while addressing potential conflicts with the supervisor demonstrates a balanced approach to ethical decision-making.

However, the evaluation could be improved by providing more specific steps for Dianne to take in the conversation with Warren. For example, she could outline the potential consequences of deviating from DOT policy, discuss alternative solutions to address the water main issue, and seek guidance on how to proceed in a manner that aligns with ethical standards. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of documenting the conversation and any decisions made would further strengthen the ethical approach to the situation.
