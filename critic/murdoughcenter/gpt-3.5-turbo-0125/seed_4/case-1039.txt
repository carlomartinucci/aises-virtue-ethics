The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of addressing the potential environmental and legal risks associated with the mishandling of hazardous waste. By suggesting that Shariq should immediately contact his supervisor, Chuck, and provide all the necessary details, including offering to provide documentation or evidence to support his claims, the answer promotes transparency and accountability in dealing with the situation.

However, the answer could be improved by being more specific about the steps Shariq should take to ensure that the proper authorities are notified about the mishandling of hazardous waste. It would be beneficial to recommend that Shariq should document his communication with Chuck and any subsequent actions taken to address the issue. Additionally, providing guidance on how Shariq can protect himself from potential repercussions for whistleblowing, such as seeking advice from a legal or ethical advisor, would enhance the practicality of the response.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the ethical considerations involved in the scenario and provides a solid foundation for Shariq to address the situation effectively.
