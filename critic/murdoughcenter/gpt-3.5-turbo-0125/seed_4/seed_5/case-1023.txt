The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on addressing the lack of communication and involvement in the project by scheduling a meeting with the design project manager at Moover to express concerns and seek clarification. The response also suggests escalating the issue within Moover if the initial meeting does not resolve the issues, which shows a commitment to ensuring that the firm's contributions are valued appropriately.

To improve the response, it could have included specific steps on how to document the concerns raised during the meeting with Chuck Cleaver, such as sending a follow-up email summarizing the discussion and agreements made. Additionally, offering to collaborate on a revised project plan that clearly outlines the roles and responsibilities of each party could help set clearer expectations moving forward. Finally, suggesting the establishment of regular check-ins or progress updates to maintain open communication channels throughout the project could further strengthen the approach.

Overall, the response demonstrates a proactive and ethical approach to addressing the situation, but adding specific actions to document discussions and establish clear communication channels could enhance the effectiveness of the proposed solution.
