Your answer is specific, practical, and actionable. You correctly state that attending the mediation hearing to present the technical facts is essential. You assert your firm's innocence and lack of financial obligation clearly, which is a good stance to take based on the circumstances. Your consideration of seeking legal advice when faced with threats regarding your professional license shows a prudent approach to protecting your rights. However, it would be beneficial to also consider how to navigate the situation diplomatically to maintain professional relationships while standing your ground firmly. Additionally, outlining potential consequences or next steps if the mediation does not result in a fair resolution could further strengthen your response. Overall, your answer provides a solid foundation for handling the situation effectively.
