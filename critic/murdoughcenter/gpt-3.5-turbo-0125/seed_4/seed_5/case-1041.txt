The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of prioritizing safety for the workers and complying with legal regulations. It suggests that Carlos should firmly communicate his concerns to his boss, document his recommendations, and seek advice from legal experts if necessary. These actions demonstrate a commitment to upholding ethical standards and protecting the well-being of the workers.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how Carlos can navigate the situation practically. For example, it could suggest specific legal resources or authorities that Carlos can consult for advice, or offer strategies on how to negotiate with his boss effectively while still advocating for the safety of the workers.

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma faced by Carlos, but could benefit from more actionable and practical steps to help him navigate the situation effectively.
