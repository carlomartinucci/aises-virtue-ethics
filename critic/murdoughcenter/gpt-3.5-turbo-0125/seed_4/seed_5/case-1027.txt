However, one potential area for improvement could be to also address the issue of the budget overrun on the Dawson project more explicitly. It might be beneficial to discuss with the client the reasons for the overrun, how it will be handled, and how similar situations can be avoided in the future. This additional level of accountability and problem-solving could further strengthen the client's trust and showcase a commitment to continuous improvement.

Overall, the response provides a solid foundation for ethical decision-making in a challenging business scenario, but could benefit from a more comprehensive discussion of addressing past mistakes and ensuring future financial stability.
