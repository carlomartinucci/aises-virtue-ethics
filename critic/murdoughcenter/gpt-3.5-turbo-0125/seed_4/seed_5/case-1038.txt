The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of disclosing the conflict of interest and taking actions to address the situation transparently. By recommending that Daulton should immediately disclose the conflict of interest, inform senior management, and work with legal counsel to determine the best course of action, the response highlights the need to uphold integrity and fairness in business dealings.

However, the evaluation could be improved by providing more specific steps that Daulton should take to address the conflict of interest. For example, the response could have suggested conducting an internal investigation to gather all relevant information, revisiting the project plans to ensure fairness to all parties involved, and implementing measures to prevent similar conflicts from arising in the future. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of maintaining trust and credibility with stakeholders would have added depth to the evaluation.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for ethical decision-making by focusing on transparency and integrity. By offering more specific and actionable steps for Daulton to follow, the response could be further enhanced to ensure a thorough and effective resolution to the conflict of interest.
