The answer provided is ethical as it adheres to the principles of academic integrity and fairness. By reviewing the university's academic integrity policy, scheduling individual meetings with the students involved, presenting the evidence, and determining appropriate consequences based on guidelines, the instructor is taking a proactive and responsible approach to addressing plagiarism.

Positively, the instructor is upholding academic standards, giving students a chance to explain themselves, and following established procedures for handling such situations. The documentation of the meetings and actions taken also ensures transparency and accountability.

However, to further enhance the response, the instructor could consider involving academic integrity officers or a faculty committee in the decision-making process to ensure impartiality and consistency in applying consequences. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of academic integrity and providing resources for students to understand and avoid plagiarism in the future would contribute to a more comprehensive ethical response.
