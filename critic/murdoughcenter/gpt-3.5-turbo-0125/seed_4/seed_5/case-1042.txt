The advice provided to Rashid is a practical and actionable approach to addressing the ethical dilemma he is facing. Documenting his concerns in writing and submitting a formal report to both his boss, Riley, and the building inspector, Janis, shows a proactive effort to address the potential problem with the steel beam coating. By outlining the specific issue, potential risks, and his attempts to address it internally, Rashid is taking responsibility for upholding quality and safety standards on the project.

Involving both Riley and Janis in a meeting to discuss the issue further and seek guidance demonstrates Rashid's willingness to collaborate and seek support from relevant parties. This approach can help ensure that the issue is thoroughly addressed and resolved in a transparent manner.

However, one potential drawback of this advice is the lack of consideration for the potential backlash or negative consequences Rashid may face from Riley for raising the issue. It would be beneficial to also advise Rashid to document any conversations or interactions related to the concern to protect himself in case of any repercussions.

Overall, the advice given to Rashid is a practical and specific course of action that aligns with ethical principles by prioritizing quality and safety in the construction project.
