The answer provided is practical and actionable. It suggests a specific course of action for Topher to take by scheduling a meeting with the design engineers to address the potential adverse impacts on the poorer families living south of the development. This approach shows a proactive effort to find solutions and mitigate the negative effects on the community downstream.

However, the answer could be improved by also recommending that Topher consult with other stakeholders, such as the impacted community members themselves, local advocacy groups, or city council members representing the affected area. By involving a wider range of perspectives and voices in the decision-making process, Topher can ensure that all concerns are heard and taken into account.

Overall, the answer provides a practical step for Topher to take in addressing the ethical dilemma he faces, but it could be strengthened by emphasizing the importance of engaging with a broader range of stakeholders to ensure a more comprehensive and inclusive decision-making process.
