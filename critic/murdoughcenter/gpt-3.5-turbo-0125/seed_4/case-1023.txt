The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing the issue at hand. Scheduling a meeting with Chuck Cleaver to discuss concerns about communication and involvement in the project is a proactive step. Seeking clarification on the role of the firm and requesting detailed explanations show a commitment to resolving the issue professionally.

However, the answer could be improved by including a more assertive approach in addressing the lack of communication and involvement. It would be beneficial to clearly outline expectations for ongoing collaboration and to set specific deliverables to ensure the firm's contributions are valued.

Additionally, the answer could have emphasized the importance of documenting all communications and agreements moving forward to protect the firm's interests and ensure clarity in the working relationship with Moover Design Consultants, Ltd.

Overall, the response is practical and actionable, but it could be enhanced by being more assertive in setting expectations and ensuring clear communication moving forward.
