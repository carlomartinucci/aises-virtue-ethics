The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of honesty, integrity, and prioritizing the well-being of the company. By advising Ben to disclose all the information he knows about Michael's fraudulent activities to the internal investigation team, it promotes accountability and transparency within the organization. Additionally, suggesting that Ben seek guidance from a trusted mentor or HR representative shows a practical approach to navigating the complex situation.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the potential consequences for Ben more explicitly. It would be beneficial to acknowledge the real risks Ben faces in terms of his own position within the company and his relationship with Michael. Providing specific strategies or advice on how Ben can mitigate these risks while still upholding ethical standards would enhance the practicality of the response. Additionally, highlighting the importance of documenting his actions and decisions throughout this process could help protect Ben in case of any future repercussions.
