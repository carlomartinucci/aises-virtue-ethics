The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes finding the best candidates for the committee positions while also considering the applications of all interested students. By reviewing the remaining candidates' applications first and potentially offering them support to meet the committee requirements, the answer demonstrates a fair and inclusive approach. Additionally, reaching out to friends as potential candidates is acceptable as long as they go through the formal application process and are selected based on merit.

To improve the response, it could have included more specific steps on how to provide additional training or support to the remaining candidates to help them meet the committee requirements. This would ensure a more proactive approach to developing the skills of all applicants. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of transparency in the selection process and ensuring that all candidates are treated fairly would further strengthen the ethical decision-making process in this scenario.
