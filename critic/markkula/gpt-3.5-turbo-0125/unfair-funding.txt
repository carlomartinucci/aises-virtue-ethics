The suggested course of action is practical and specific in addressing the issue of potential conflict of interest within the student government funding committee. By implementing a policy that requires members with club leadership roles to recuse themselves from decisions involving their own club's funding requests, Claire can help maintain impartiality and fairness in the allocation process. Furthermore, rotating the leadership of the funding committee can prevent any single individual from exerting undue influence over funding decisions.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more detailed steps on how to implement these policies effectively. For instance, outlining a clear process for identifying conflicts of interest, establishing guidelines for recusal, and setting up a structured rotation schedule for committee leadership would enhance the practicality of the proposed solutions. Additionally, addressing potential challenges or resistance from committee members, including Garret, and offering strategies to overcome them would strengthen the overall effectiveness of the response.
