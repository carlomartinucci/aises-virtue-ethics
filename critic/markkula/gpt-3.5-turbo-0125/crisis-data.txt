The answer provided is a practical and actionable approach to addressing the ethical concerns raised by the data-sharing agreement between Crisis Text Line and Loris.ai. By suggesting a thorough review of the agreement, assessment of user consent transparency, and gathering feedback from stakeholders, the response demonstrates a commitment to understanding the situation comprehensively.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on gathering feedback from both volunteers and users, which shows a willingness to consider the perspectives of those directly impacted by the data-sharing arrangement. This inclusive approach can help in making informed decisions that take into account the concerns of all stakeholders involved.

However, a potential improvement could be to explicitly mention the need for clear communication with all parties involved throughout the review process. Transparent communication is crucial in building trust and ensuring that stakeholders are kept informed about the steps being taken to address the ethical issues at hand.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical concerns surrounding the data-sharing agreement, but could benefit from a stronger emphasis on transparent communication as a key component of the process.
