This answer provides a practical and actionable response to the scenario presented. By recommending a thorough internal investigation to assess the impact on Snapchat's reputation and public image, it shows a proactive approach to addressing the issue. Additionally, suggesting clear communication strategies, including a public statement and steps to prevent similar incidents, demonstrates a commitment to transparency and accountability.

On the positive side, the recommendation of sensitivity training and diversity programs to foster a more inclusive workplace culture is a good step towards rectifying the situation. This can help in rebuilding trust with stakeholders and creating a more respectful environment within the company.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the specific actions that should be taken regarding Evan Spiegel, the CEO. The response focuses more on the company as a whole rather than directly addressing the individual responsible for the controversial emails.
