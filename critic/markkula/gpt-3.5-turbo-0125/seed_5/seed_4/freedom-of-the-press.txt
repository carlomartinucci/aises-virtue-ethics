Carrie's decision to include the topic of the statue and the jokes surrounding it in her video is a good one in terms of reflecting the genuine conversations happening among students on campus. By maintaining authenticity and relevance to her constituency, she is demonstrating a commitment to representing the student body accurately. Additionally, presenting the topic in a light-hearted manner can help mitigate any potential negative impact on donor relationships while still addressing the issue.

However, there are potential downsides to consider. While presenting the topic humorously may soften the impact, there is still a risk of offending the wealthy alumnus who sponsored the statue and other donors who may not appreciate the jokes. This could potentially lead to reduced donations and resources for the student body. Carrie should be prepared to handle any fallout from including the controversial topic in her video and should have a plan in place to address any negative reactions.

In conclusion, Carrie's decision to include the topic in her video is a balanced approach that prioritizes authenticity while also being mindful of potential consequences. To improve her strategy, she should consider ways to address any negative reactions proactively and be prepared to handle any fallout that may arise from her decision.
