The answer provided is a good starting point in addressing the situation with the client. It acknowledges the seriousness of the client's thoughts and behaviors and emphasizes the importance of setting boundaries and discussing the potential consequences of his actions. The suggestion to explore the underlying emotions of jealousy and rejection in a non-judgmental way is a positive step towards understanding the root causes of his behavior. Additionally, the recommendation of healthy coping mechanisms and the assessment of risk are practical and necessary actions to ensure the client's safety.

However, the response could be improved by being more specific in outlining concrete strategies for addressing the client's problematic thoughts and behaviors. Providing more detailed guidance on how to challenge distorted beliefs, practice relaxation techniques, or engage in cognitive-behavioral exercises could enhance the effectiveness of the intervention. Furthermore, the suggestion of couples therapy may not be appropriate in this context, as the client's relationship with Susan does not appear to be romantic in nature. Instead, focusing on individual therapy to address his feelings and develop healthier coping mechanisms would likely be more beneficial.
