The answer provided is practical and actionable in addressing the issue of board engagement within the nonprofit organization. By scheduling individual meetings with each board member, the executive director can gain insight into their perspectives and commitment levels, which is a good approach to understanding the root of the problem. Clearly communicating the organization's goals and the importance of board participation is essential for aligning everyone towards a common vision. Providing specific examples of how each board member can contribute is a positive step in encouraging their active involvement.

However, the answer could be improved by including a more structured plan for follow-up and accountability after the individual meetings. It would be beneficial for the executive director to set measurable goals for board engagement and establish regular check-ins to monitor progress. Additionally, involving the board chair in the process is crucial for ensuring that expectations are clear and that there is a unified effort towards improving board participation.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the issue of board engagement, but could benefit from more detailed steps for implementation and monitoring progress to ensure sustained improvement in the organization's governance structure.
