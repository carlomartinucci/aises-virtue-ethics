This answer provides a practical and actionable approach to the scenario faced by Olivia. It suggests steps for Olivia to reflect on her actions, seek advice from mentors and colleagues, and consider being transparent about her intentions. These steps demonstrate a good understanding of the ethical considerations involved and offer a clear path forward for Olivia to address her concerns.

One positive aspect is the emphasis on seeking advice and feedback from others, which shows a willingness to consider different perspectives and potentially course-correct if needed. The suggestion to prioritize the benefit to the student body over campaign material is also commendable, as it aligns with ethical principles of serving the greater good.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples of how Olivia could adjust her approach or what actions she could take to ensure transparency and integrity. Including concrete steps or strategies would make the advice more actionable and practical for Olivia to follow.

Overall, this answer offers a solid foundation for Olivia to address the ethical dilemma she faces, but could benefit from additional specificity in outlining potential actions she could take to navigate the situation effectively.
