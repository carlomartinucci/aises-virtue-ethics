Your answer is fair and balanced. You correctly acknowledge the limitations of your role as a pastor and emphasize the importance of seeking professional help for John's issues. Your suggestion to encourage John to seek help from a therapist or counselor specializing in depression and substance abuse is a practical and actionable step. You also offer to assist him in finding a suitable professional, which shows your commitment to supporting him through this difficult time. However, you could have also mentioned the option of involving other church members or creating a support group for individuals facing similar challenges. This would provide John with additional resources and a sense of community during his struggles. Overall, your response addresses the immediate concern effectively while leaving room for further support and intervention.
