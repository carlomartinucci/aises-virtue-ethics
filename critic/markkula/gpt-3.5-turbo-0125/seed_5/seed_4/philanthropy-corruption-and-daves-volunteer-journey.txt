The answer provided is ethical as it advises Dave to stop the illegal arrangement with Alex, report the illegal activities of the non-profit managers, and work towards establishing proper procedures for currency exchange to prevent such unethical behavior in the future. 

The suggestion to stop the arrangement with Alex is a good course of action as it aligns with legal and ethical standards. Reporting the illegal activities of the non-profit managers is crucial in holding them accountable for their actions and preventing further misconduct. Furthermore, working with the organization to establish proper procedures for currency exchange demonstrates a commitment to ethical practices and compliance with local laws.

However, the response could be further improved by emphasizing the importance of transparency and accountability in all actions taken by Dave. It would be beneficial to highlight the potential consequences of engaging in illegal activities, not just for Dave and Alex but also for the community and the organization's reputation. Additionally, encouraging Dave to reflect on the broader impact of his actions on economic development and corruption in the region would provide a more holistic perspective on the situation.
