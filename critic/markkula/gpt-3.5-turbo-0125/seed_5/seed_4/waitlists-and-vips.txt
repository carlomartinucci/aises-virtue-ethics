Your response provides a practical and actionable solution to the situation Callie is facing. By suggesting that she quickly inform the senior class of the ticket availability and allocate them on a first-come, first-served basis, you are ensuring fairness in the distribution process. Setting a specific deadline for responses also helps Callie manage the ticket distribution efficiently alongside her other event preparations.

One positive aspect of your advice is that it addresses the issue of fairness by opting for a first-come, first-served approach. This helps prevent any bias or favoritism in ticket allocation. Additionally, setting a deadline for responses allows for a structured and organized process, which is essential given Callie's time constraints.

However, one potential drawback is that the first-come, first-served approach may still result in some students being left out if they are not able to respond quickly. It would have been beneficial to suggest a random selection method to further ensure fairness. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of transparency in the communication process could have strengthened the ethical aspect of the solution.

Overall, your advice is specific, practical, and actionable, providing a reasonable solution to the dilemma at hand. There is room for improvement in terms of ensuring fairness and transparency in the ticket distribution process.
