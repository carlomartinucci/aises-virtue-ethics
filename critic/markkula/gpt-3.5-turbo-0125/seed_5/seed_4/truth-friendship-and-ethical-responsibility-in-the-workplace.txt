It correctly advises Ben to disclose all the information he knows about Michael's fraudulent activities to the company's internal investigation team, highlighting that withholding information could make him complicit in the fraud. The suggestion to provide a detailed account of what he knows, express concerns about potential repercussions, and seek guidance on how to proceed is practical and actionable.
