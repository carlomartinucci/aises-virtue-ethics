The answer provided is a good balance of addressing the concerns raised by the upset senator while also emphasizing the importance of confidentiality in handling sensitive disciplinary matters. By explaining the rationale behind the request for confidentiality and offering a compromise to provide a summary of the decision afterwards, Akira shows a level of transparency and respect for the senator's perspective.

However, the answer could be improved by being more specific about how Akira plans to handle the situation if the senator refuses to leave. It would be beneficial for Akira to have a contingency plan in case the senator insists on staying, such as seeking a consensus among the executive board on how to proceed or consulting with a faculty advisor for guidance.

Overall, the response demonstrates a thoughtful approach to balancing the values of privacy and transparency in a challenging situation, but could benefit from a more detailed plan of action in case of further resistance from the upset senator.
