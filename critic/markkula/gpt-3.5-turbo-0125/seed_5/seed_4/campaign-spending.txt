The answer provided is fairly ethical and practical. By advising James to limit his campaign spending and refrain from using extravagant tactics like renting sports cars, it promotes fairness in the election and reduces the disparity in resources between him and Alix. This approach helps ensure that the competition is based on merits and ideas rather than financial advantage, which is a positive aspect. Additionally, reallocating funds to support initiatives benefiting the student body demonstrates a commitment to serving the student community, which is commendable.

However, the advice could be further improved by suggesting specific alternative ways for James to engage with students and promote his campaign effectively without resorting to excessive spending. Providing concrete examples of cost-effective strategies, such as hosting town hall meetings, engaging in community service projects, or using social media platforms creatively, would enhance the practicality of the recommendation. This would enable James to run a successful and ethical campaign while still reaching out to the student body in meaningful ways.
