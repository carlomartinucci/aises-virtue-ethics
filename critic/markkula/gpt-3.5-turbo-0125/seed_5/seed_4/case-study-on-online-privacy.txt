The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes conducting thorough research, advocating for transparency, collaboration, and offering alternative strategies to address school safety concerns. Conducting research and presenting a comprehensive report to all stakeholders is a proactive approach to ensure informed decision-making. Emphasizing the importance of involving students, parents, and teachers in the decision-making process is commendable as it respects their voices and concerns.

However, one area for improvement is to provide more specific examples of the potential drawbacks and risks associated with facial recognition technology and social media monitoring tools. Including concrete case studies or expert opinions on the negative implications of these technologies would strengthen the argument against their use in educational settings. Additionally, offering more detailed alternative strategies beyond mental health resources and threat assessment programs would enhance the actionable nature of the response.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a balanced consideration of the ethical implications of implementing surveillance technologies in schools and provides a practical approach to addressing school safety concerns through research, transparency, collaboration, and alternative strategies.
