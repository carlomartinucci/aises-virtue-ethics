The suggested solution of implementing a blind review process for funding requests is a practical and actionable approach to address the potential bias and conflict of interest in the funding allocation process. By removing identifying information about the submitting clubs, such as names and logos, the committee members can evaluate proposals based solely on their merit and alignment with funding criteria. This helps ensure fairness and equal treatment for all clubs seeking funding.

The positive aspects of this solution include promoting transparency, objectivity, and fairness in the decision-making process, which are essential in upholding the integrity of the student government's funding system. It also respects Garret's contributions while mitigating the perception of bias due to his dual roles as club president and funding committee head.

However, one potential drawback could be the loss of personal touch or context that might be important in understanding the specific needs and goals of each club. Additionally, there may be challenges in implementing and maintaining a blind review process effectively, especially if there are limited resources or technical constraints.

Overall, the suggested solution strikes a good balance between addressing the ethical dilemma at hand and preserving the positive aspects of the current system. It provides a practical and actionable way for Claire to enhance fairness and impartiality in the funding allocation process.
