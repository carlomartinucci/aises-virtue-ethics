The answer provided is a good starting point for addressing the issue at hand. Meeting individually with the affected senators shows a compassionate approach and allows for a better understanding of their specific circumstances. Exploring alternative solutions and considering potential amendments to the attendance policy demonstrates a willingness to find a practical resolution.

However, to improve the response, it would be beneficial to suggest specific steps to be taken during the meeting with the senators, such as brainstorming creative solutions together and clearly outlining the potential consequences of missing meetings. Additionally, proposing concrete ways for the senators to remain involved in the organization despite their absence would enhance the practicality of the solution.

Overall, the answer is ethical in its consideration of the senators' academic commitments and responsibilities to the student government. By incorporating more actionable steps and specific recommendations, the response could be further strengthened in terms of practicality and effectiveness.
