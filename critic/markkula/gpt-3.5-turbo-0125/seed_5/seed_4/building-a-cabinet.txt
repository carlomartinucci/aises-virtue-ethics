The answer provided is practical and actionable, offering a clear course of action for Marcus to take in selecting his executive cabinet members. By suggesting individual meetings with both the opposing candidates and ardent campaign supporters, the answer acknowledges the importance of assessing commitment, collaboration, and alignment with organizational goals. This approach allows for a fair and inclusive selection process that considers a diverse range of perspectives and strengths.

However, a potential downside is the lack of specific strategies provided for addressing potential resentment from the opposing candidates who were not selected. While the answer acknowledges the risk of spiteful behavior from past experiences, it could benefit from including concrete steps on how Marcus could mitigate this risk, such as transparent communication or ongoing support for those not chosen.

Overall, the answer is comprehensive and provides a solid framework for Marcus to make informed decisions regarding his executive cabinet appointments. Adding more specific tactics to address potential challenges would enhance the answer's effectiveness in navigating the post-election dynamics within the student government organization.
