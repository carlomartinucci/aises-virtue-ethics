The answer provided is a good starting point for handling the situation. It emphasizes the importance of addressing the issue directly with John and expressing concerns about the unprofessional behavior. Encouraging John to remove the video and offering support and guidance are positive steps towards resolving the situation. By choosing a private conversation, Matt shows consideration for John's feelings and reputation.

However, there are a few areas that could be improved upon. Firstly, the answer could have suggested that Matt should also consider discussing the situation with other student government leaders to gather their perspectives and potentially address any broader concerns about underage drinking within the organization. Additionally, while offering support is crucial, it would be beneficial for Matt to clearly communicate the potential consequences of John's actions on the organization and its reputation.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable approach for Matt to address the issue with John while maintaining professionalism and integrity. It could be enhanced by including a more comprehensive strategy for addressing the situation within the broader student government context.
