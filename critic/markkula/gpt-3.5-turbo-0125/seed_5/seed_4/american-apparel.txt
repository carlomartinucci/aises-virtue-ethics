The answer provided is a good starting point for addressing the issues at hand. Conducting a review of the company's policies and procedures related to sexual harassment and workplace conduct is a proactive step in ensuring a safe and respectful work environment. Implementing training and resources to address workplace behavior and culture is also a positive action to take in preventing future incidents.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the specific actions that will be taken to hold individuals accountable for inappropriate behavior, such as providing clear consequences for violating the company's sexual harassment policy. Additionally, more emphasis could be placed on the importance of creating a culture that promotes respect and professionalism, rather than focusing solely on policy review and training.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a commitment to addressing the ethical concerns within the company, but could be strengthened by outlining more specific actions and strategies for preventing and addressing future issues related to workplace conduct.
