The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes maintaining neutrality, integrity, and upholding ethical standards in decision-making. By stepping down from the role in the outdoor club temporarily, Miguel can effectively avoid potential conflicts of interest and demonstrate a commitment to fair evaluation processes. This action also shows a dedication to upholding the reputation of the student government organization and ensuring impartial judgments.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting additional steps Miguel could take during his time away from the outdoor club. For example, he could delegate responsibilities to trusted club members to ensure its continued success in his absence. This would not only maintain the club's momentum but also showcase Miguel's leadership skills in empowering others. Additionally, Miguel could consider seeking guidance or advice from mentors within the student government to navigate this situation effectively and ensure a smooth transition back to the outdoor club in the future.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and actionable solution to the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario, but it could benefit from including more specific steps for Miguel to take during his temporary absence from the club.
