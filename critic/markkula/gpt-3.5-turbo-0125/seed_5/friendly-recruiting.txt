The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing Saumya's dilemma. By first reviewing the applications of the remaining candidates and engaging in discussions with them to assess their potential fit for the committees, the answer demonstrates a fair attempt to consider the existing applicants. Additionally, the suggestion to be transparent with the candidates about the situation and rationale behind considering new applicants shows a commitment to fairness and honesty in the decision-making process.

However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the importance of giving all candidates an equal opportunity to be considered for the positions. While it is understandable that Saumya may feel her friends are the best fit, it is crucial to ensure that all applicants are given fair and equal consideration based on their qualifications and potential contributions to the committees. The answer could have also included a suggestion to involve other members of the student government or relevant stakeholders in the decision-making process to gather diverse perspectives and ensure accountability.

Overall, the answer provides a practical approach to addressing the situation while highlighting the importance of transparency and fairness in the selection process.
