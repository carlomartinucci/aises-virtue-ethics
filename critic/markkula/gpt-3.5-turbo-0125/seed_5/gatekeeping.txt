The answer provided is ethical as it considers the perspectives of all stakeholders involved and aims to find a balanced solution to the issue at hand. Conducting a survey of the student body to understand their preferences shows a commitment to addressing the concerns raised by students. Scheduling a meeting with both student government and faculty representatives to discuss the situation openly and proposing the creation of a separate email list for faculty members are positive steps towards inclusivity and fairness.

The suggestion to work with the IT department to implement an email preference center for students is practical and actionable, as it gives students more control over the emails they receive, potentially reducing the risk of mass unsubscriptions. Establishing clear guidelines and policies for email communication in the long term is a proactive approach to prevent similar issues from arising in the future.

Overall, the answer provides specific steps that Maria can take to address the current situation effectively while also setting up mechanisms for better communication and email management in the future. It demonstrates a thoughtful and strategic approach to balancing the needs of different stakeholders in a complex environment.
