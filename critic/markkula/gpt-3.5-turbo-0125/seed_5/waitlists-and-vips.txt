Your answer provides a practical and actionable solution to Callie's dilemma. By suggesting that she send a quick email to the senior class and allocate the remaining tickets on a first-come, first-served basis, you address the issue of fairness and transparency. Setting a deadline for responses also helps Callie manage the ticket distribution process efficiently.

However, it would have been beneficial to emphasize the importance of ensuring that the email clearly communicates the limited availability of tickets and the need for a prompt response. This would help prevent any misunderstandings or complaints from students who may miss out on the opportunity to attend the event.

Overall, your response offers a clear and specific course of action for Callie to follow, balancing the need to allocate the tickets fairly with her other event preparations.
