The answer provided is specific and actionable, offering practical steps for Carlos to explore alternative funding sources for the retreat. By reaching out to local businesses, alumni, organizing a fundraiser, and looking into grants or scholarships, Carlos can potentially cover the increased cost of the retreat without pulling money from programs that directly benefit the student body. These suggestions demonstrate a proactive approach to problem-solving and show consideration for both the importance of the retreat for student government members and the impact on the student body programs.

However, one potential drawback is that the answer does not address the possibility of scaling back certain aspects of the retreat to reduce costs. While maintaining the coastal location may be important for the overall impact of the retreat, there could be other areas where adjustments could be made to keep the retreat within budget. It would be beneficial for Carlos to also consider potential cost-saving measures within the retreat itself before seeking additional funding sources.

Overall, the answer provides practical steps for Carlos to explore alternative funding options while highlighting the importance of balancing the needs of the student government members with those of the broader student body. By considering a combination of fundraising efforts and potential cost-saving measures, Carlos can work towards a solution that preserves the retreat experience without sacrificing important programs for the student body.
