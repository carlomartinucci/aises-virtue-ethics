The answer provided is practical and actionable in addressing Bryson's situation. Scheduling individual meetings with each staff member to discuss workload and stress levels shows a proactive approach to understanding the team's needs. Encouraging open communication and prioritizing tasks based on feedback demonstrates a supportive leadership style. Reassessing personal responsibilities and adjusting the delegation strategy to maintain a balance between community relations and state-level advocacy is a sensible way to address the issue.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific examples of tasks that could be redistributed among the staff members or adjusted in terms of deadlines. Additionally, outlining a plan for ongoing monitoring and follow-up to ensure that the workload remains manageable for the team would enhance the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Overall, the response offers a solid foundation for addressing the challenges Bryson faces, but could benefit from more detailed action steps and a long-term strategy for maintaining a healthy work environment for the team.
