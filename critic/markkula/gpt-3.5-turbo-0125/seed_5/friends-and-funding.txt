The answer provided is ethical as it suggests that Angela should recuse herself from the vote due to the conflict of interest arising from her close friendship with Emily. By doing so, Angela ensures fairness and transparency in the decision-making process, upholding the principles of integrity within the student government. This action also demonstrates a commitment to treating all campus organizations equally and giving them a fair chance at receiving funding for their events.

However, the answer could be improved by offering a more proactive solution to the issue of the potential lack of a quorum if Angela recuses herself. It would be beneficial to suggest that Angela communicate with other senators to try and find a solution to ensure the vote can proceed smoothly, such as reaching out to absent senators to secure their votes or exploring alternative options to avoid a delay in the decision-making process.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and ethical course of action for Angela to take in this situation, but could be enhanced by including more actionable steps to address the potential challenge of a lack of quorum.
