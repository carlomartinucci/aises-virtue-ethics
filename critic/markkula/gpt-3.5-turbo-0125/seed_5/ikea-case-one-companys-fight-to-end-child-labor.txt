The answer provided is specific, practical, and actionable in addressing the issue of child labor in IKEA's supply chain. It outlines concrete steps such as implementing a supplier auditing program, providing training for suppliers, establishing clear guidelines, collaborating with local authorities, and ensuring transparency and accountability. These actions demonstrate a proactive approach to addressing the ethical concerns raised by the use of child labor in the supply chain.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on education and training for suppliers, which can help raise awareness and promote a culture of ethical labor practices. Additionally, the suggestion to collaborate with local authorities and organizations shows a recognition of the need for external support in addressing complex issues like child labor.

However, one potential drawback is the lack of detail on the specific mechanisms for enforcing compliance with ethical standards among suppliers. It would be beneficial to include more information on the consequences for non-compliance and the mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating supplier practices.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for addressing the issue of child labor in IKEA's supply chain, but could benefit from additional details on enforcement mechanisms to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed actions.
