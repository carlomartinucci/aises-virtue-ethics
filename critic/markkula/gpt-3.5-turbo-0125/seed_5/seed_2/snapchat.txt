The recommended response to the scenario is practical and actionable. Conducting an internal investigation to gauge the impact of the released emails on Snapchat's reputation is a good first step. It shows a proactive approach to understanding the situation better. Involving key stakeholders in this process is crucial for obtaining diverse perspectives and feedback. Developing a clear communication strategy is also essential in managing the crisis effectively and rebuilding trust with the public. Furthermore, proposing sensitivity training and diversity programs demonstrates a commitment to fostering a more inclusive and respectful work environment.

However, the evaluation could be improved by providing more specific details on the actions to be taken within the communication strategy. For instance, outlining the key messages to be conveyed in the public statement or detailing the steps to be implemented in the sensitivity training programs would enhance the practicality of the response. Additionally, emphasizing the need for accountability measures or potential consequences for such behavior within the organization could further strengthen the ethical framework of the proposed actions.
