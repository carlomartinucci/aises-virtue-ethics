The answer provided is ethical as it suggests that Angela should recuse herself from the vote due to the conflict of interest arising from her close friendship with Emily. By doing so, Angela ensures that the decision-making process remains fair and unbiased. This action upholds the principles of transparency and fairness within the student government. It also acknowledges the importance of giving other organizations a fair chance at receiving the funding they need for their events.

However, the answer could be improved by also suggesting that Angela should communicate openly about her decision to recuse herself and the reasons behind it. This would help to maintain trust among her fellow senators and demonstrate her commitment to ethical conduct. Additionally, Angela could offer to provide input or assistance in finding a solution to the lack of quorum issue to prevent unnecessary delays in the decision-making process.

Overall, the answer is practical and actionable, providing a clear course of action for Angela to take in a challenging situation. It demonstrates a good understanding of the ethical considerations at play and offers a sensible solution to address them effectively.
