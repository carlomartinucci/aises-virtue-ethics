This response provides specific and actionable advice to Hana on how to approach covering the student's death in a sensitive and ethical manner. It acknowledges the importance of highlighting the positive aspects of the student's life while also addressing the issue of mental health. The advice to focus on promoting awareness of mental health resources, avoiding graphic details, and including helpline information shows a practical approach to minimizing harm. The emphasis on respect for the family and the student's memory, as well as avoiding sensationalism, is commendable.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how Hana can initiate the important dialogue about healthy coping mechanisms and access to mental health resources on campus. Suggestions on how to interview relevant individuals for the article, how to frame the conversation around mental health, or how to follow up with additional resources in subsequent coverage would enhance the practicality of the advice.

Overall, the response offers a solid foundation for Hana to ethically cover the story, but could benefit from additional specific action steps to ensure the article serves its intended purpose effectively.
