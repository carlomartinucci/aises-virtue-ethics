The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it encourages Matt to address the issue directly with John in a private and constructive manner. This approach prioritizes maintaining professionalism and integrity within the student government organization while also showing concern for John's well-being and future choices.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the potential consequences of John's actions more explicitly. It would be beneficial for Matt to discuss with John the possible negative impacts that the video could have on both individuals and the organization as a whole. Additionally, the answer could suggest that Matt should consider seeking advice from a mentor or advisor within the organization to navigate the situation effectively.

Overall, the answer provides a good starting point for Matt to address the issue, but could be enhanced by including a more thorough discussion of potential consequences and seeking guidance from others in the organization.
