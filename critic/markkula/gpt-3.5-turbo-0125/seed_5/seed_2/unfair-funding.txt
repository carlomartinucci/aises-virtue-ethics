The suggested solution of implementing a blind review process for funding requests is both practical and actionable in Claire's situation. By removing identifying information, such as club names and logos, from the proposals before review, the process would help mitigate any biases or favoritism towards Garret's club. This would ensure that funding decisions are based solely on the merit of the proposals and their alignment with the funding criteria, promoting fairness and equal treatment for all clubs.

On the positive side, this solution addresses the core issue of potential favoritism without directly accusing Garret or limiting the creative ideas of clubs. It upholds the integrity of the funding process and respects Garret's contributions to the student government. Additionally, implementing a blind review process would enhance transparency and trust within the committee, as decisions would be based on objective evaluation criteria.

However, one potential drawback could be the initial adjustment period for committee members to adapt to the blind review process. It may take time for members to fully embrace the new approach and ensure consistency in evaluating proposals. Communication and training may be necessary to support a smooth transition.

Overall, the suggested solution provides a practical and actionable way for Claire to address the fairness issues in the funding process while maintaining a positive relationship with Garret and upholding the integrity of the student government committee.
