Carrie's decision to include the topic of the statue and the jokes surrounding it in her video shows a commendable commitment to reflecting the genuine conversations and sentiments of the student body. By doing so, she ensures that the video remains relevant and authentic to her constituency's concerns and interests. Moreover, her intention to present the topic in a respectful and light-hearted manner demonstrates a level of sensitivity towards potential repercussions on donor relationships and university administration.

However, there are potential risks to consider in Carrie's approach. While aiming for authenticity, she should be cautious not to inadvertently fuel negativity or disrespect towards the university or its donors. It would be beneficial for Carrie to carefully balance the humorous aspect of the topic with a tone that is inclusive and constructive. Additionally, she should be prepared to address any concerns or feedback from university administration or donors regarding the content of the video, ensuring that she is ready to engage in dialogue and explain her choices thoughtfully.

In summary, Carrie's decision to include the statue topic in her video is a positive step towards transparency and authenticity. To enhance the ethical integrity of her actions, she should maintain a balance between humor and respect, be prepared for potential consequences, and prioritize open communication with relevant stakeholders.
