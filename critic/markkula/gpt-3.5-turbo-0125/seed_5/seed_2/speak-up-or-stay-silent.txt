Tre's decision to schedule a private meeting with his supervisor to address the discrepancy in sales reporting is a commendable step. By presenting specific examples and expressing his commitment to integrity, Tre demonstrates a strong ethical stance and a willingness to uphold transparency in the company's practices. Seeking clarification on the reasons behind the misrepresentation and offering to collaborate on resolving the issue shows a proactive approach to addressing concerns.

However, Tre should also consider the potential risks involved, such as backlash or retaliation from superiors or colleagues. It would be beneficial for Tre to document the meeting and any agreed-upon actions to ensure accountability and protect himself in case of adverse outcomes. Seeking support from HR or an external ethics hotline in case of pushback is a wise precaution to safeguard his position while addressing the issue.

Overall, Tre's proposed course of action balances ethical considerations with practical steps to address the problem effectively. By actively engaging with his supervisor and advocating for transparency, Tre demonstrates a commitment to ethical conduct and responsible corporate behavior.
