The answer provided is a good starting point. It suggests a proactive approach by scheduling a meeting with the university administration to address their concerns and explore potential compromises. This shows a willingness to engage in dialogue and find a solution that considers the interests of both parties.

However, the answer could be improved by being more specific about the steps Talia could take during the meeting. For example, she could propose implementing designated smoking areas on campus to address the concerns about student rights while still promoting a healthier environment. Additionally, she could suggest conducting further research or seeking expert advice to better understand the potential legal implications of the smoking ban.

Overall, the answer is practical and actionable, but it could benefit from more detailed suggestions on how Talia can navigate the situation effectively and work towards a resolution that balances the needs of the university administration and the student body.
