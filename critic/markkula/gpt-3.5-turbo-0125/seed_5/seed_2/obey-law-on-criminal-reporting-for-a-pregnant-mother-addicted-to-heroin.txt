The answer provided is quite thorough and takes into consideration the complex ethical and legal issues at play in this scenario. The approach of having a private conversation with the patient to discuss the legal implications of her drug use while emphasizing the priority of her and her baby's health is a good starting point. Offering support and resources, developing a personalized care plan, involving other healthcare professionals, and closely monitoring her progress are all positive steps towards providing comprehensive care.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the potential consequences of not complying with mandatory reporting requirements more explicitly. It would be beneficial to discuss the risks associated with not reporting, such as the possibility of the patient getting a criminal record or child protective services getting involved, in more detail. Additionally, the answer could have included a more robust plan for ensuring the patient's continued well-being and addressing any potential challenges that may arise during her journey towards becoming drug-free.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for handling the situation, but could benefit from more explicit consideration of the risks involved in not complying with legal requirements and a more detailed plan for ongoing support and overcoming potential obstacles.
