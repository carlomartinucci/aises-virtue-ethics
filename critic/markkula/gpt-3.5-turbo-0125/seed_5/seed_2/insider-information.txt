The suggested course of action for Drake to provide general advice to Alex without giving specific details that would guarantee approval is a good approach. By offering guidance on common mistakes to avoid, general strategies for improvement, and pointing Alex towards available resources, Drake is maintaining a level playing field for all student organizations while still providing assistance to his friend.

On the positive side, Drake is showing consideration for fairness by not providing unfair advantages to his friend's club. By offering general advice and directing Alex to resources, Drake is upholding his professional ethics and ensuring transparency in the funding process.

However, a potential downside of this approach is that there may be a risk of Alex feeling disappointed or upset that Drake did not offer more personalized guidance. Drake should communicate clearly with Alex about the limitations of providing detailed feedback to maintain transparency and fairness in the funding process.

Overall, the suggested action strikes a good balance between helping a friend and maintaining ethical standards in overseeing the funding process. Communication with Alex about the boundaries of assistance will be key to managing expectations and ensuring fairness for all student organizations.
