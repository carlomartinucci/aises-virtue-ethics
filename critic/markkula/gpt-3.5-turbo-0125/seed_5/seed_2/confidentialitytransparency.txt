The answer provided is ethical as it balances the values of privacy and transparency in a sensitive manner. By calmly explaining the importance of confidentiality while acknowledging the senator's concerns about transparency, Akira shows empathy and understanding towards both sides of the issue. Asking the senator to leave the room to protect the privacy of the individuals involved in the disciplinary matter is a reasonable decision given the circumstances. Additionally, the commitment to providing a summary of the decision after the meeting aligns with the principle of transparency, fulfilling Akira's campaign promise.

However, to improve the response, Akira could have taken a more proactive approach in addressing the lack of clear guidelines regarding confidentiality in student government proceedings. She could have suggested initiating discussions or drafting bylaws to establish protocols for handling sensitive matters like disciplinary issues in the future. By advocating for the establishment of clear procedures, Akira could prevent similar conflicts from arising in the future and demonstrate a commitment to upholding ethical standards within the student government.

Overall, the answer effectively addresses the immediate situation while maintaining a balance between privacy and transparency. Moving forward, Akira should consider taking steps to formalize procedures to handle such situations more effectively in the future.
