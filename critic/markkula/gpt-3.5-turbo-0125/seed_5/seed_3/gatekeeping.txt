The response provided is practical and action-oriented, offering specific steps that Maria can take to address the issue effectively. Conducting a survey of the student body to understand their preferences shows a proactive approach to gathering important data. Scheduling a meeting with student government and faculty representatives to discuss the situation openly and propose a separate email list for faculty members demonstrates a willingness to engage all stakeholders in finding a solution. Implementing an email preference center to give students more control over the emails they receive is a practical way to address concerns about overwhelming communication.

However, the response could benefit from additional considerations. While creating a separate email list for faculty members is a good idea, it may also lead to potential challenges in managing multiple lists and ensuring that essential information reaches students effectively. Balancing the needs of student organizations and faculty members while maintaining a manageable email volume for students remains a critical aspect that should be addressed further.

Overall, the response provides a solid framework for addressing the issue at hand and offers practical solutions to improve communication strategies within the student government. Additional focus on managing multiple email lists effectively and ensuring equitable access to information for all stakeholders would further enhance the proposed actions.
