Your advice to Callie is practical and actionable. By suggesting that she send out a quick email to the senior class and allocate the remaining tickets on a first-come, first-served basis, you are promoting transparency and fairness in the distribution process. Setting a deadline for responses also helps Callie manage the ticket allocation efficiently alongside her other event preparations. This solution allows Callie to quickly address the issue without creating extra work for herself or showing favoritism towards her friends.

However, it would have been beneficial to also suggest that Callie could seek assistance from other members of the student government or event volunteers to help manage the ticket distribution process. By delegating this task, Callie can ensure that the process is fair and organized while still focusing on her other event responsibilities. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of upholding the integrity of the event and treating all seniors equally, regardless of personal relationships, would have further strengthened the ethical aspect of the solution.
