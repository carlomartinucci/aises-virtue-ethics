Carrie's decision to include the topic of the statue and jokes surrounding it in her video while presenting it in a respectful and light-hearted manner is a good approach. By showcasing a balanced representation of student conversations, she maintains authenticity and reflects the student body's sentiments accurately. This can help the student government stay relevant and connected to the student body.

However, there are potential drawbacks to consider. The video could still be perceived negatively by the university administration and wealthy alumni, which may impact donor relationships and resources for the student body. To address this, Carrie could consider seeking approval or guidance from the university administration before finalizing the video to ensure that it aligns with their expectations and doesn't harm donor relations.

Overall, Carrie's decision is a reasonable compromise between authenticity and sensitivity to potential consequences. By taking steps to mitigate any negative impact on donor relationships, she can navigate the situation responsibly and effectively.
