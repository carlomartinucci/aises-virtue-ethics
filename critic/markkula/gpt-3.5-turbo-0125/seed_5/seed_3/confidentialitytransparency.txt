The answer provided is a good approach to handling the situation as Akira. It acknowledges the senator's concerns about transparency while emphasizing the importance of maintaining confidentiality in sensitive disciplinary matters. By offering to provide a summary of the decision reached after the meeting, it shows a commitment to transparency without compromising the privacy of the individuals involved.

One improvement could be to address the lack of specific bylaws regarding confidentiality in the student government. Akira could mention that while there are no explicit rules in place, it is common practice in many organizations to handle sensitive matters privately to protect the involved parties. This would provide additional context for her request for the senator to leave the room.

Overall, the answer is practical and actionable, providing a balanced approach that considers both transparency and privacy concerns. It effectively navigates the ethical dilemma in this scenario.
