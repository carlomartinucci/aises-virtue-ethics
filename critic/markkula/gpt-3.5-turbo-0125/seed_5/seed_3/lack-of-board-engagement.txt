The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing the issue of board engagement within the nonprofit organization. Scheduling individual meetings with each board member to discuss goals, challenges, and opportunities for growth is a proactive approach. Seeking to understand each board member's perspective and level of commitment shows a willingness to collaborate and address concerns. Clearly communicating the vision for the nonprofit and the importance of active board participation is essential for aligning everyone towards a common goal.

Providing specific examples of how each board member can contribute is a good way to make expectations clear and actionable. Working with the board chair to develop a plan for improving engagement and setting expectations demonstrates a collaborative effort to address the issue collectively.

However, one area for improvement could be to also address the issue of low staff morale directly. Engaging the board in discussions on staff morale and involving them in finding solutions could foster a sense of shared responsibility and unity within the organization.

Overall, the answer provided is a solid plan for addressing the issue of board engagement within the nonprofit organization, with a focus on communication, collaboration, and setting clear expectations for board members.
