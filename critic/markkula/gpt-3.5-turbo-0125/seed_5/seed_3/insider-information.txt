Your response provides a practical and actionable solution to Drake's dilemma. By offering general advice and guidance without giving specific details that would guarantee approval, Drake can maintain a level playing field for all student organizations seeking funding. This approach demonstrates a good balance between helping a friend and upholding professional ethics.

However, it would be beneficial to emphasize the importance of transparency in this situation. Drake should clearly communicate to Alex the limitations of the advice he can provide and ensure that Alex understands the need to maintain fairness in the funding process. Additionally, Drake could encourage Alex to utilize the available resources and seek feedback from other sources to further improve the proposal.

Overall, your answer strikes a good balance between helping a friend and maintaining professional ethics, but could be strengthened by highlighting the importance of clear communication and transparency in the process.
