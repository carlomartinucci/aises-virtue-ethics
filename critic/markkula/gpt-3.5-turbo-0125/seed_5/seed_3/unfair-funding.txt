The suggested course of action to implement a blind review process for funding requests is a practical and actionable solution to address the potential bias in the funding approval process within the student government committee. By removing identifying information about the submitting clubs, the proposal aims to ensure that funding decisions are based solely on the merit of the proposals, promoting fairness and equal treatment for all clubs.

The good in this suggestion lies in its proactive approach to mitigating bias and ensuring a more equitable distribution of funds. By focusing on the merit of the proposals rather than personal affiliations, the blind review process can help uphold the integrity of the funding process and foster trust among all clubs involved.

However, one potential downside of this approach could be the initial resistance or confusion from committee members, including Garret, who may be accustomed to the current process. It would be essential for Claire to effectively communicate the reasons behind implementing the blind review process and provide necessary training and support to ensure its successful implementation.

Overall, the proposed solution is specific, actionable, and addresses the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario by promoting fairness and impartiality in the funding allocation process. It also acknowledges the contributions of individuals like Garret while striving to create a more just system for all clubs involved.
