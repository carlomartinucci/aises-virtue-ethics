The answer provided is ethical as it recommends honesty, transparency, and seeking guidance from senior members of the student government. By suggesting that Grace have an open conversation about her situation and explore potential solutions to mitigate any negative impact on the organization, the answer promotes ethical behavior in handling the dilemma.

Positively, the suggestion to communicate openly with senior members shows a commitment to integrity and accountability. Seeking guidance demonstrates a willingness to consider the perspectives and needs of others in the organization. Addressing the issue proactively reflects a sense of responsibility to uphold the organization's standards and values.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific suggestions on how Grace could address the potential impact of her early graduation on the organization's operations. For instance, offering concrete proposals for finding a temporary replacement or outlining a plan for transitioning responsibilities could enhance the practicality of the advice given.

Overall, the response is ethical in its emphasis on transparency and seeking guidance, but could benefit from additional actionable steps to address the situation effectively.
