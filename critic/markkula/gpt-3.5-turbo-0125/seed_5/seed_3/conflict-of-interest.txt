The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest, maintaining neutrality, and upholding ethical standards. By stepping down from the role in the outdoor club temporarily, Miguel can demonstrate his commitment to fairness and prioritize the integrity of the decision-making process within the student government.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting additional actions that Miguel could take during his time away from the outdoor club. For example, Miguel could use this opportunity to mentor new leaders within the club, stay informed about the club's activities, and offer guidance from a distance. This way, he can still contribute positively to the growth of the club while avoiding any conflicts of interest.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and actionable solution to the dilemma faced by Miguel, but could benefit from including more specific suggestions for how he can continue to support the club during his absence.
