The answer provided is a practical and actionable approach to the scenario. It acknowledges the complexities of the situation, such as the potential backlash Matt may face for addressing the issue. By suggesting that Matt privately address John first and express his concerns, the answer demonstrates a diplomatic and respectful way to handle the matter. It also emphasizes the importance of maintaining professionalism and integrity within the organization.

However, the answer could be improved by also recommending that Matt consider seeking guidance from a higher authority within the student government or university, such as a faculty advisor, if the situation escalates or if John fails to address the issue. Involving a neutral third party could provide additional support for Matt and ensure that the matter is handled appropriately.

Overall, the answer provides a good starting point for Matt to address the situation with John while also highlighting the importance of upholding the organization's values.
