The answer provided is practical and action-oriented. By suggesting a review of privacy policies and legal agreements, consulting with legal experts, and establishing clear data-sharing agreements, the responder is taking concrete steps to address the ethical concerns raised by the scenario. This approach demonstrates a commitment to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, as well as safeguarding the privacy of individuals whose data is being collected. The emphasis on collaboration with city leaders and legal experts is a positive aspect of the response, as it shows a willingness to engage with relevant stakeholders in addressing the issue.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific details on what the data-sharing agreement might entail. For example, outlining specific provisions for data anonymization, encryption, and limitations on the use of the footage by the technology company would enhance the completeness of the proposed solution. Additionally, discussing potential mechanisms for oversight and accountability in monitoring the use of the data could further strengthen the response.

Overall, the answer is a good starting point for addressing the ethical implications of the scenario, but it could benefit from more detailed and specific recommendations for ensuring the protection of individual privacy rights and data security.
