The answer provided is quite comprehensive and offers a good course of action in addressing the concerning behavior exhibited by the 22-year-old man. It is positive that the psychologist acknowledges the seriousness of the situation and expresses concern about the thoughts of stalking. Exploring the underlying emotions and discussing healthy coping mechanisms is a practical approach to help the individual manage his feelings of jealousy and rejection. 

However, the response could be improved by emphasizing the importance of setting clear boundaries with the client regarding acceptable and unacceptable behavior. It would be beneficial to explicitly state that any form of stalking or harassment is not permissible and should be addressed immediately. Additionally, the answer could have included a more direct discussion about the potential harm his actions could cause to Susan and her boyfriend, highlighting the impact of his behavior on others. 

Overall, the answer is ethical in its approach to addressing the client's troubling thoughts and feelings. By incorporating clearer boundaries and a stronger emphasis on the potential harm caused by his actions, the response could be even more effective in guiding the client towards healthier behaviors and relationships.
