The answer provided is ethical because it emphasizes transparency, seeking diverse perspectives, and open communication with the editor. By advising Nadia to disclose her involvement and connections, she can maintain credibility as a fair and objective reporter. Encouraging her to consider diverse viewpoints ensures a balanced portrayal of the issue. Suggesting a discussion with her editor shows a proactive approach to addressing potential biases.
