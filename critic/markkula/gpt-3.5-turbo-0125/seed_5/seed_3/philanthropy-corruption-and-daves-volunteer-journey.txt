The answer provided is ethical in advising Dave to stop the arrangement with Alex, report the illegal activities of the non-profit managers, and work towards establishing proper procedures for currency exchange. This response addresses the core ethical concerns in the scenario by emphasizing the importance of accountability, adherence to local laws, and preventing further unethical behavior.

However, a more detailed evaluation could include practical steps for Dave to take in order to implement the advice given. For instance, Dave should document all evidence of the illegal activities, consult with legal experts on the best course of action, and ensure that the transition to a legal currency exchange process is smooth and transparent. Communicating openly with his organization and seeking guidance on how to proceed effectively would also be beneficial in resolving the ethical dilemma.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical issues at hand, but could benefit from additional actionable steps for Dave to follow in order to navigate the complex situation with integrity and accountability.
