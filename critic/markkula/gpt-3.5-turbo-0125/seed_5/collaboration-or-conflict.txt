The answer provided is specific and actionable, offering a practical approach to addressing the issue at hand. Scheduling a face-to-face meeting with Alanna to express concerns and propose a clear plan of action with specific deadlines and responsibilities is a good step towards resolving the communication breakdown. Involving advisors to mediate the situation if needed shows a willingness to seek outside help to find a resolution.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the potential consequences of not collaborating effectively more explicitly. It would also be beneficial to emphasize the importance of maintaining a positive relationship between student government and RHA for future collaborations, rather than solely focusing on the success of the upcoming event.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for Josh to address the situation with Alanna and work towards a solution that benefits both organizations and the student body.
