The answer provided is a good starting point in addressing the complex ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. The obstetrician's approach of having a private conversation with the patient to discuss the legal implications of her drug use, offering support and resources, and involving other healthcare professionals demonstrates a patient-centered and collaborative approach to care.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on prioritizing the health and well-being of both the patient and her baby. By providing information about available treatment programs and working with the patient to develop a personalized care plan, the obstetrician is taking proactive steps to support the patient in her journey towards becoming drug-free.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the potential consequences of not complying with mandatory reporting laws more explicitly. It is important to clearly communicate the legal requirements and the possible outcomes of non-compliance to ensure that the patient fully understands the situation.

Additionally, while involving other healthcare professionals is crucial, the answer could benefit from specifying how the obstetrician plans to coordinate care with addiction specialists and social workers. Clear communication and collaboration among the healthcare team are essential to provide comprehensive and effective support to the patient.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for addressing the ethical dilemma, but could be strengthened by enhancing the clarity of communication regarding legal requirements and detailing the coordination of care with other healthcare professionals.
