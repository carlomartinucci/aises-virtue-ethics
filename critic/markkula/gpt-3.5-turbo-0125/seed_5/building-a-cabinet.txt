The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing Marcus's dilemma. By suggesting individual meetings with both the opposing candidates and the ardent campaign supporters, it promotes a fair and inclusive selection process. The emphasis on gauging intentions, commitment, and collaboration willingness shows a proactive approach to mitigating potential issues of resentment or lack of contribution. The suggestion to assess compatibility with organizational goals and team dynamics is a good way to ensure a cohesive executive cabinet.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more concrete steps on how to handle situations where candidates may not meet the desired criteria during the meetings. Offering guidance on how to navigate difficult conversations or how to communicate decisions effectively would enhance the practicality of the response. Additionally, addressing potential challenges that may arise from balancing experience with enthusiasm in the cabinet could further strengthen the answer.

Overall, the answer is a good starting point for Marcus to navigate his decision-making process, but it could benefit from more detailed strategies on handling various outcomes of the meetings and ensuring effective communication throughout the selection process.
