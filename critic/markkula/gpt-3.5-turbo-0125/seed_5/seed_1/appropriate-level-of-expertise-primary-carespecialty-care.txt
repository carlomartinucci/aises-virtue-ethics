The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes Peter's well-being and emphasizes the importance of seeking specialized care for a potential mental health condition. It acknowledges the limits of the primary care physician's expertise and the necessity of involving a psychiatrist in diagnosing and treating conditions like bipolar disorder. The response also maintains a compassionate and supportive tone towards Peter, ensuring that the patient feels heard and understood throughout the process.

To improve the answer, it could be more specific by mentioning potential consequences of untreated or misdiagnosed bipolar disorder, such as worsening symptoms, impaired functioning, or potential risks of self-harm. Providing concrete examples of how a psychiatrist's expertise can lead to a more accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan would further strengthen the response. Additionally, offering to follow up with Peter after the referral to a psychiatrist, and discussing a collaborative approach to his overall care with both professionals involved, would enhance the practicality of the answer.
