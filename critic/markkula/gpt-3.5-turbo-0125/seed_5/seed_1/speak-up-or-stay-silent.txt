Tre's decision to schedule a private meeting with his supervisor to address the discrepancy in sales reporting is a commendable step towards upholding ethical standards within the company. By presenting specific examples and expressing his concerns about potential misleading information being presented to investors, Tre demonstrates a commitment to integrity and transparency.

Moreover, by offering to work collaboratively with his supervisor to rectify the issue and seeking clarification on the reasons behind the misreporting, Tre shows a proactive approach to resolving the situation. Documenting the meeting and any agreed-upon actions is a practical way to ensure accountability and track progress towards correcting the reporting practices.

However, Tre should also consider the potential risks involved, particularly given the current atmosphere of tech layoffs and his status as a new employee. While it's important to prioritize ethical behavior, Tre must be prepared for any pushback or retaliation he may face for speaking up. Seeking guidance from HR or an external ethics hotline can provide him with additional support and protection in such circumstances.

Overall, Tre's proposed course of action is a responsible and actionable approach to addressing the ethical dilemma he has identified, balancing the importance of integrity with the need to navigate potential job-related concerns sensitively.
