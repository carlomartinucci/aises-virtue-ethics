Your response is highly specific and actionable, which is commendable. By proposing to conduct research, collaborate with experts, and develop new resources, you are addressing the issue directly and proposing a practical solution. Your plan to provide clear guidelines and work with the university's sexual assault prevention center shows a proactive approach to supporting neurodiverse students in understanding and practicing consent.

However, to improve this response further, you could consider emphasizing the importance of inclusivity and diversity in the development process. Ensure that the new resources are not only specific to neurodiverse individuals but also considerate of various forms of neurodiversity within this group. Additionally, you could include a plan for ongoing evaluation and feedback mechanisms to continuously improve and adapt the resources based on the needs and experiences of neurodiverse students.

Overall, your answer is detailed, practical, and action-oriented, but enhancing it with a focus on inclusivity and continuous improvement would make it even stronger and more comprehensive.
