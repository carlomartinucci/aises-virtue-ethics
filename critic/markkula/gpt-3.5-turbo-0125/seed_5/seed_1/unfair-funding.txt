The suggested course of action to implement a blind review process for funding requests is a practical and specific solution to address the potential bias in the funding allocation process. By removing identifying information from the proposals, such as club names and logos, the committee members can evaluate each request based solely on its merits, without being influenced by personal affiliations or biases.

This approach promotes fairness and equal treatment for all clubs seeking funding, which is commendable. It also respects Garret's contributions to the student government by ensuring that his club's proposals are judged based on their own merits, rather than his involvement.

However, there are potential drawbacks to consider. Implementing a blind review process may require additional time and resources to anonymize the proposals, which could be a logistical challenge. Additionally, there is a possibility that committee members may still be able to identify the club behind a proposal based on its content or style, which could undermine the effectiveness of the blind review process.

Overall, the suggestion to implement a blind review process is a practical and actionable solution that addresses the issue of potential bias in funding allocation. It is important for Claire to carefully consider the implementation details and potential challenges to ensure the effectiveness of this approach in promoting fair and equitable distribution of funds.
