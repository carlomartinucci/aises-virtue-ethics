The answer provided is both practical and actionable in addressing the scenario presented. By suggesting to meet with the affected senators individually to understand their perspectives and explore alternative solutions, the response shows empathy towards the senators' predicament. Reviewing the attendance policy and proposing an amendment to allow for exceptions in extenuating circumstances demonstrates a proactive approach to finding a solution. Additionally, the suggestion to involve the senators in alternative ways to contribute to the organization shows a willingness to accommodate their academic commitments while still involving them in the Senate's work.

One point of improvement could be to consider potential consequences of amending the attendance policy, such as ensuring that any changes maintain the accountability and effectiveness of the student government. It would also be beneficial to communicate transparently with the rest of the Senate about the proposed solutions and involve them in the decision-making process to promote fairness and inclusivity.

Overall, the response offers a comprehensive and practical approach to reconciling the problem, taking into account the needs of the senators, the organization's policies, and the importance of maintaining a balance between academic and extracurricular commitments.
