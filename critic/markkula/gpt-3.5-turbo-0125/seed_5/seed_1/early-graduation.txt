The answer provided is ethical as it promotes transparency, open communication, and seeking guidance from senior members of the student government. By advising Grace to have a conversation about her situation and potential impact on her commitment, the answer encourages her to consider the organization's needs and explore possible solutions collaboratively.

Positives:
1. Promotes transparency: Encourages Grace to openly discuss her situation with senior members.
2. Considers organization's needs: Advises Grace to seek guidance on how to proceed in a way that minimizes the impact on the student government.
3. Advocates for integrity: Emphasizes the importance of navigating the situation with honesty and consideration for others.

Areas for improvement:
1. Lack of specific solutions: While the answer suggests discussing options with senior members, it could be more actionable by providing specific suggestions on how Grace could fulfill her commitment or alternatives to consider.
2. Future planning: Could include advice on how Grace can plan for a smooth transition if she decides to run for the senior class senator position and graduate early.

Overall, the answer offers a good foundation for Grace to address her dilemma in an ethical manner, but could be enhanced by providing more detailed and practical solutions for her to consider.
