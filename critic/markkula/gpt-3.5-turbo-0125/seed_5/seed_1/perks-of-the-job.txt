Your answer is specific and actionable, which is great. You proposed a solution that addresses the issue directly, offering to help find alternative solutions and suggesting ways to reduce costs. By emphasizing the importance of ethical conduct and accountability while acknowledging Julia's contributions, you strike a good balance. However, it would have been beneficial to also address the potential consequences of Julia's actions on the organization and its programs, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the situation. Additionally, including a plan for follow-up or escalation if Julia does not change her behavior would have strengthened your response. Overall, your approach is practical and clear, providing a good starting point for addressing the ethical dilemma.
