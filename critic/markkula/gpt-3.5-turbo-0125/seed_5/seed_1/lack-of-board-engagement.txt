The answer provided is a practical and specific approach to addressing the issue of board engagement within the nonprofit organization. By scheduling individual meetings with each board member, the executive director can gain insights into their perspectives and level of commitment, which is a good way to establish better communication and understanding. The proposal to clearly communicate the organization's vision and the importance of board participation is essential for aligning everyone towards common goals. Additionally, providing specific examples of how each board member can contribute can help motivate and engage them more effectively.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting more concrete actions to hold board members accountable for their commitments, such as setting measurable goals for attendance and participation. It would also be beneficial to establish a system for regular check-ins to monitor progress and provide ongoing support to ensure sustained engagement. While the proposed plan is a good starting point, adding these elements would enhance its effectiveness in driving positive change within the organization.
