Your answer is ethical as it focuses on the well-being of John and acknowledges the limitations of your own expertise in addressing his issues. By encouraging him to seek professional help and offering support, you are taking a responsible approach to the situation.

Here are some actionable points for improvement:

1. **Positive**: You show genuine concern for John's well-being and prioritize his mental and physical health.
2. **Positive**: By recommending professional help and offering to assist him in finding a suitable therapist or counselor, you are providing concrete steps for him to take.
3. **Negative**: While you suggest professional help, you could also consider reaching out to other resources within the community, such as local mental health services or support groups, to provide additional options for John.
4. **Negative**: It would be beneficial to discuss with John the potential consequences of not seeking help, such as the impact on his family and his own health, to further emphasize the importance of taking action.

Overall, your response is a good starting point, but providing more specific alternatives and discussing potential consequences could enhance the effectiveness of your support for John in this challenging situation.
