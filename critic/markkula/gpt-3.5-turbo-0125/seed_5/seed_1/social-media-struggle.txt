The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes addressing the issue privately and offering support to the individual involved. By choosing to handle the situation discreetly and with a focus on helping John understand the implications of his actions, Matt shows consideration for both his friend's well-being and the reputation of the student government organization.

On the positive side, the answer promotes open communication and attempts to resolve the issue in a constructive manner. It recognizes the importance of maintaining professionalism and integrity within the organization while also showing empathy towards John's situation.

However, a potential drawback could be the lack of consideration for the potential consequences of John's actions. While offering support and guidance is commendable, there is a risk that John may not take the concerns seriously or may continue engaging in similar behavior. Additionally, the answer does not address the possibility of escalating the issue if John does not respond positively to the private conversation.

In conclusion, the answer provides a good starting point for addressing the situation, but it could be strengthened by including a plan for further action if John does not cooperate or if the behavior persists. It is important for Matt to be prepared to take additional steps to uphold the organization's standards if necessary.
