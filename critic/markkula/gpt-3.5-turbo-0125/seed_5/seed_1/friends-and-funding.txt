The answer is ethical as it suggests that Angela should recuse herself from the vote to avoid the conflict of interest presented by her close friendship with Emily. By doing so, she ensures fairness in the decision-making process and upholds principles of transparency and integrity within the student government. It acknowledges the importance of maintaining unbiased decision-making, even if it means potentially delaying the vote to maintain fairness.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific strategies for Angela to handle the situation effectively. For example, she could suggest an alternative solution to ensure the vote proceeds without her involvement, such as appointing a temporary proxy or finding a way to reach a quorum despite the flu-related absences. By offering actionable steps to address the conflict of interest while also mitigating the potential delay, the answer would be even more practical and comprehensive.
