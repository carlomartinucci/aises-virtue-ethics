The answer provided is ethical as it balances the importance of maintaining confidentiality in sensitive disciplinary matters with the value of transparency in governance. By explaining the rationale behind the decision to the upset senator and assuring him of a summary of the decision afterward, Akira shows empathy and understanding. However, the answer could be further improved by explicitly addressing the lack of specific bylaws regarding confidentiality in the student government and proposing a follow-up action to establish clear protocols for handling such situations in the future. This would enhance the ethical approach by not only addressing the current issue but also working towards preventing similar conflicts in the future through proper governance procedures.
