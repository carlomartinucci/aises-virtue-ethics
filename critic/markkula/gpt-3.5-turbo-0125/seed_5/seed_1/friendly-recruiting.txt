The answer provided is mostly ethical as it prioritizes selecting the best candidates for the committees while also maintaining fairness and transparency in the selection process. The recommendation to first review the existing applicants and then have discussions with them to assess their fit for the committees is a good approach. Additionally, being transparent with the candidates about the situation and rationale behind considering new applicants is commendable.

However, there are some potential ethical concerns in the answer. While it is important to consider new applicants if the current candidates are not the best fit, there is a risk of bias towards Saumya's friends. It is crucial to ensure that the selection process remains fair and unbiased, and that personal relationships do not unduly influence the decision-making process. Saumya should be mindful of this potential conflict of interest and take steps to mitigate it.

To improve the answer, Saumya could consider implementing a more formalized process for selecting candidates, such as involving a diverse panel of evaluators or setting clear criteria for selection. This would help ensure that decisions are based on merit and qualifications rather than personal relationships. Additionally, providing feedback to the current candidates on why they were not selected and offering them opportunities for improvement or future involvement would enhance the fairness of the process.
