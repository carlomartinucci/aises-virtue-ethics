The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of honesty, integrity, and accountability in the workplace. By advising Ben to disclose all the information he knows about Michael's fraudulent activities to the company's internal investigation team, it promotes transparency and upholding the company's values.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the potential risks and challenges Ben may face more explicitly. It would be beneficial to advise Ben to document all conversations and evidence related to the fraudulent scheme to protect himself in case of any backlash. Additionally, suggesting that Ben seek legal advice or consult with HR to understand his rights and protections in this situation would provide more practical guidance.

Furthermore, while the answer rightly prioritizes professional responsibilities over personal relationships, it could acknowledge the emotional difficulty Ben may experience in navigating this situation. Providing guidance on how Ben can manage his emotions and potential fallout from his decision would enhance the answer's practicality.

Overall, the answer is sound in its ethical stance but could be strengthened by offering more specific advice on mitigating risks and managing personal implications.
