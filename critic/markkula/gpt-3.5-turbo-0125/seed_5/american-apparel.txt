The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it addresses the need to review and improve the company's policies and procedures related to sexual harassment and workplace conduct. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining a safe and respectful work environment for all employees, which aligns with ethical principles of promoting a positive workplace culture.

However, the answer could be improved by being more specific and actionable.
