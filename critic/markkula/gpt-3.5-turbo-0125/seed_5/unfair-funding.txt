The suggested solution of implementing a blind review process for funding requests is a practical and actionable approach to address the potential bias in the funding allocation process. By removing identifying information about the submitting clubs, the committee members, including Garret, can evaluate proposals based solely on their merit and alignment with funding criteria. This helps ensure fairness and equal treatment for all clubs seeking funding.

One positive aspect of this solution is that it directly tackles the issue of potential bias without singling out Garret or his club. It maintains the integrity of the process and respects Garret's contributions to the student government. Additionally, it provides a systematic way to address the problem and create a more equitable funding distribution system.

However, one potential drawback of this solution is that it may not completely eliminate bias, as committee members may still be able to identify certain clubs based on the content of the proposals. Additionally, implementing a blind review process may require additional time and resources to anonymize the proposals effectively.

Overall, the suggested solution is a practical and actionable step towards promoting fairness in the funding allocation process. It addresses the issue at hand while also considering the relationships and dynamics within the student government committee.
