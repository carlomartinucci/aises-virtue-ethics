The answer provided is a practical and actionable approach to addressing the issue of board engagement within the nonprofit organization. By scheduling individual meetings with each board member, the executive director can gain insights into their perspectives and commitment levels, which is a good way to build relationships and foster understanding. Clearly communicating the vision for the nonprofit and outlining specific ways for board members to contribute is also a positive step towards increasing engagement and involvement.

However, the answer could be improved by including a more concrete plan for follow-up and accountability. Setting specific goals and timelines for board members to increase their participation, as well as establishing consequences for continued lack of engagement, would make the approach more effective. Additionally, involving the board chair in developing and implementing the plan is crucial for ensuring buy-in and support from leadership.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the issue of board engagement, but could benefit from more detailed steps for implementation and monitoring progress.
