Your response is specific and actionable, which is commendable. By scheduling a private meeting with Julia, you are addressing the issue directly and offering solutions to help her rectify the situation. Your emphasis on the importance of ethical conduct and accountability is also a positive aspect of your response.

However, one potential drawback is that you may need to consider the power dynamics at play in this situation. Julia is a senior member of student government, and Anthony is a freshman. This power imbalance could make it challenging for Anthony to confront Julia about her actions. It would be beneficial to acknowledge this dynamic in your approach and consider ways to navigate it effectively.

Overall, your response provides a practical course of action that addresses the ethical issue at hand while also offering support and guidance to Julia. Just be mindful of the power dynamics and ensure that your approach takes them into account.
