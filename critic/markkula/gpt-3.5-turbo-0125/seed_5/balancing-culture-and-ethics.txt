The answer provided is ethical as it addresses the dilemma faced by Ben in a balanced manner. It acknowledges the positive aspects of the business development in providing additional income for families while also expressing concerns about child labor and the potential risks it poses to the children's well-being. The suggestion to explore alternative ways to support the families economically without involving children in risky labor practices is a practical and actionable step towards addressing the issue.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific recommendations on what those alternative ways could be. For example, Ben could propose setting up a scholarship fund for the children to ensure they have access to education while still supporting their families financially. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of local laws and international conventions against child labor could strengthen the argument for finding alternative solutions.

Overall, the answer is ethical, balanced, and provides a good starting point for addressing the issue of child labor in the village.
