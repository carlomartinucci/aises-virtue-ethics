The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being of John and encourages him to seek professional help for his mental health struggles. The response is specific and actionable, as it suggests connecting John with a therapist or counselor specializing in depression and substance abuse, emphasizing the importance of seeking help and offering support in finding a suitable professional. It also acknowledges the limitations of the pastor's role in addressing clinical depression and substance abuse.

However, to improve the response further, it could include more concrete steps on how to approach the conversation with John about seeking professional help. For example, the pastor could offer to accompany John to his first therapy session or provide resources for local therapists. Additionally, the answer could address the potential barriers John may face in seeking help, such as stigma or financial concerns, and offer solutions or referrals to overcome these obstacles.

Overall, the answer is ethical, specific, and practical in guiding the pastor on how to support John effectively during this challenging time.
