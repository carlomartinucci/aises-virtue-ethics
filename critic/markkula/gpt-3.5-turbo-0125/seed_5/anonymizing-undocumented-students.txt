The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes Adam's safety and well-being, which is crucial in this sensitive situation. By suggesting that Jessica explain the risks to Adam and offering alternatives to protect his identity, such as using a pseudonym or a generic description, the answer shows a practical approach to balancing journalistic integrity with ethical considerations. It also emphasizes the importance of accurately representing Adam's story, even if his name is not disclosed, which is commendable.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how Jessica can navigate the potential backlash from readers regarding the use of anonymous sources. Offering strategies on how to address accusations of political bias or suspicions related to anonymity would enhance the practicality of the response. Additionally, suggesting ways for Jessica to maintain transparency and credibility in her reporting while respecting Adam's request for anonymity would further strengthen the ethical approach in this scenario.
