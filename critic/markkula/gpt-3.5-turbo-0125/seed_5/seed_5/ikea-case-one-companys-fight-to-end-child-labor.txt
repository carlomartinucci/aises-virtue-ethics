The answer provided is specific and actionable in addressing the issue of child labor in IKEA's supply chain. By implementing a comprehensive supplier auditing program, providing training for suppliers, establishing clear guidelines, collaborating with local authorities, and promoting transparency and accountability, IKEA can effectively combat child labor and improve labor conditions in its supply chain.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on education and training for suppliers, which can help raise awareness and ensure compliance with ethical standards. Additionally, the suggestion to collaborate with local authorities and organizations demonstrates a proactive approach in addressing the issue at the grassroots level. The call for transparency and accountability is also commendable as it promotes trust and integrity in IKEA's sourcing practices.

However, a potential drawback could be the lack of detail on the specific measures for monitoring and enforcing compliance with ethical standards. Providing more specific examples of how audits will be conducted, what the training sessions will entail, and how guidelines will be enforced could strengthen the overall plan.

Overall, the answer provides a practical roadmap for IKEA to address the issue of child labor in its supply chain, but could benefit from more detailed strategies for implementation and monitoring to ensure effectiveness and sustainability.
