Evaluation:

Good:
- The answer demonstrates a proactive approach by suggesting a review of privacy policies and legal agreements.
- Consulting with legal experts shows a commitment to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations.
- The emphasis on establishing a clear data-sharing agreement with strict guidelines prioritizes privacy protection.

Bad:
- The answer lacks specifics on how potential privacy risks would be mitigated beyond legal compliance.
- It could benefit from addressing potential ethical concerns related to mass surveillance and the use of emotion-recognition AI.
- There is no mention of engaging with the public or seeking input from constituents on such a significant decision.

Overall, while the answer shows a good initial step in addressing the situation through legal compliance and data-sharing agreements, it could be improved by providing more specific actions on privacy protection, ethical considerations, and public engagement.
