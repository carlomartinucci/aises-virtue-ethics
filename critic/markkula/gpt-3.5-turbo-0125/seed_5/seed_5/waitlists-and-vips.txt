Your answer provides a practical and specific solution to Callie's dilemma. By advising her to send a quick email to the senior class and allocate the remaining tickets on a first-come, first-served basis, you ensure fairness in the distribution process. Setting a deadline for responses also helps Callie manage the ticket allocation efficiently. This solution addresses the issue at hand effectively and allows Callie to maintain integrity and fairness in her decision-making.

However, it would have been beneficial to acknowledge the potential disappointment of Callie's friends who may not receive tickets through this method. Providing guidance on how Callie can navigate this personal aspect while prioritizing fairness could have added depth to your response. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of transparency in communication to avoid any perception of favoritism would have further strengthened your answer. Overall, your response offers a practical and actionable solution to the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario.
