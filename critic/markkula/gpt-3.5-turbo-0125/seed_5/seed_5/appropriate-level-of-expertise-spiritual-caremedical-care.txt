Your response is practical and actionable. You correctly identified the need for John to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor specialized in depression and substance abuse. You offered support and guidance in finding the appropriate help for John, which is commendable. Additionally, you emphasized the importance of addressing mental and physical health during challenging times and reassured John that seeking help is a sign of strength.

However, a potential improvement could be to address the immediate risk of alcohol relapse more directly. Given John's history of alcoholism and recent relapse, it may be crucial to involve a trusted member of the church community or a support group to provide additional assistance and accountability in managing his alcohol use. This collaborative approach could offer John more comprehensive support in dealing with his challenges.

Overall, your response is ethical, practical, and empathetic, but considering the urgency of John's situation, a more proactive approach in managing his alcohol relapse risk could further enhance the support you provide to him.
