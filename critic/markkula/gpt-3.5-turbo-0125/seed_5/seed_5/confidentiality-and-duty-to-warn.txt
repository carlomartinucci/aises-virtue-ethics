The answer provided is mostly ethical and offers a good course of action in addressing the concerning behavior exhibited by the client. It appropriately addresses the client's problematic thoughts of stalking and emphasizes the potential legal and ethical implications of such actions. The response also focuses on exploring the underlying emotions of jealousy and rejection in a non-judgmental manner, which is essential in understanding the root cause of the client's behavior. 

Furthermore, the suggestion of discussing healthy coping mechanisms and assessing the risk of harm to the client or others demonstrates a proactive approach to managing the situation. The recommendation for couples therapy to address unresolved feelings towards Susan and to work on building healthy relationships in the future is also constructive.

However, the response could benefit from additional emphasis on the importance of setting clear boundaries with the client regarding acceptable behavior and the consequences of crossing those boundaries. It would be beneficial to explicitly state the need for ongoing monitoring of the client's thoughts and behaviors related to the situation with Susan, as well as the importance of seeking immediate help if there are any signs of escalating behavior. Additionally, ensuring the client understands the importance of respecting others' boundaries and seeking consent in all interactions should be highlighted.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the client's problematic behavior, but could be strengthened by incorporating more specific strategies for managing the situation effectively.
