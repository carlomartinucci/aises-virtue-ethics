It emphasizes a step-by-step approach, starting with a review of the current candidates and then moving on to discussing their suitability with them individually. It also suggests being transparent with all parties involved, including the current candidates and potential new applicants who are friends of Saumya. This approach allows for a fair consideration of all candidates while prioritizing the best fit for the committees.
