The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing Bryson's situation. It suggests concrete steps for Bryson to take, such as scheduling individual meetings with his staff to assess their workload and stress levels, encouraging open communication, and potentially redistributing tasks to alleviate pressure. The answer also emphasizes the importance of reassessing Bryson's own responsibilities and ensuring that essential tasks are not being neglected.
