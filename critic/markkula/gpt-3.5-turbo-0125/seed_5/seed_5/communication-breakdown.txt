You also provide specific suggestions, such as scheduling a meeting with the Vice Provost to discuss the off-campus Greek life thefts and exploring alternative channels if necessary. These actions can help Derek address the immediate issue while maintaining a constructive relationship with the administration.

Overall, your response offers concrete steps for Derek to navigate his challenging situation effectively. It focuses on practical solutions that can help him uphold the interests of the student body while managing his relationship with the administration. Good job!
