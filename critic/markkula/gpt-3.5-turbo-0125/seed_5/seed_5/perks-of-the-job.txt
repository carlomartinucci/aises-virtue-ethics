The answer provided is specific, practical, and actionable. Scheduling a private meeting with Julia to address the issue directly shows a proactive approach to resolving the situation. By emphasizing the importance of following organizational policies and offering to help find alternative solutions, the answer demonstrates a willingness to support Julia while upholding ethical standards. The suggestion to collaborate on cost-saving measures also shows a constructive mindset towards improving resource allocation.

However, it could be improved by addressing the potential consequences of Julia's actions on the organization more explicitly. Highlighting the impact of misusing resources on student programs and the overall efficiency of the student government could further strengthen the argument for ethical behavior. Additionally, setting clear boundaries and expectations for future conduct could help prevent similar incidents in the future.

Overall, this response provides a solid framework for addressing the ethical dilemma and promoting accountability within the organization.
