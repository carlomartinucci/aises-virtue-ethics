The answer provided is a practical and actionable approach to the situation. By suggesting that Matt privately address his concerns with John, it shows a level of respect for their relationship and allows for a chance to resolve the issue without immediately going to higher authorities. Encouraging John to remove the video and offering support demonstrates a willingness to help him make better choices while also emphasizing the importance of professionalism and integrity within the organization.

However, the answer could be improved by considering the potential consequences of John's actions beyond just the organization's reputation. It would be beneficial to also address the legal implications of underage drinking and the potential harm it could cause to John and others. Additionally, the answer could suggest that Matt should be prepared for different responses from John and have a plan in place for how to proceed if John does not take the concerns seriously.

Overall, the answer provides a good starting point for Matt to address the situation while maintaining professionalism and respect for his colleague.
