The answer provided is specific and actionable, which is good. The approach of scheduling individual meetings with each board member to understand their perspectives and level of commitment is a positive step towards addressing the issue. Clearly communicating the vision, providing examples of contribution, and working with the board chair to develop a plan for improvement are all practical strategies to enhance board engagement.

However, a potential downside could be the time and effort required to schedule individual meetings with all 20 board members, especially considering the executive director's other responsibilities. Additionally, the answer could have included a more concrete plan for holding board members accountable for their attendance and participation, such as setting specific targets or implementing consequences for non-engagement.

Overall, the answer is a good starting point for addressing the lack of board engagement, but it could benefit from further detail on time management and accountability measures to ensure effectiveness in improving board participation.
