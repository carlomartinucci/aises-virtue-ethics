The suggested solution of implementing a blind review process for funding requests within the student government committee is a practical and actionable approach to address the potential bias caused by personal affiliations within the committee. By removing identifying information about the submitting clubs, such as names and logos, the process can indeed help ensure that proposals are evaluated solely on their merit and alignment with funding criteria.

This solution promotes fairness and equal treatment for all clubs seeking funding, which is essential for maintaining transparency and integrity in the decision-making process. It also respects Garret's contributions to the student government while addressing the issue of potential bias without directly targeting him.

However, it is important to consider potential challenges or unintended consequences that may arise from implementing a blind review process. There may be logistical challenges in ensuring the anonymity of proposals, and some committee members, including Garret, may need additional training or guidance on how to evaluate proposals without personal biases.

Overall, the suggested solution is a solid step towards improving the fairness of the funding allocation process within the student government committee. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of the blind review process would be necessary to ensure its effectiveness and address any issues that may arise during its implementation.
