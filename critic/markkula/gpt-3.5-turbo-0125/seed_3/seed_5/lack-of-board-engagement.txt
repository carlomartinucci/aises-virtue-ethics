The answer provided is specific and actionable in addressing the issue of lack of board engagement within the nonprofit organization. By scheduling individual meetings with each board member to discuss their level of engagement and commitment, the executive director is taking a proactive approach to identify the root causes of the problem. Emphasizing the importance of active participation and seeking feedback from board members are positive steps towards improving communication and fostering a sense of ownership among the board.

Proposing the creation of a board development committee to enhance board involvement and effectiveness, as well as organizing regular training sessions, demonstrates a strategic approach to addressing the issue in the long term. These initiatives can help educate board members on their roles and responsibilities, providing them with the necessary tools to contribute meaningfully to the organization's mission.

However, the answer could be further improved by specifying the timeline for implementing these actions and setting measurable goals to track progress. It would also be beneficial to address the issue of staff morale directly by outlining strategies to boost morale in parallel with improving board engagement.

Overall, the answer is a good starting point for addressing the lack of board engagement within the nonprofit, but it could be enhanced by providing more detailed steps, timelines, and goals for implementation.
