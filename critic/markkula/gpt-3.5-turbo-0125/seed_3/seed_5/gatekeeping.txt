This response offers a practical and actionable approach to the situation faced by Maria. By convening a meeting with key stakeholders and proposing a solution that encourages collaboration between faculty members and student organizations, it addresses the concerns raised by both parties. The suggestion to include faculty information in the weekly newsletter is a good way to ensure that important information reaches students without overwhelming them with additional emails.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific details on how to implement this solution effectively. For instance, outlining a clear process for faculty members to submit their information for inclusion in the newsletter would enhance the practicality of the proposed solution. Additionally, considering potential challenges or objections that may arise during the meeting and offering strategies to address them would further strengthen the response.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a thoughtful and balanced approach to resolving the issue at hand, but it could benefit from more specific guidance on implementation to ensure successful outcomes.
