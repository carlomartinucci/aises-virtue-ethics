The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes fairness and transparency in the funding process. By declining Alex's request for personal guidance and emphasizing the availability of online resources for all student organizations, Drake avoids the appearance of favoritism and ensures equal opportunities for all clubs and societies. However, a potential downside is that Alex may feel disappointed or upset by the refusal of personal assistance, impacting their relationship. To address this, Drake could consider offering additional support sessions or workshops for all student organizations to enhance their understanding of the funding process, thus maintaining fairness while providing valuable guidance to all.

Overall, the response is practical and actionable, offering a clear course of action for Drake to follow in a challenging situation. It effectively balances the need for fairness and professionalism in the funding process while also considering the emotional impact on Alex.
