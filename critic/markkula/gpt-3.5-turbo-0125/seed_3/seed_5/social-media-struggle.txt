The answer provided is a practical and actionable approach to the situation. It acknowledges the complexity of the dilemma Matt faces and suggests a course of action that balances professional integrity with maintaining relationships within the organization. By recommending that Matt privately address his concerns with John and offer support rather than immediately resorting to public disclosure, the answer shows an understanding of the potential consequences of Matt's actions.

However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the importance of confidentiality in the conversation between Matt and John. It should be made clear that Matt should handle the situation discreetly to protect John's privacy and reputation within the organization. Additionally, the answer could benefit from including a suggestion for Matt to seek guidance from a mentor or advisor within the student government to navigate the ethical dilemma more effectively.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the situation, but could be enhanced by incorporating elements of confidentiality and seeking guidance from others in the organization.
