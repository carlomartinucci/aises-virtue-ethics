The answer provided is a practical and actionable response to Bryson's situation. It acknowledges the importance of addressing the workload and stress levels of the student staff members, as well as prioritizing key responsibilities outlined in Bryson's position description. By scheduling individual meetings with each staff member to openly communicate concerns and seek input, the answer demonstrates a proactive approach to understanding the current situation.

Furthermore, the suggestion to reassess the distribution of responsibilities within the team and potentially adjust workload balances shows a willingness to adapt and find solutions to alleviate the staff members' stress. The emphasis on collaboration and support, as well as considering adjustments like deadlines, training, or seeking additional assistance, reflects a thoughtful and empathetic approach to leadership.

However, while the answer provides a solid framework for addressing the immediate issues within Bryson's team, it could benefit from a clearer plan for ensuring that all critical responsibilities, particularly those related to state-level advocacy, are effectively managed in the long term. It would be beneficial to outline specific strategies for balancing community relations work with state-level duties and ensuring that key tasks are not neglected in the future.

Overall, the answer offers a strong foundation for addressing the challenges Bryson faces, but could be enhanced by providing more detailed steps for maintaining a sustainable workload balance and effectively fulfilling all aspects of the External Relations Vice President role.
