Your answer provides a thoughtful and considerate approach to handling the complex situation faced by Mary as the CFO of the family business. By suggesting open communication, empathy, and exploring alternative solutions, you demonstrate a commitment to addressing the issue while considering the interests of all stakeholders. 

One positive aspect of your answer is the emphasis on having a candid conversation with Donald to understand his perspective better, which is crucial for resolving conflicts within the family business. Additionally, proposing compromises, such as negotiating a buyout amount and hiring external professionals to manage the building, shows a willingness to find creative solutions that balance financial considerations with family harmony.

However, one area for improvement is the need for more specific steps or actions that Mary can take to implement these suggestions. For instance, providing detailed strategies for facilitating discussions, conducting negotiations, or seeking professional advice would enhance the practicality of your response.

Overall, your answer offers a solid foundation for addressing the ethical considerations in Mary's decision-making process, but additional specificity in outlining actionable steps would further strengthen the effectiveness of your approach.
