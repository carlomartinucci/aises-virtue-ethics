The response provided is ethical in the sense that it prioritizes the protection of Joshua's privacy and the need for a fair and confidential discussion on the matter. Asking the senator to leave in this context aligns with the principles of privacy and due process.

However, there are some potential drawbacks to this approach. By asking the senator to leave without clear bylaws or guidelines in place, Akira may face backlash from the senator and other members of the student government. This could be perceived as a lack of transparency or fairness in decision-making. It also raises questions about the consistency of applying rules and procedures within the student government.

To improve the response, Akira could consider addressing the lack of specific bylaws or guidelines regarding confidentiality in disciplinary matters. She could suggest establishing clear procedures for handling sensitive issues to ensure transparency and fairness while also respecting individuals' privacy rights. Communicating a commitment to upholding these standards in a transparent and accountable manner would help build trust among all members of the student government.
