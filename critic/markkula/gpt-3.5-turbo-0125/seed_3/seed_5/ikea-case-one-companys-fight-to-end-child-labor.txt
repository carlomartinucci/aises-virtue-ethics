The answer provided is specific, practical, and actionable, outlining clear steps that IKEA can take to address the issue of child labor in its supply chain. The actions suggested, such as conducting thorough supplier reviews, implementing new audit processes, developing a code of conduct, providing training for staff, collaborating with NGOs, and establishing reporting mechanisms, all aim to tackle the root cause of the problem effectively.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on proactive measures to prevent child labor by setting up monitoring systems and raising awareness among staff and suppliers. The collaboration with local organizations shows a commitment to working with experts in the field to address the issue effectively.

However, one potential drawback could be the lack of specific details on how IKEA plans to enforce consequences for non-compliance with the code of conduct. It would be beneficial to include specific penalties or corrective actions that will be taken if violations are found during audits.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for IKEA to address the issue of child labor in its supply chain, but adding more details on enforcement mechanisms could further strengthen the proposed actions.
