The answer provided is ethical as it acknowledges the conflict of interest Miguel is facing and proposes practical steps to address it. The suggestion to have transparent conversations with both the outdoor club and Associated Students shows a commitment to honesty and open communication. Additionally, the recommendation to temporarily step back from the club during the petitioning process demonstrates a willingness to prioritize neutrality and fairness in decision-making.

On the positive side, the answer emphasizes the importance of maintaining integrity and seeking guidance from mentors or advisors within the organization. This shows a proactive approach to handling the situation responsibly and ethically.

However, one area for improvement could be to provide more specific details on how Miguel can effectively communicate his decision to step back from the club to its members. Offering guidance on how to navigate potential pushback or concerns from club members could further strengthen the action plan.

Overall, the answer offers a solid foundation for addressing the conflict of interest, but could benefit from more specific strategies for managing potential challenges that may arise from stepping back from the club temporarily.
