Given the concerns about bias in the healthcare system, it would be beneficial to explore ways to advocate for fair and equal treatment for all patients, including those from minority communities like Jerome's. By actively working towards addressing systemic issues, you can contribute to a more just and equitable treatment environment for all individuals seeking help for addiction.

Overall, your response is practical and actionable, providing concrete steps to support Jerome in accessing the care he needs while also hinting at the importance of addressing broader societal issues related to addiction treatment.
