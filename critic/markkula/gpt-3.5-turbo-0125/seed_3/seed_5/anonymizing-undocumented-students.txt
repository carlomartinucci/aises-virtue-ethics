Your response is practical and actionable, providing clear steps for Jessica to follow in handling the situation. You correctly prioritize Adam's safety and well-being, which is commendable. By explaining the importance of honoring his request for anonymity and offering suggestions to maintain transparency and credibility in her article, you address the ethical dilemma effectively.

One area for improvement could be to suggest that Jessica have a conversation with her editor, Anthony, about the situation to ensure he is aware of the decision to withhold Adam's name. This can help prevent any potential conflicts or misunderstandings later on.

Overall, your response offers a balanced approach to handling the ethical dilemma, focusing on the well-being of the source while also considering journalistic integrity. Good job!
