The answer provided is a good starting point for addressing the situation with John. It emphasizes the importance of expressing concern for his well-being and offering support. The suggestion to have a one-on-one conversation outside of the regular sessions shows a personal touch and dedication to helping John. Encouraging him to seek professional help and offering to assist in finding resources is a proactive step towards addressing his depression and potential relapse.

However, the answer could be improved by being more specific about the type of resources available for John. Providing concrete options for affordable therapy or support groups in the local area would make the assistance more actionable. Additionally, setting specific follow-up plans, such as regular check-ins and continued support, would demonstrate a commitment to helping John through his challenges effectively. Overall, the response is ethical but could benefit from more specificity and practicality in offering assistance to John.
