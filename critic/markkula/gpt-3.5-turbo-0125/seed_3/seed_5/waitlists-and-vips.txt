Your response is specific and actionable, providing a clear course of action for addressing the situation. By acknowledging the mistake in data entry and offering the extra tickets on a first-come, first-served basis to the entire senior class, you promote fairness and inclusivity. Setting a time frame for responses also helps manage the process efficiently.

One possible improvement could be to delegate the task of managing responses to a trusted colleague or volunteer to alleviate some of the burden on Callie, allowing her to focus on other event preparations. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of transparency in the communication to the senior class would further enhance the ethical handling of the situation.

Overall, your response effectively addresses the ethical dilemma at hand by prioritizing fairness and inclusivity, while also considering the practical implications of the decision. Great job!
