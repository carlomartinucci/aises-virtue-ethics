The answer provided is practical and actionable in addressing Tyler's dilemma. By recommending that Tyler prioritize connecting with his constituents through various means such as setting up office hours, organizing focus groups, and building relationships with student organizations, the answer offers concrete steps for Tyler to take. These actions would indeed help Tyler better understand and represent the changing needs of his constituency.

For instance, providing guidance on time management techniques, delegation of tasks, or ways to streamline committee projects could help Tyler maintain a balance without sacrificing his effectiveness in either role. Additionally, addressing potential concerns about how to communicate his decision to prioritize constituency work to his fellow Senators and manage perceptions of his productivity would enhance the answer's completeness.

Overall, the answer is a good starting point for Tyler to address his dilemma, but it could benefit from more specific and detailed recommendations to help him navigate the situation more effectively.
