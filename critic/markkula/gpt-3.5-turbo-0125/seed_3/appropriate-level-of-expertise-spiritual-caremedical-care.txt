The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being of John and offers practical steps to support him. The action of scheduling a separate meeting with John to express concern and encourage seeking professional help shows a proactive approach to addressing his mental health and addiction issues. The suggestion to research resources and offer ongoing support demonstrates a commitment to assisting John in finding the help he needs.

However, the response could be improved by being more specific in outlining the steps to take in finding professional help for John. Providing concrete information on local therapists, counselors, or support groups, as well as offering to accompany John to his first appointment, would enhance the practicality of the advice given. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of confidentiality and privacy in seeking help could address John's concerns about the risks of attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

Overall, the answer is a good starting point in addressing John's complex situation, but it could benefit from more detailed guidance on how to connect him with the necessary support services effectively.
