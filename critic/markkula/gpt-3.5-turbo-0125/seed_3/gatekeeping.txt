The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing the scenario faced by Maria. By convening a meeting with key stakeholders and proposing a solution that encourages collaboration between faculty members and student organizations, Maria is taking proactive steps to address the issue at hand. This approach acknowledges the concerns raised by students about email volume while also recognizing the value of the current system in promoting student events.

One positive aspect of this response is the emphasis on finding a balance between meeting the needs of faculty members and ensuring that students are not overwhelmed with excessive emails. By suggesting alternative communication channels and promoting collaboration, Maria is demonstrating a willingness to explore creative solutions to the problem.

However, one potential drawback of this approach is that it may not fully address the demands of faculty members who are seeking direct access to the email list reserved for student events. While including faculty information in the weekly newsletter is a step in the right direction, some faculty members may still prefer to have their emails sent individually to students.

Overall, this response provides a practical and actionable plan for Maria to navigate the situation effectively. By fostering collaboration, exploring alternative communication channels, and maintaining the current balance of email distribution, Maria can work towards a solution that meets the needs of both students and faculty members while mitigating the risk of email overload.
