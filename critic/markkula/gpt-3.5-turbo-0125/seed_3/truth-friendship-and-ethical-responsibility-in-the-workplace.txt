The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the integrity of the company and upholding ethical standards. By advising Ben to disclose all the information he knows about Michael's fraudulent activities to the internal investigation team, it emphasizes the importance of honesty and accountability in a professional setting. This action aligns with ethical principles of transparency and responsibility, ensuring that appropriate measures are taken to address the financial harm caused by the fraudulent scheme.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the potential consequences for Ben more explicitly. It would be beneficial to acknowledge the real risks Ben faces, such as jeopardizing his friendship with Michael and potentially facing backlash or termination from the company. Providing guidance on how Ben can navigate these challenges while still upholding ethical standards would make the answer more actionable and practical.

Overall, the answer effectively highlights the importance of ethical decision-making in this scenario and provides a clear course of action for Ben to follow. By enhancing the discussion on potential consequences and offering practical advice on how to address them, the answer could be even more comprehensive and actionable.
