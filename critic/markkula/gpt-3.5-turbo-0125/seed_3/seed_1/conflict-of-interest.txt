The answer provided is a practical and actionable solution to Miguel's dilemma. It emphasizes transparency, communication, and taking concrete steps to address the conflict of interest. By directly addressing the issue with both the outdoor club and Associated Students, temporarily stepping back from the club, and seeking guidance from colleagues, Miguel can navigate the situation with integrity and professionalism.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on open communication. By having a direct and transparent conversation with both organizations, Miguel can ensure that his concerns are understood and can work towards finding a solution together. Additionally, the suggestion to temporarily step back from the club shows a willingness to prioritize the integrity of the decision-making process within Associated Students.

On the other hand, one potential drawback of the answer is that it does not provide specific strategies for managing the transition period while stepping back from the outdoor club. It would be beneficial to outline how Miguel can ensure a smooth handover of responsibilities and maintain a level of involvement that allows him to stay informed without being directly involved in decision-making.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and actionable plan for Miguel to address the conflict of interest and uphold his integrity in both organizations. By following through with these steps and seeking support as needed, Miguel can navigate this challenging situation effectively.
