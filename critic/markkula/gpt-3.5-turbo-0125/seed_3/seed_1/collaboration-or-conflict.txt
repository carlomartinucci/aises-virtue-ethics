The answer provided demonstrates a practical and actionable approach to addressing the situation. It emphasizes the importance of open communication, understanding the other party's perspective, and working towards a collaborative solution. The suggestion to schedule a face-to-face meeting shows a proactive effort to address the issues directly. Additionally, proposing a clear plan of action with specific deadlines and responsibilities is a good way to ensure progress is made efficiently.

However, the answer could benefit from including a contingency plan in case Alanna remains uncooperative or unresponsive during the meeting. It would be helpful to have a backup strategy in place to ensure the event planning can proceed smoothly even if collaboration with RHA does not materialize. Additionally, addressing the potential impact on future relationships between student government and RHA, and how to mitigate any damage that may occur, would further enhance the answer's completeness.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the situation effectively, but could be strengthened by considering potential obstacles and preparing alternative solutions.
