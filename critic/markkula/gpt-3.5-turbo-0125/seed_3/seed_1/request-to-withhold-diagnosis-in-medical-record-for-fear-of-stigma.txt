This answer provides a good foundation for addressing the situation with Sophie. It demonstrates empathy and a willingness to educate her on the importance of mental health disclosure in a medical profession. The suggestion to seek therapy in addition to medication is also a positive step towards comprehensive care.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the following points:
- It is important to explicitly mention the ethical implications of prescribing medication for an off-label use and not documenting the true reason for the prescription. This could have legal and ethical consequences for both Sophie and the physician.
- The response should include a discussion about the potential risks of not disclosing her mental health history, especially in the context of applying for medical licensure.
- It would be beneficial to explore alternative solutions or accommodations that could support Sophie through her struggles, such as adjusting her workload or seeking additional support from the medical school.

Overall, the answer provides a good starting point but could be enhanced by addressing these additional considerations to ensure a more comprehensive and ethical approach to the situation.
