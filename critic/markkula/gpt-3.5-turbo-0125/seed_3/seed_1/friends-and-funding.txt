Your answer is ethical in advising Angela to recuse herself from the vote due to her conflict of interest. It emphasizes the importance of upholding integrity and transparency in the decision-making process, which is commendable. By suggesting that Angela communicate her decision to the other senators, you promote accountability within the student senate.

To improve your response further, you could provide specific steps or guidelines for Angela to follow when recusing herself, such as formally stating the conflict of interest, stepping away from the discussion during the vote, and potentially seeking guidance on how to handle similar situations in the future. These actionable suggestions would enhance the practicality of your advice.
