The answer provided is detailed and specific, outlining a course of action that involves discussing the legal implications with the patient, emphasizing the importance of her commitment to becoming drug-free, offering support in accessing services, developing a treatment plan, encouraging voluntary entry into an inpatient program, closely monitoring progress, and providing additional resources and support as needed. 

Positively, the answer acknowledges the patient's autonomy and well-being, aiming for a compassionate approach to care. It also highlights the importance of balancing legal obligations with patient care and maximizing positive outcomes for both the patient and her baby.

However, one area for improvement could be to explicitly address the potential risks and consequences of mandated reporting, criminal charges, and involvement of child protective services in more depth. Providing a more comprehensive discussion on how to navigate these risks while ensuring the best possible outcome for the patient and her baby could enhance the answer's practicality.

Overall, the answer is ethical in its approach, but could benefit from further exploration of the potential risks involved and specific strategies to mitigate them while supporting the patient effectively.
