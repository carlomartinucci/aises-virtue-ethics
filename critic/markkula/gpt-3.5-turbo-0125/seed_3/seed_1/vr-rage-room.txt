Your answer is specific and actionable, providing clear steps on how to handle the situation ethically. By emphasizing the importance of enforcing the app's terms of service, monitoring user-generated content, and taking prompt action when violations occur, you demonstrate a commitment to maintaining a safe and positive environment within the app.

However, one potential improvement could be to include proactive measures, such as implementing filters or algorithms to flag potentially harmful content before it is published. This could help prevent inappropriate content from being uploaded in the first place, complementing your reactive approach to enforcement.

Overall, your response effectively addresses the ethical considerations in the scenario and provides practical steps to uphold the app's guidelines while fostering a positive user experience. Well done!
