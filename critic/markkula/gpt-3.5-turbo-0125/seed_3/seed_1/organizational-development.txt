The answer provided is practical and actionable, offering specific steps for Carlos to consider before making a decision. By suggesting alternative funding options such as reaching out to sponsors or organizing a fundraising event, the answer encourages Carlos to explore creative solutions to mitigate the increased costs of the retreat. Additionally, the recommendation to transparently communicate the situation to the student body and seek their input is a good way to involve stakeholders in the decision-making process.

However, the answer could be improved by delving deeper into the potential consequences of each proposed solution. For example, it would be beneficial to discuss the potential impact on the student government's reputation if they are unable to hold the retreat, as well as the long-term benefits of investing in leadership development through the retreat. Providing more detailed analysis of the trade-offs involved in each option would make the answer even more robust.
