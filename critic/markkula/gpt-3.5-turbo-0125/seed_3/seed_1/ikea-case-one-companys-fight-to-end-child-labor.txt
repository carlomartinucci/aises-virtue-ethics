The provided answer is detailed and specific, offering a practical course of action for addressing the issue of child labor in IKEA's supply chain. The actions suggested, such as conducting supplier reviews, implementing a new audit process, developing a code of conduct, providing training, collaborating with NGOs, and establishing a reporting mechanism, are all actionable steps that can help tackle the problem effectively.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on thorough review and monitoring of suppliers, as well as the focus on education and awareness-raising among IKEA staff. These measures can help prevent future instances of child labor and ensure compliance with ethical standards.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of immediate action to address the existing cases of child labor in the supply chain. While implementing long-term preventive measures is crucial, IKEA should also consider immediate steps to ensure the well-being of the children already involved in labor exploitation.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the issue of child labor in IKEA's supply chain, but it could benefit from incorporating more immediate actions to address the current cases of exploitation while working towards long-term prevention.
