The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes fairness and equal opportunity in the funding process for student organizations. By declining Alex's request for personalized guidance, Drake avoids the potential perception of favoritism and maintains the integrity of the funding process. The response also offers a practical alternative by suggesting the use of available resources and offering general support to Alex, ensuring he still receives guidance within the established framework.

However, a potential improvement could be to address Alex's feelings directly by acknowledging his effort and enthusiasm in crafting the proposal. By empathizing with Alex's position and expressing appreciation for his dedication, Drake could help soften the impact of declining the request for a personal review. This approach could help maintain a positive relationship with Alex while upholding professional ethics and fairness in the funding process.
