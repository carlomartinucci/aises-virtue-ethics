The answer provided is specific and actionable, offering practical steps to address the issue of disengagement within the board of the nonprofit organization. By scheduling individual meetings with each board member, emphasizing the importance of active participation, seeking feedback, proposing a board development committee, and organizing training sessions, the executive director is taking proactive measures to improve board engagement and effectiveness.

However, while the suggested actions are commendable, there are a few shortcomings in the response. Firstly, the answer does not address the potential resistance or pushback from board members who have been serving for more than 15 years and may be resistant to change. It would be valuable to include strategies for managing any resistance and building consensus among the board members. Additionally, the response could benefit from outlining specific measurable goals and timelines for improving board engagement, to ensure accountability and track progress effectively.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the situation and offers practical steps to address the issue of board disengagement. By incorporating strategies to manage resistance, setting clear goals, and establishing accountability measures, the executive director can enhance the effectiveness of the board and drive the organization towards achieving its goals.
