The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on expressing genuine concern for John's well-being and offering practical support. The approach of scheduling a separate meeting to address the sensitive issues, encouraging John to seek professional help, and offering to assist in finding resources is commendable. The emphasis on supporting John through his challenges and providing ongoing spiritual and emotional guidance also reflects a caring and compassionate approach.

However, there are areas for improvement. The response could be more specific in outlining concrete steps to help John, such as providing specific resources for therapy or addiction support groups. Additionally, the answer could address the potential risks associated with John's current behavior, such as the impact on his family and the importance of addressing his mental health concerns promptly. Emphasizing the importance of seeking help from qualified professionals in addressing depression and addiction more explicitly would strengthen the response.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a good balance between empathy and practical support, but it could benefit from more specific guidance and a clearer emphasis on the urgency of addressing John's mental health concerns.
