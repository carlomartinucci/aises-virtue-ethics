The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes transparency and honesty, which are key principles in journalism ethics. By advising Nadia to disclose her involvement in the student organization to her editor, it promotes accountability and helps maintain her credibility as a journalist. It also acknowledges the potential bias that could arise from her personal connections and suggests a proactive approach to address it.

One positive aspect of the answer is the practical suggestion to have an open conversation with her editor about her concerns regarding impartiality. This can lead to a collaborative effort in ensuring balanced reporting by considering alternative approaches if necessary.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of specific strategies or guidelines on how to mitigate bias in her reporting. While discussing with her editor is a good start, it would have been beneficial to provide concrete steps or techniques that Nadia can implement to uphold journalistic standards of fairness and accuracy.

Overall, the answer is sound in its recommendation for transparency and communication, but could be enhanced by including more actionable steps for Nadia to follow in order to navigate the ethical dilemma effectively.
