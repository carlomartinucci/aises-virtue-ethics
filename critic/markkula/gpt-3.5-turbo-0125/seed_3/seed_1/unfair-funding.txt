The suggested actions for Claire to take are practical and actionable in addressing the ethical concerns within the scenario. By implementing a system where Garret is recused from decisions involving his club's funding requests, Claire can help mitigate any perceived bias and ensure fairness in the allocation process. This action directly addresses the conflict of interest without derailing Garret's excellent work.

Furthermore, proposing more transparent and objective criteria for evaluating funding requests can help address the issue of unequal distribution of funds among clubs. Setting clear guidelines will create a structured approach to decision-making, promoting fairness and accountability in the process.

Introducing a spending cap on individual clubs is a proactive step towards preventing any single club from dominating the funding allocation. This measure can promote equity and prevent resource disparities among student groups.

Overall, the suggested actions are specific, practical, and actionable in improving the fairness and transparency of the funding allocation process in the student government. Claire's considerations demonstrate a thoughtful approach to addressing ethical concerns while maintaining the integrity of the system.
