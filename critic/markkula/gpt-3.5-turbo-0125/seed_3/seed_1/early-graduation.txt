The answer provided is ethical as it encourages Grace to communicate openly and honestly about her situation with the senior members of the student government. By seeking their input and advice, Grace can make a more informed decision that takes into account the potential impact on the organization. The suggestion to explore alternative ways to stay involved and contribute, even after graduating early, shows consideration for fulfilling commitments and finding a solution that benefits both Grace and the student government.

Positive aspects:
1. Encourages open and honest communication.
2. Considers the impact on the organization.
3. Suggests exploring alternative ways to contribute.

Areas for improvement:
1. Could provide more specific guidance on how Grace can address the potential impact on committee work and voting ratios in the spring.
2. Could suggest discussing potential solutions with the broader student government, not just senior members.

Overall, the answer offers sound advice for Grace to navigate her situation ethically, but could benefit from more specific suggestions on addressing the organizational impact and involving a wider group in the decision-making process.
