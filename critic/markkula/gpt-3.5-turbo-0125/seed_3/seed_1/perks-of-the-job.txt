The answer provided is specific and actionable, offering a practical solution to the scenario presented. By scheduling a private meeting with Julia to discuss the issue, the response addresses the need for open communication and confrontation of the problem. It acknowledges Julia's contributions to the organization while also highlighting the importance of adhering to established policies regarding the use of office resources. The suggestion of finding alternative solutions and offering support in reaching a fair resolution demonstrates a balanced approach that considers both Julia's perspective and the organization's interests.

However, a potential weakness in the response is the lack of a clear plan in case Julia refuses to change her behavior or rejects the suggestion for finding alternative solutions. It would have been beneficial to include a contingency plan for escalating the issue if the initial discussion does not lead to a resolution.

Overall, the answer presents a sensible course of action that prioritizes communication and problem-solving while recognizing the complexities of the situation. To enhance the response, it could be improved by incorporating a contingency plan for addressing potential resistance from Julia.
