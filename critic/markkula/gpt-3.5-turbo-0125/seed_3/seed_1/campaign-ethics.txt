The answer provided is a practical and actionable response to Olivia's situation. Seeking guidance from a mentor or advisor, discussing concerns openly with trusted individuals, and considering transparency with other potential candidates are all positive steps towards addressing the ethical dilemma at hand. Additionally, reviewing university guidelines and ensuring compliance with policies demonstrates a commitment to ethical behavior.

However, the answer could be improved by including specific actions Olivia can take to mitigate the potential unfair advantage she may have inadvertently gained. For instance, Olivia could consider accelerating the timeline for implementing the initiatives to ensure they benefit the student body promptly rather than strategically delaying them for personal gain. By taking concrete steps to level the playing field and prioritize the community's interests over her campaign, Olivia can demonstrate a genuine commitment to ethical leadership.
