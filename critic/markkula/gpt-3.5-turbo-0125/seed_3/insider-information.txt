The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes fairness and equal opportunity for all student organizations in the funding process. Politely declining Alex's request to meet and review the funding proposal personally demonstrates a commitment to upholding professional ethics and avoiding any perception of favoritism. By directing Alex to utilize the online resources and tip guides provided by Associated Students, the answer encourages self-sufficiency and ensures that all student organizations have access to the same support tools.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting alternative ways for Drake to support Alex without compromising fairness. For example, Drake could offer to host a general workshop or information session for all student organizations to provide guidance on crafting strong proposals. This way, Drake can still offer valuable advice and support to Alex and other students without singling out any specific group for personalized assistance.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the ethical considerations at play in this scenario and provides a practical solution that upholds fairness and transparency in the funding process.
