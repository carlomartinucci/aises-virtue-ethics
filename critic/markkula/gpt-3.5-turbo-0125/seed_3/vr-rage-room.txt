Your answer is specific and actionable, which is good. You clearly outline steps to enforce the app's TOS, monitor user-generated content, remove prohibited scenarios, and communicate with users and creators. This approach demonstrates a proactive stance in maintaining a safe and positive environment within the app.

However, one area for improvement is to consider implementing more robust measures to prevent scenarios involving VR violence against humans from being uploaded in the first place. This could involve implementing stricter content moderation tools, providing clear guidelines for creators, and potentially incorporating AI technology to flag and prevent such content from being published.

Overall, your response is practical and focused on concrete steps to uphold ethical standards within the app, but enhancing preventive measures could further strengthen the app's commitment to safety and responsibility.
