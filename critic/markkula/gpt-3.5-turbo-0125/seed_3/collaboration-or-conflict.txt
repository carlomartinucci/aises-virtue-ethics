The answer provided is a practical and actionable approach to the situation. It suggests open communication, active listening, and collaboration to address the issues at hand. By proposing a clear plan of action with specific deadlines and responsibilities, it aims to move the event planning process forward effectively. The emphasis on understanding Alanna's perspective and offering support shows a willingness to work towards a mutually beneficial solution.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the potential consequences of the current situation more explicitly. It would be beneficial to acknowledge the risks of further delays and the impact it could have on the event's quality and popularity. Additionally, considering alternative solutions or contingency plans in case the collaboration with RHA does not improve would enhance the answer's practicality.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for resolving the conflict between student government and RHA, but could benefit from a more thorough evaluation of potential outcomes and alternative courses of action.
