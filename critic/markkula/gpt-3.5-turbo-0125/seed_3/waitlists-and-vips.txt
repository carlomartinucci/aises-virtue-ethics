The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes fairness and inclusivity by offering the extra tickets to the entire senior class on a first-come, first-served basis. By acknowledging the mistake and setting clear guidelines for distributing the tickets, the answer ensures transparency and equal opportunity for all students to attend the event. This approach also helps avoid conflicts of interest that may arise from favoring Callie's friends over other seniors.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the potential logistical challenges of managing the responses within a short time frame. Providing specific strategies on how to efficiently handle the ticket distribution process, such as using an online form or setting up a designated email account for responses, would make the answer more actionable. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of communicating the process clearly to all seniors and ensuring that the selection is done fairly and transparently would further strengthen the response.
