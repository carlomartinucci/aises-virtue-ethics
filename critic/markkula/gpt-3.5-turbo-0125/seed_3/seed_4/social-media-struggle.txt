The answer provided is a good starting point for Matt to address the situation with John. It emphasizes the importance of professionalism and integrity within the student government organization, which is commendable. By suggesting a private conversation with John to express concerns and offer support, Matt shows a willingness to address the issue constructively.

However, the answer could be improved by including a more concrete plan of action in case John refuses to take down the video or make his profile more private. Matt should consider discussing potential consequences with John if the video remains public, such as the impact on his reputation and standing within the organization. Additionally, it would be beneficial for Matt to seek guidance from an advisor or mentor within the student government to navigate this delicate situation effectively.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for Matt to address the issue with John, but it could benefit from more specific steps to take if John does not respond positively to the initial conversation.
