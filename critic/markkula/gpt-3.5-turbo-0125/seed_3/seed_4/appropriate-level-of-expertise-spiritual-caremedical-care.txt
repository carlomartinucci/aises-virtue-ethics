The answer provided is ethical as it acknowledges the seriousness of the situation and the potential risks John is facing. It demonstrates a caring and supportive attitude towards John's well-being and emphasizes the importance of seeking professional help.

The good aspects of this response include the proactive approach of scheduling a separate meeting with John to address his issues directly, the emphasis on offering support and resources for professional help, and the continued emotional and spiritual support being offered by the pastor. Encouraging John to seek help and reassuring him that it is a courageous step are positive steps towards helping him overcome his challenges.

However, the response could be improved by being more specific about the resources and support available within the church community or through external organizations that specialize in mental health and addiction issues. Providing concrete steps and options for John to consider would make the advice more actionable and practical. Additionally, the response could benefit from outlining a plan for regular follow-ups and monitoring of John's progress to ensure he is receiving the help he needs.

Overall, the response is ethical and caring, but could be enhanced by offering more specific and actionable steps to support John through his struggles.
