Your response is specific and actionable, providing a clear course of action for addressing the issue at hand. You demonstrate a good understanding of the situation by acknowledging Julia's contributions while also highlighting the impact of her actions on the organization's budget. Your approach of scheduling a private meeting to discuss the concerns and suggesting alternative solutions shows a balanced and fair approach to resolving the issue.

However, it could be beneficial to address the potential consequences of Julia's actions on the organization more explicitly. Highlighting the negative impact on student programs due to the misuse of resources could further emphasize the importance of addressing the issue. Additionally, offering to help Julia find alternative solutions could be seen as enabling her behavior rather than holding her accountable.

Overall, your response is practical and provides a clear plan of action, but it could benefit from a more robust discussion of the consequences and potential implications of Julia's actions.
