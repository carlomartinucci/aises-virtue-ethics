The answer provided is fairly ethical and practical. It emphasizes the importance of transparency and open communication, which is a positive approach to handling conflicts of interest. Additionally, the suggestion of temporarily stepping back from the outdoor club during the petitioning process shows a proactive effort to mitigate any potential bias or favoritism. Seeking guidance from mentors or advisors within the organization is also a good strategy to navigate the situation effectively.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting specific ways in which Miguel can ensure that the petitioning process remains fair and transparent while he temporarily steps back from the club. Providing concrete examples of how he can involve other executive members in the decision-making process and establish clear guidelines for evaluating clubs would make the response more actionable. Additionally, outlining a plan for how Miguel can reintegrate into the club after the petitioning process is complete would enhance the overall effectiveness of the proposed solution.
