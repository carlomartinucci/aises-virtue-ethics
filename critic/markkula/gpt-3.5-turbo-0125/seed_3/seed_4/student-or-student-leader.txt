The answer provided is ethical as it considers the unique circumstances of the two senators while also maintaining the integrity of the organization. By discussing the situation with the senators individually and gathering input from the rest of the Senate, the response shows a thoughtful and inclusive approach to problem-solving.

The suggestion of allowing remote participation or submitting reports in advance demonstrates a willingness to find practical solutions to accommodate the senators' scheduling conflicts. Considering adjusting the attendance policy on a case-by-case basis shows flexibility and a recognition of the senators' dedication to their academic pursuits.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific details on how exactly remote participation or adjusted attendance policies would be implemented. It would be beneficial to outline a clear process for evaluating and approving such accommodations to ensure fairness and transparency within the organization. Additionally, addressing potential challenges or implications of these solutions would further strengthen the response.
