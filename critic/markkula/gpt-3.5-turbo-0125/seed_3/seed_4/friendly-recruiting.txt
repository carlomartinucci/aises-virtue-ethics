The answer provided outlines a structured approach to addressing Saumya's dilemma. By first reviewing the applications of the remaining candidates and considering offering support or training to help them improve their fit for the committees, the response demonstrates a commitment to fairness and giving all applicants a chance.

Involving the committee chairs in the decision-making process is a positive step, as it shows a willingness to seek input from relevant stakeholders and ensure transparency. Additionally, proposing to approach friends as potential candidates is acceptable as long as it is done with full disclosure to the committee chairs and with their approval.

However, a potential downside is the reliance on Saumya's friends as fallback options. While they may be well-suited for the roles, the perception of favoritism or bias could arise if they are brought in without a clear and fair selection process. It would be advisable to explore all available avenues with the existing applicants before turning to personal connections.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and ethical framework for navigating the situation, emphasizing a thorough evaluation of all candidates and open communication with relevant parties. Strengthening the focus on fairness and meritocracy in candidate selection would further enhance the ethical approach in this scenario.
