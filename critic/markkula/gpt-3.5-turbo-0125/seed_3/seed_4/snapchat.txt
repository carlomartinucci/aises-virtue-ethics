The answer provided is quite ethical, as it addresses the need to assess the impact of the situation on the company's reputation and user trust, and emphasizes the importance of issuing a public statement acknowledging the seriousness of the issue. The recommendation to express genuine remorse, outline concrete steps to prevent such behavior in the future, and implement sensitivity training for employees is commendable. Additionally, monitoring public sentiment and engaging with stakeholders shows a proactive approach to addressing concerns.

However, the evaluation could be improved by suggesting more specific actions that Snapchat can take to demonstrate their commitment to addressing the issue. For example, providing details on the concrete steps that will be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future, such as establishing a task force to review company policies on harassment and discrimination, could enhance the effectiveness of the response. Additionally, offering specific examples of how Snapchat can engage with stakeholders, such as hosting town hall meetings or conducting surveys to gather feedback, would further strengthen the proposed approach.
