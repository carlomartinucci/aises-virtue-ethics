The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on addressing the patient's concerns with empathy and understanding while aiming to provide appropriate care. It emphasizes the importance of psychoeducation, clarifying inconsistencies in the patient's statements, and collaborating with the patient to manage his distress effectively. These actions are beneficial as they prioritize the patient's well-being and aim to build trust in the treatment process.

However, a potential improvement could be to consider involving a multidisciplinary team, such as collaborating with a sexual health specialist or involving a therapist experienced in working with individuals with schizophrenia. This could provide a more comprehensive approach to address the patient's concerns and ensure holistic care.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable approach to handling the situation ethically, but there is room for enhancement by expanding the scope of collaborative care to better support the patient's needs.
