The suggested actions are practical and specific to address the ethical concerns in the scenario involving Claire, Garret, and the student government funding committee. By implementing a system where Garret is recused from decisions involving his club's funding requests, Claire can mitigate the perceived bias and maintain fairness in the allocation process. Additionally, proposing transparent and objective criteria for evaluating funding requests can help ensure a more equitable distribution of funds among all clubs. Introducing a spending cap on individual clubs could also prevent one club from dominating the funding allocation.

Overall, the response provides actionable steps for Claire to address the ethical dilemma effectively. However, it could be improved by considering potential consequences of these actions, such as how Garret and other committee members may react to the changes and how to communicate these changes effectively to maintain trust and transparency within the student government. Additionally, exploring ways to involve other stakeholders in the decision-making process could further enhance the fairness and legitimacy of the funding allocation system.
