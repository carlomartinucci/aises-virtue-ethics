The answer provided is ethical as it promotes fairness and transparency in the funding process, ensuring equal opportunities for all student organizations. By declining Alex's request for personalized guidance, Drake avoids creating a perception of favoritism and upholds his professional ethics. The explanation given to Alex about the importance of following the standard resources and guidelines provided shows a commitment to maintaining integrity in the process.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting additional ways for Drake to support Alex without compromising fairness. For instance, Drake could offer to host a general workshop or information session for all student organizations to provide guidance on crafting strong funding proposals. This way, Drake can still offer valuable advice while ensuring that all groups have access to the same level of support.

Overall, the response demonstrates a clear understanding of ethical considerations in this scenario and provides a practical solution to maintain fairness and integrity in the funding process.
