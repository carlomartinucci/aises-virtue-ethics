The answer provided is practical and actionable in addressing Bryson's situation. By scheduling individual meetings with each staff member to discuss workload and stress levels, Bryson demonstrates a proactive approach to understanding the challenges his team is facing. Open communication and seeking input from the staff on how to better support them are positive steps towards creating a more balanced work environment.

Reassessing the distribution of responsibilities based on feedback and potentially adjusting tasks or seeking additional resources shows a willingness to adapt and prioritize effectively. Reflecting on personal workload and considering reclaiming crucial responsibilities that have been delegated is a good way to ensure that all essential tasks are being addressed.

One area for improvement could be to also consider long-term solutions to prevent future overloading of staff, such as implementing better workload management strategies or discussing potential restructuring of responsibilities within the team. Additionally, setting clear expectations and boundaries for delegation in the future could help prevent similar situations from arising.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for addressing the immediate concerns within Bryson's team and taking steps towards a more balanced and effective distribution of responsibilities.
