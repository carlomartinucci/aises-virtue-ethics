The answer provided is specific, practical, and actionable in addressing the issue of child labor in IKEA's supply chain. It outlines clear steps such as conducting supplier reviews, implementing new audit processes, developing a code of conduct, providing training, collaborating with NGOs, and establishing reporting mechanisms. These actions demonstrate a proactive approach to addressing the ethical concerns raised by the accusations of child labor in the rug industry.
