The answer provided is specific and actionable, offering a practical approach to addressing the ethical issue at hand. By suggesting a private meeting with Julia to discuss the concerns, the answer shows a willingness to address the problem directly and respectfully. Acknowledging Julia's contributions while emphasizing the importance of following rules and policies demonstrates a balanced approach that considers both sides of the situation.

However, the answer could be improved by including potential consequences of Julia's actions on the organization's budget more explicitly. By highlighting the impact of her actions on student programs and the organization's financial health, it would provide a clearer understanding of the seriousness of the issue. Additionally, offering specific suggestions for alternative solutions, such as using personal resources or seeking permission for occasional use of office supplies, would enhance the practicality of the response.

Overall, the answer is a good starting point for addressing the ethical dilemma, but it could benefit from more explicit discussion of consequences and specific alternative solutions to make it even more effective in resolving the situation.
