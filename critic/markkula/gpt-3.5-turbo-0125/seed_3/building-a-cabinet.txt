The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on conducting individual interviews with the opposing candidates to assess their motivations, vision, and willingness to work collaboratively despite the election outcome. This approach allows for a fair evaluation of each candidate based on their qualifications and potential impact on organizational unity.

The good aspects of this approach include the emphasis on gathering relevant information through interviews to make an informed decision. By considering the candidates' motivations and attitudes, Marcus can select someone who is genuinely committed to contributing positively to the organization, regardless of the election outcome. This approach also aligns with the goal of fostering unity within the student government by giving all qualified candidates a fair chance to be part of the executive cabinet.

However, a potential drawback of this approach could be the subjectivity involved in evaluating motivations and attitudes during the interviews. It may be challenging to accurately gauge a candidate's sincerity or willingness to set aside resentments based on a single conversation. Additionally, there is a risk of bias influencing the selection process, especially if personal relationships or past interactions with the candidates come into play.

To address these potential drawbacks, Marcus should ensure that the interview process is structured and standardized to gather consistent information from each candidate. It would be beneficial to include specific questions related to past experiences, conflict resolution, and teamwork to assess how well the candidates align with the organization's values and goals. Additionally, seeking input from other trusted members of the student government or advisors could provide a more objective perspective on the candidates' suitability for the executive cabinet.

Overall, the proposed action is a practical and actionable approach that prioritizes fairness and unity within the organization. By refining the interview process and seeking additional perspectives, Marcus can enhance the objectivity and effectiveness of his decision-making process.
