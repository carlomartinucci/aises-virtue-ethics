The answer provided is practical and actionable in addressing the issue of board engagement within the nonprofit organization. By scheduling individual meetings with each board member, the executive director can gain insights into their level of commitment and address concerns directly. Emphasizing the importance of active participation and setting common goals is a positive step towards aligning the board with the organization's mission.

Furthermore, proposing the establishment of a board development committee and organizing training sessions demonstrates a proactive approach to enhancing board involvement and effectiveness. These initiatives can help educate board members on their roles and responsibilities, ultimately leading to improved engagement and better decision-making within the organization.

However, the answer could be improved by also considering the potential reasons behind the lack of engagement from long-serving board members. It may be beneficial for the executive director to delve deeper into understanding any underlying issues or obstacles that are hindering board participation. Additionally, involving board members in the creation of solutions and action plans could foster a sense of ownership and commitment to the proposed changes.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the issue of board engagement within the nonprofit organization, but could benefit from a more comprehensive approach that considers the perspectives and concerns of all board members.
