The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the protection of Joshua's privacy and the need for a fair and confidential discussion on the disciplinary issue. By asking the senator to leave, Akira is aiming to uphold the integrity of the process and prevent potential harm to Joshua's reputation. The response also acknowledges the importance of transparency and assures the senator that the decision-making process will be fair and in line with established procedures.

However, a potential downside of this approach is that it may be perceived as contradictory to Akira's platform of promoting transparency in student government. By asking the senator to leave without clear bylaws to support her decision, it could raise questions about consistency and fairness in enforcing rules within the organization. Additionally, it may lead to further conflict or dissent among members if not handled carefully.

To improve the response, Akira could consider addressing the lack of specific bylaws regarding confidentiality in disciplinary matters and work towards establishing clear guidelines for handling such situations in the future. This proactive approach would help prevent similar conflicts from arising and ensure that decisions are made transparently and fairly within the student government.
