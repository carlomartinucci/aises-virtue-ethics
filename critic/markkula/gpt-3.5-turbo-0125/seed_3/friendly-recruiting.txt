The answer provided is practical and offers a structured approach to addressing the dilemma faced by Saumya. By first reviewing the applications of the remaining candidates and considering offering them support or training, the answer demonstrates a willingness to give all applicants a fair chance. Additionally, reaching out to the committee chairs for input shows a collaborative approach to problem-solving and ensures transparency in the decision-making process.

However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the importance of maintaining fairness and impartiality in the selection process. While it is understandable that Saumya may feel her friends are the best fit for the positions, it is crucial to prioritize the qualifications and merits of all applicants equally. The answer could have included a stronger emphasis on the need to avoid favoritism and ensure that all decisions are made in the best interest of the university and its student body.

Overall, the answer provides a practical framework for addressing the situation, but could benefit from a stronger emphasis on fairness and impartiality in decision-making.
