The answer provided is ethical as it encourages Grace to be transparent about her situation and seek guidance from senior members of the student government. By having an open conversation, Grace can address the potential impact of her early graduation on the organization and explore alternative ways to contribute. This approach prioritizes honesty, communication, and collaboration, which are essential in ethical decision-making.

Positively, the answer emphasizes the importance of considering the needs of the organization and fulfilling commitments. It also suggests practical steps for Grace to take, such as exploring advisory roles or transition planning, to continue her involvement even after graduating early.

However, a potential drawback is that the answer does not explicitly address the ethical implications of running for a position that she knows she cannot fully commit to. While the focus is on seeking advice and finding alternative ways to contribute, it could have delved deeper into the ethical considerations of potentially leaving a seat empty and impacting committee work and voting ratios.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable approach for Grace to navigate her situation ethically by being transparent, seeking guidance, and exploring alternative ways to contribute to the organization.
