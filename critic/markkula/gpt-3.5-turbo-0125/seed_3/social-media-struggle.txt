The answer provided is ethical as it encourages Matt to address the issue directly with John in a private and supportive manner. By expressing his concerns and emphasizing the importance of professionalism and integrity, Matt is taking a proactive approach to address the situation without resorting to public shaming or reporting John to higher authorities.

Positives:
1. Encourages open communication: By suggesting that Matt privately reach out to John, the answer promotes a constructive dialogue between the two individuals involved.
2. Focuses on support and guidance: The answer advises Matt to offer his support to help John navigate the situation and make better decisions in the future, which can foster personal growth and learning.
3. Considers potential repercussions: By acknowledging the potential negative consequences of coming forward, the answer shows an understanding of the complexities of the situation and offers a practical solution to address the issue without causing unnecessary harm.

Areas for improvement:
1. Lack of consideration for escalation: While addressing the issue privately is a good first step, the answer could also suggest that if John does not respond positively or continues to engage in inappropriate behavior, Matt may need to consider escalating the matter to higher authorities within the organization.
2. More emphasis on accountability: While offering support and guidance is important, the answer could also stress the importance of holding John accountable for his actions and the potential impact on the organization's reputation.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for addressing the ethical dilemma faced by Matt, but could benefit from additional guidance on escalation and accountability to ensure that the issue is effectively resolved.
