The answer provided is specific, practical, and actionable. By suggesting reaching out to the sexual assault prevention center, scheduling a meeting, highlighting the issue, proposing clearer guidelines, and offering collaboration, the response offers a clear course of action to address the problem. It acknowledges the specific issue of vague descriptions of consent and provides a solution that focuses on inclusivity and accessibility for neurodiverse individuals. This approach demonstrates a proactive and constructive way to address the issue at hand.
