The answer provided is specific and actionable in addressing the issue of lack of board engagement within the nonprofit organization. By scheduling individual meetings with each board member, the executive director is taking a proactive approach to understand the root of the problem and communicate the importance of active participation. Seeking feedback from board members and proposing the creation of a board development committee are practical steps towards improving board engagement and effectiveness.

However, the answer could be improved by considering the following points:
- The executive director should also address the issue of low staff morale directly by involving staff in the process of improving board engagement. Staff input and involvement can contribute to a more holistic approach towards organizational improvement.
- It might be beneficial for the executive director to set clear expectations and goals for board members, outlining specific metrics for engagement and participation to hold them accountable.
- In addition to training sessions, the executive director could explore other ways to incentivize and motivate board members to actively contribute to the organization's mission, such as recognition programs or opportunities for personal development.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the issue of board engagement within the nonprofit organization, but could benefit from a more comprehensive approach that includes staff involvement, clear expectations, and additional motivational strategies.
