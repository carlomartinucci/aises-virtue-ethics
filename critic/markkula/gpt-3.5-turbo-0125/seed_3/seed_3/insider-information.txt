The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes fairness and equal opportunity for all student organizations in the funding process. Politely declining Alex's request to meet and review the proposal personally demonstrates a commitment to maintaining professional ethics and avoiding any perception of favoritism. The suggestion to guide Alex towards utilizing the online resources and tip guides provided by Associated Students shows a proactive approach to helping him improve his proposal while ensuring that he has access to the necessary support. Offering to answer general questions about the funding process also displays a willingness to assist without compromising fairness.

To improve the response further, it could have included a suggestion for Drake to advocate for additional workshops or group sessions where all student organizations can receive personalized guidance on their proposals. This would address the issue of not being able to meet individually with every group while still providing valuable support to all organizations. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of transparency and integrity in the funding process would further reinforce the ethical stance taken in the answer.
