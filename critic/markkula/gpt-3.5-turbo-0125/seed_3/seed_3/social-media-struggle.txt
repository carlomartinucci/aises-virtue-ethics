The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on addressing the issue directly with John in a private and supportive manner. By emphasizing the importance of professionalism and integrity within the student government organization, Matt is attempting to guide John towards making responsible decisions. Additionally, offering support to help John handle the situation demonstrates a willingness to assist rather than simply condemn.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting that Matt also consider seeking advice from a mentor or supervisor within the student government organization before approaching John. This additional step could provide Matt with guidance on how to navigate the situation effectively and ensure that his actions are in line with the organization's values and protocols. Additionally, the answer could benefit from emphasizing the importance of maintaining confidentiality and ensuring that the conversation with John is kept private to avoid unnecessary conflict within the organization.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable approach to addressing the issue while highlighting the need for professionalism and support in handling sensitive situations within a student government setting.
