The answer provided is specific and actionable, offering a detailed plan to address the issue of child labor in IKEA's supply chain. The actions suggested, such as conducting supplier reviews, implementing a new audit process, developing a code of conduct, providing training, collaborating with NGOs, and establishing reporting mechanisms, are practical steps that could help mitigate the problem of child labor.

One positive aspect of the answer is the focus on proactive measures, such as conducting regular on-site visits and collaborating with local organizations, to prevent and address child labor issues. By taking these steps, IKEA can work towards ensuring ethical practices within its supply chain and improving the working conditions of workers in vulnerable communities.

However, a potential drawback of the answer is the lack of discussion on the long-term sustainability of these actions. While the proposed steps are crucial in the immediate context, IKEA should also consider how to sustain these efforts over time and integrate ethical practices into its supply chain management strategy in the long run.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for addressing the issue of child labor in IKEA's supply chain, but IKEA should also focus on the continuous monitoring and improvement of its ethical practices to ensure long-term impact and compliance with labor laws.
