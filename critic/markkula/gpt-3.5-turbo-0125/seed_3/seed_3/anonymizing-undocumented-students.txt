The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes Adam's safety and well-being by respecting his request for anonymity. By addressing concerns about transparency and credibility in the article, Jessica can maintain trust with her readers while still highlighting the impact of immigration policy on students through Adam's testimonial. The suggestion to seek out other sources or experts to provide similar perspectives is also beneficial in strengthening the credibility of the article.

One area for improvement would be to advise Jessica to have a conversation with her editor, Anthony, about the importance of protecting Adam's identity and the reasoning behind using an anonymous source in the article. This would ensure that her decision is understood and supported by the editorial team, potentially avoiding conflicts later on.

Overall, the response provides practical and actionable steps for Jessica to navigate the ethical dilemma effectively while maintaining journalistic integrity and prioritizing the safety of her source.
