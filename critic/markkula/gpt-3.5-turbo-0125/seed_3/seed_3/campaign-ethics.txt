This answer provides a practical and actionable approach to addressing Olivia's ethical concerns in the scenario. Seeking guidance from a mentor or advisor demonstrates a willingness to receive external feedback and considerations. Additionally, proposing a meeting with other potential candidates shows a proactive effort to promote transparency and fairness among all participants in the election process. Reviewing university guidelines and policies further emphasizes the importance of ensuring compliance with ethical standards and regulations.

One positive aspect of this response is the emphasis on seeking outside perspectives and engaging in open communication with others involved in the election process. By doing so, Olivia can gather valuable feedback and ensure that her actions are aligned with ethical principles.

However, one potential improvement could be to suggest specific actions Olivia could take to mitigate any perceived advantage she may have gained by starting her campaign preparations early. This could involve disclosing her early start to the wider student body or taking steps to level the playing field for all candidates.

Overall, this response offers a solid foundation for addressing Olivia's ethical dilemma by focusing on seeking guidance, promoting transparency, and ensuring compliance with established rules.
