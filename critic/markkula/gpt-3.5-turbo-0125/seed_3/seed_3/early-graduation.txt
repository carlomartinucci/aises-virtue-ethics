The answer provided is ethical as it encourages Grace to be transparent about her situation and seek guidance from senior members of the student government. By having an open conversation, Grace can ensure that all parties are aware of the potential impact of her early graduation on the organization. The suggestion to explore alternative ways to stay involved, such as serving in an advisory capacity, demonstrates a commitment to finding solutions that benefit both Grace and the student government.

However, the advice could be improved by providing more specific suggestions on how Grace can mitigate the impact of her early graduation on the organization. For example, she could propose a plan to start transitioning her responsibilities to other members well in advance, or offer to continue supporting the student government remotely during the spring quarter. By proactively addressing these potential challenges, Grace can demonstrate her commitment to the organization and ensure a smoother transition for her successor.
