The answer provided is fairly ethical as it considers the concerns of both students and faculty members while aiming to find a balanced solution. By convening a meeting with key stakeholders and proposing a collaborative approach to include faculty information in the weekly newsletter, the answer demonstrates a proactive and inclusive mindset. Additionally, suggesting alternative communication channels shows a willingness to explore different avenues to meet the needs of all parties involved.

However, the answer could be improved by being more specific about the actions Maria would take to implement these proposed solutions. For instance, outlining a clear timeline for when these changes would be implemented and assigning responsibilities to ensure their execution would enhance the practicality of the response. Additionally, addressing potential challenges that may arise during the transition and providing strategies to overcome them would further strengthen the answer.

Overall, the answer is a good starting point for addressing the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario, but it could benefit from more detailed action steps to ensure the proposed solutions are effectively implemented and sustainable in the long run.
