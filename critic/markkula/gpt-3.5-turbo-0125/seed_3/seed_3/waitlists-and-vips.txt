The suggested course of action is ethical as it prioritizes fairness and inclusivity by offering the extra tickets to the entire senior class on a first-come, first-served basis. By acknowledging the mistake and providing a clear opportunity for those who missed out, it addresses the issue of turning away deserving seniors and potential conflicts of interest in distributing the tickets only to Callie's friends. Setting a specific time frame for responses also adds structure and transparency to the process.

However, one downside is the potential strain on Callie's time and resources in managing the responses within a short time frame. While it may be challenging to balance this with other event preparations, the ethical choice is to prioritize fairness and ensure all students have an equal chance to attend the Senior Ball.

To improve the response, it would be beneficial to suggest delegating some of the tasks related to event preparations to other team members or volunteers to free up time for managing the ticket allocation process effectively. This would help Callie address both the immediate need for fairness in ticket distribution and the ongoing event preparations without compromising on either aspect.
