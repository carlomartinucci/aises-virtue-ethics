The answer provided is practical and takes into consideration the unique circumstances of the two senators. By suggesting options such as remote participation and adjusting the attendance policy on a case-by-case basis, the response shows a willingness to find a solution that balances the needs of the organization with the individual situations of the senators. 

However, the answer could be improved by providing more concrete steps on how to implement these solutions. For example, detailing the process for remote participation, setting clear expectations for submitting reports in advance, and establishing specific criteria for adjusting the attendance policy would make the answer more actionable.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a thoughtful approach to addressing the dilemma and offers potential solutions that could effectively resolve the issue while maintaining the integrity of the student government organization.
