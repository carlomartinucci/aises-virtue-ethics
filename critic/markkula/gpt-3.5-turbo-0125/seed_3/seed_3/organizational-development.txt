Your answer provides specific and actionable steps for Carlos to consider before taking money from programs benefiting the student body to fund the retreat. By suggesting alternative funding options such as reaching out to sponsors or organizing a fundraising event, you show a proactive approach to the issue. Additionally, emphasizing transparent communication with the student body and seeking their input demonstrates an ethical consideration of the potential impact of the decision.

However, your response could benefit from more emphasis on the importance of prioritizing programs that directly benefit the student body over the retreat. While exploring alternative funding options is crucial, the ultimate goal should be to minimize the impact on programs that serve a broader student population. You could also delve deeper into the potential consequences of diverting funds from essential student government programs.

Overall, your answer provides a practical and thoughtful approach to the dilemma faced by Carlos, but it could be strengthened by a clearer prioritization of student body programs and a more thorough analysis of the potential trade-offs involved.
