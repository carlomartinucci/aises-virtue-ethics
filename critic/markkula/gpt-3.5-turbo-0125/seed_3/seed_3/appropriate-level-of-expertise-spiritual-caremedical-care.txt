The answer provided is mostly ethical as it prioritizes the well-being of John and encourages him to seek professional help for his mental health and addiction issues. The action of scheduling a separate meeting with John to have a heart-to-heart conversation shows care and concern for his situation. Offering to research and find resources for him is a proactive step to assist him in getting the help he needs.

However, the answer could be improved by being more specific in the resources and support options offered to John. Providing concrete information about local therapists, counselors, or support groups would be more actionable and beneficial for John. Additionally, the answer could have addressed potential barriers that John may face in seeking help, such as financial concerns or confidentiality issues, and provided strategies to overcome these barriers.

Overall, the answer is on the right track in terms of ethical decision-making, but it could be enhanced by providing more detailed and practical support for John in accessing professional help for his mental health and addiction issues.
