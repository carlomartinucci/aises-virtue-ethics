The answer provided is specific and actionable, offering practical steps for Claire to address the issue at hand. By suggesting that Garret be recused from decisions involving his club's funding requests, the answer addresses the potential bias in the allocation process. Additionally, proposing a more transparent and objective criteria for evaluating funding requests and introducing a cap on funding for individual clubs are practical solutions to ensure a fair distribution of funds.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more guidance on how Claire can effectively implement these suggestions. For example, it would be helpful to outline specific steps for creating and implementing the new evaluation criteria and setting a funding cap. Furthermore, addressing potential challenges or resistance from other committee members and ensuring buy-in for these changes would enhance the answer's practicality.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for Claire to address the ethical dilemma in a practical manner, but could benefit from more detailed guidance on implementation and overcoming potential obstacles.
