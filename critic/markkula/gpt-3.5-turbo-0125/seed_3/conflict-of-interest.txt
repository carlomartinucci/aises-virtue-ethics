The answer provided is ethical as it addresses the conflict of interest Miguel is facing and offers practical steps to mitigate it. By having open and transparent conversations with both the outdoor club and Associated Students, Miguel is taking the right approach to ensure fairness and neutrality in the decision-making process. Additionally, temporarily stepping back from the club during the petitioning process demonstrates a commitment to upholding the integrity of the organization and avoiding any appearance of bias.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on seeking guidance from mentors or advisors within the organization. This shows a willingness to learn from others and navigate the situation effectively. However, one area for improvement could be to also consider involving a third party or an independent mediator to oversee the petitioning process and provide an unbiased perspective.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and actionable plan for Miguel to address the conflict of interest and maintain his integrity in both roles. By following through with the proposed steps and seeking support from colleagues, Miguel can navigate this challenging situation responsibly.
