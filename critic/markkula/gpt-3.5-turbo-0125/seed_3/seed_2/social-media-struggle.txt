The answer provided is a good starting point for addressing the situation. It encourages Matt to directly communicate with John about his concerns, which is a proactive and respectful approach. By emphasizing the importance of professionalism and integrity within the student government, Matt is advocating for upholding the organization's standards. Additionally, offering support to help John handle the situation and make better decisions demonstrates a willingness to assist a fellow student leader.

However, the answer could be improved by including potential consequences of not addressing the issue, such as reputational damage to the organization or legal implications of underage drinking. It would also be beneficial to suggest that Matt document the conversation with John in case further action is necessary in the future. Overall, the answer is ethical in its approach to addressing the situation, but could be more comprehensive in considering all possible outcomes and steps for resolution.
