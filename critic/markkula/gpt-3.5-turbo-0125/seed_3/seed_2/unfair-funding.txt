The suggested actions are practical and specific, providing clear steps for Claire to address the issues at hand. Recommending that Garret be recused from decisions involving his club's funding requests is a good way to mitigate potential bias and ensure fairness in the allocation process. Proposing a transparent and structured criteria for evaluating funding requests is also a positive step towards promoting equal distribution of funds among all clubs.

However, the recommendation to introduce a spending cap on individual clubs may have potential drawbacks. While it could prevent one club from dominating funding, it may also stifle creativity and limit opportunities for clubs with larger-scale projects. Claire should carefully consider the implications of implementing a spending cap and ensure that it does not unintentionally hinder the activities of clubs with legitimate needs.

Overall, the proposed actions address the ethical concerns raised in the scenario effectively and provide Claire with actionable steps to improve the fairness and transparency of the funding allocation process. Claire should consider the potential impact of each recommendation before implementing them to ensure a balanced approach that benefits all student organizations.
