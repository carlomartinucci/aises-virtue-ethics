The proposed course of action is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being of the team members, acknowledges the potential issue of overloading them, and aims to address the core responsibilities of the role. 

Positives:
1. Scheduling individual meetings with each team member shows a proactive approach to understanding their workload and stress levels.
2. Openly communicating concerns and seeking input from the team members demonstrates a willingness to collaborate and support them effectively.
3. Reassessing the distribution of responsibilities based on feedback and potentially adjusting workload demonstrates a commitment to balancing tasks within the team.
4. Reflecting on personal responsibilities and considering reclaiming crucial tasks like advocating for student financial aid and government funding is essential for fulfilling the role effectively.

Areas for improvement:
1. The plan could benefit from specifying clear actions to address potential workload imbalances, such as setting specific timelines for redistributing tasks or implementing additional support measures.
2. Exploring specific strategies for enhancing team efficiency, like providing training or seeking external assistance, would enhance the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
3. Considering the impact of redistributing tasks on overall team dynamics and collaboration could help in maintaining a positive working environment while addressing workload concerns.

Overall, the proposed actions show a good balance between addressing team well-being and fulfilling essential job responsibilities, but further specificity in implementation strategies and considerations for team dynamics could enhance the ethical approach in Bryson's situation.
