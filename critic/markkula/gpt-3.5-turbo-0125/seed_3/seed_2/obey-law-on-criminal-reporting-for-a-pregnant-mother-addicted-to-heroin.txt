The answer provided is quite specific and actionable in addressing the ethical dilemma at hand. It appropriately considers the legal requirements while also prioritizing the well-being of the patient and her fetus. The response outlines a plan to have a detailed discussion with the patient about the legal implications, provide support in accessing medical and social services, and encourage voluntary entry into a treatment program. The emphasis on monitoring progress, providing additional resources, and ensuring proper prenatal care demonstrates a comprehensive approach to care.

One potential improvement could be to further explore the patient's concerns, fears, and motivations regarding seeking treatment. Understanding her perspective more deeply could help tailor the approach and support provided. Additionally, discussing potential alternatives or additional support systems outside of mandated reporting could be beneficial to explore all available options.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for a compassionate and effective course of action that considers both legal requirements and patient well-being. It could be enhanced by delving deeper into the patient's individual circumstances and offering a wider range of support options.
