The answer provided is a practical and actionable response to the scenario. By scheduling a meeting with Fred to discuss the concerns around audit hours and efficiency, Claire is taking a proactive approach to address the issues at hand. Proposing a plan to revisit the audit budget and scope demonstrates a willingness to find a solution that aligns with the actual work requirements for the audit of Company Z.

However, there are some aspects that could be improved upon.
