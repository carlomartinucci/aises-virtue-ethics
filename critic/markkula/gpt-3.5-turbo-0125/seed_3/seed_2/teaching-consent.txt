Your response is specific and actionable, which is great. You correctly identify the issue with the vague descriptions of consent in the materials and propose a concrete solution by suggesting clearer guidelines focusing on verbal communication and boundaries. Collaborating with the staff to revise the materials is a proactive step towards making them more inclusive for all students. However, one potential improvement could be to also suggest incorporating visual aids or alternative communication methods that could further enhance the accessibility of the resources for neurodiverse individuals. This would provide a more comprehensive approach to addressing the issue. Overall, your response is practical and addresses the ethical concern effectively.
