The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes fairness and inclusivity by offering the extra tickets to the entire senior class on a first-come, first-served basis. The suggestion to set a specific time frame for responses helps ensure transparency and equal opportunity for all students. By addressing the mistake openly and providing a fair chance for those who missed out on tickets, the answer promotes ethical conduct in handling the situation.

However, there are areas for improvement. The answer could have included a more detailed plan for managing the responses efficiently, such as setting up an automated system or delegating the task to another member of the student government to alleviate some of Callie's workload. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest more explicitly and considering the potential impact on Callie's relationships with her friends could have provided a more thorough evaluation.

Overall, the answer is practical and actionable in promoting fairness and inclusivity, but it could benefit from more specific strategies for managing the ticket distribution process effectively.
