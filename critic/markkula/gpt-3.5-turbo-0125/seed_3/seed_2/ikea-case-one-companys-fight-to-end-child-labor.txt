The answer provided is detailed, specific, and actionable, which is commendable. The actions suggested address the issue of child labor in IKEA's supply chain effectively. Conducting a thorough review of suppliers, implementing a new audit process, developing a code of conduct, providing training, collaborating with NGOs, and establishing a reporting mechanism are all practical steps to tackle the problem.

On the positive side, the response emphasizes the importance of on-site visits to verify compliance, the need for clear guidelines and consequences for suppliers, and the importance of raising awareness among IKEA staff. Collaboration with external organizations shows a proactive approach to addressing the root causes of child labor.

However, one area for improvement could be to further emphasize the consequences for suppliers found in violation of the code of conduct. Clear repercussions are essential to deter non-compliance effectively. Additionally, the plan could benefit from outlining a timeline for implementation and periodic evaluations to ensure sustained progress.

Overall, the answer provides a strong foundation for IKEA to address the issue of child labor in its supply chain, but enhancing the focus on enforcement and setting measurable goals would further strengthen the proposed actions.
