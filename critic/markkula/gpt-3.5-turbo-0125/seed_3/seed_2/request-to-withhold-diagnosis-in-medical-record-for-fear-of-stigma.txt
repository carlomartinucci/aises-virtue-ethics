The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it emphasizes the importance of addressing mental health concerns openly and honestly, educating Sophie about the potential consequences of not disclosing her history of depression, and encouraging her to seek comprehensive mental health care. It also offers practical solutions such as helping her find a therapist, discussing accommodations with the medical school, and prioritizing her well-being.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the issue of prescribing medication without acknowledging the true reason for the prescription. While the answer does mention the importance of therapy in addition to medication, it could be more explicit about the potential risks and ethical implications of prescribing medication under false pretenses. It would be beneficial to advise Sophie on the importance of honesty in her medical treatment and the potential consequences of misrepresentation in her medical record.

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for addressing the situation ethically, but it could be strengthened by addressing the issue of prescribing medication without acknowledging the true reason for the prescription more explicitly.
