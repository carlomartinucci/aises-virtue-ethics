The answer provided is ethical as it encourages open communication, collaboration, and seeking a solution that benefits all parties involved. It addresses the issue at hand by proposing a practical course of action that focuses on resolving the conflict and ensuring the success of the event.

Positives:
1. Scheduling a face-to-face meeting shows a commitment to direct communication, which can help clarify misunderstandings and build rapport.
2. Emphasizing the importance of the event and past successful collaborations highlights the value of the partnership between student government and RHA.
3. Proposing a clear plan of action with specific deadlines and responsibilities demonstrates a proactive approach to resolving the current challenges.
4. Offering assistance and support to Alanna and her team shows empathy and a willingness to work together to overcome obstacles.

Areas for Improvement:
1. The response could further address potential underlying reasons for Alanna's negative attitude towards student government to better understand and address her concerns.
2. It could suggest seeking mediation or involving a neutral third party if the direct meeting does not yield positive results.
3. Providing alternative solutions or contingency plans in case the collaboration with RHA cannot be salvaged could enhance the practicality of the response.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for addressing the situation, but could benefit from additional depth in understanding Alanna's perspective and exploring alternative approaches if direct communication proves ineffective.
