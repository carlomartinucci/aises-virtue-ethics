This answer provides a clear and practical course of action for the scenario presented. By emphasizing the importance of consulting with a psychiatrist for proper evaluation and treatment of a potential serious psychiatric disorder, it prioritizes Peter's well-being. The suggestion to help Peter find a psychiatrist and offer support with scheduling appointments demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing the situation.

Moreover, the answer acknowledges the limitations of the primary care physician's role in managing complex psychiatric conditions and highlights the complementary nature of seeking specialized care. It also reassures Peter that seeking help from a psychiatrist does not diminish the trust he has in his primary care physician, thereby maintaining the therapeutic relationship.

One improvement could be to address Peter's reluctance to see a psychiatrist more directly by exploring his concerns and fears about seeking specialized care. This could help in understanding and potentially overcoming his resistance, leading to a more effective resolution of the situation.

Overall, this response is ethical as it prioritizes Peter's well-being, recognizes professional boundaries, and offers practical steps to address the challenging scenario.
