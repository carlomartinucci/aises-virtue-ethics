The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being of John and offers practical steps to help him. By scheduling a separate meeting to address John's issues, expressing genuine concern, and encouraging him to seek professional help, the response shows a good understanding of the situation and the importance of proper care for John. Additionally, offering to research resources and providing ongoing support and guidance demonstrates a commitment to helping John through his challenges.

However, the response could be improved by being more specific in terms of the actions the pastor could take to ensure John gets the help he needs. For example, the pastor could offer to accompany John to his doctor's appointment or therapy sessions to provide moral support. Additionally, setting up a support system within the church community or involving other trusted individuals in John's life could further enhance the level of care and assistance he receives. Overall, the response is ethical and provides a good foundation for supporting John effectively through his struggles.
