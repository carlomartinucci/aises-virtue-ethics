The answer provided is a practical and actionable approach to addressing the issue of board engagement within the nonprofit organization. By scheduling individual meetings with each board member, the executive director can gain a better understanding of the barriers to engagement and work collaboratively to address them. Clearly communicating the organization's goals and the importance of active participation, as well as providing specific examples of impact, can help motivate board members to become more involved.

Setting clear expectations for attendance at meetings and events is also a good strategy to emphasize the critical role board members play in the organization's success. This approach focuses on communication, collaboration, and setting expectations, which are all important aspects of effective leadership in this situation.

However, one potential drawback of this approach is that it may not address deeper systemic issues within the board, such as entrenched attitudes or conflicts of interest. It would be beneficial for the executive director to also consider broader strategies for board development and governance reform to ensure long-term engagement and effectiveness.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for improving board engagement within the nonprofit organization, but it could be strengthened by incorporating additional strategies for addressing underlying issues within the board structure.
