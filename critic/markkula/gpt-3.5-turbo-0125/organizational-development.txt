The answer provided is practical and actionable. It suggests specific steps for Carlos to take in order to address the financial challenge he is facing. By exploring alternative funding options such as reaching out to sponsors or organizing a fundraising event, Carlos can potentially secure the necessary funds for the retreat without compromising the budget for student government programs that benefit the student body. This approach demonstrates a proactive and resourceful mindset in finding a solution that balances the needs of both the student government leaders and the student body.

However, one potential drawback of this solution is that securing additional funding may not always be feasible or guaranteed. It relies on external factors such as the willingness of sponsors or donors to contribute, which may not always align with the timeline or needs of the retreat. Therefore, while exploring alternative funding options is a good first step, Carlos should also consider contingency plans in case these efforts do not yield the desired results.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable solution to the ethical dilemma faced by Carlos, emphasizing the importance of seeking out creative solutions to address financial constraints without sacrificing the benefits of the retreat for student government members.
