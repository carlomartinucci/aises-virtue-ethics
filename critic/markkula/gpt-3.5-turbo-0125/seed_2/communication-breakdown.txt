The answer provided is practical and actionable in addressing Derek's situation. It suggests a specific course of action for Derek to take by scheduling a meeting with the Vice Provost to express the concerns regarding the off-campus fraternities and sororities. The advice to present the students' perspective, emphasize the importance of addressing their issues, and propose potential solutions demonstrates a proactive approach to bridging the gap between student needs and administrative constraints.

However, the answer could be improved by acknowledging the ethical dilemma Derek faces in compromising student initiatives to meet departmental objectives. It would be beneficial to advise Derek on how to navigate this ethical dilemma while still advocating for student interests effectively. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of maintaining transparency and authenticity in communication with both students and the administration would further enhance the ethical considerations in handling the situation.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and specific approach to addressing Derek's predicament, but could benefit from a more explicit discussion of the ethical implications involved and the importance of maintaining integrity in his role as President of the Associated Students.
