The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing Saumya's dilemma. By first reviewing the applications of the remaining candidates and considering their potential suitability for the committees, the answer demonstrates an attempt to give all applicants a fair chance. Additionally, reaching out to friends who are well-qualified and encouraging them to apply is a proactive step to ensure the best fit for the committees.

However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the importance of maintaining a clear and transparent selection process. It would be beneficial to explicitly state the need for open communication with all applicants about the decision-making process and criteria used for selection. This would help mitigate any potential perceptions of favoritism or bias towards Saumya's friends.

Overall, the answer provides a practical course of action that balances the need for qualified representatives on the committees with the importance of fairness and transparency in the selection process. Strengthening the emphasis on communication and transparency would further enhance the ethical evaluation of the response.
