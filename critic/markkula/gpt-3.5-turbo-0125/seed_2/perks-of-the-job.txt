The answer provided is specific and actionable, which is good. Scheduling a private meeting with Julia to address the issue directly shows a proactive approach to resolving the situation. Expressing concerns about the misuse of office resources and emphasizing the importance of following the rules set by the organization are steps in the right direction. Offering support and assistance in finding alternative solutions for completing homework without using organization resources is a positive way to address the problem constructively. Reminding Julia of the potential impact of her actions on the organization and the importance of setting a good example for others is also a good strategy.

However, the answer could be improved by including a plan for follow-up after the initial meeting. It would be beneficial to establish clear expectations and consequences if the behavior continues despite the discussion. Additionally, suggesting ways for Julia to make amends for the misuse of resources could further demonstrate a commitment to accountability and integrity. Overall, the response is a good starting point for addressing the ethical issue at hand, but could be strengthened by incorporating these additional elements.
