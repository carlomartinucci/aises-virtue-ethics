The answer provided is ethical as it addresses the potential conflict of interest that Miguel faces and offers a practical solution to maintain integrity and impartiality. By recusing himself from the evaluation process and seeking guidance from the ethics committee, Miguel demonstrates a commitment to upholding ethical standards and ensuring a fair assessment of the outdoor club's petition.

One positive aspect of this approach is that it prioritizes transparency and accountability by openly acknowledging the conflict of interest and taking proactive steps to address it. By involving the ethics committee or advisor, Miguel shows a willingness to seek guidance and adhere to established guidelines, which can help him navigate similar situations in the future.

However, a potential drawback of this approach is that Miguel may miss out on the opportunity to contribute his expertise and experience to the outdoor club's petitioning process. While stepping back is necessary to avoid bias, Miguel could explore alternative ways to support the club, such as providing guidance informally or assisting in non-decision-making capacities.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and actionable solution to the ethical dilemma faced by Miguel, emphasizing the importance of maintaining neutrality and integrity in his roles within the student government and the outdoor club.
