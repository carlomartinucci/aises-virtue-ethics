The answer provided is practical and actionable. By suggesting that Talia schedule a meeting with the sophomore students to discuss the smoking ban initiative and gather more insights, it shows an intention to involve the key stakeholders in the decision-making process. Additionally, seeking input from legal experts or advisors to understand the potential legal implications of the ban demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing the concerns raised by the university administration. Overall, the answer encourages a more informed decision-making process that considers multiple perspectives and seeks expert advice.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific details on how Talia can navigate the potential conflict between her personal beliefs and the wishes of her constituency. Offering strategies on how to communicate her decision effectively to the student body, regardless of the outcome, would enhance the response. Additionally, outlining potential compromises or alternative solutions that could address both the public health concerns and student rights would add depth to the evaluation.

Overall, the answer is practical and offers a solid foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario.
