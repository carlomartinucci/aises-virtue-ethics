The answer provided is practical and actionable, as it suggests a specific course of action for Drake to take in the given scenario. By recommending that Drake offer general advice that applies to all student organizations rather than providing personalized guidance to Alex, the answer addresses the ethical dilemma of maintaining fairness in the funding process.

One positive aspect of the answer is that it acknowledges the importance of supporting Alex while also considering the need to avoid giving him an unfair advantage over other student groups. By focusing on general advice that benefits all student clubs and societies, Drake can maintain professionalism and uphold fairness in the funding process.

However, a potential drawback of the answer is that it does not provide specific examples of the type of general advice Drake could offer to Alex. Including some concrete suggestions or tips that are broadly applicable to all funding proposals could enhance the practicality of the response.

Overall, the answer offers a reasonable solution to Drake's dilemma by balancing support for his friend with the need to uphold fairness in the funding process. Adding more specific suggestions for general advice would further improve the response's practicality.
