The answer provided is a good starting point for Matt to handle the situation. It acknowledges the importance of addressing the issue with John privately and attempting to guide him towards making better decisions. By offering support and emphasizing the need for professionalism, Matt shows a level of care and concern for both John and the reputation of the student government organization.

However, the answer could be improved by including a plan of action in case John does not respond positively to Matt's concerns. Matt should consider discussing the situation with other members of the student government or seeking advice from a faculty advisor on how to proceed if John refuses to take down the video or continues engaging in similar behavior. Having a contingency plan in place will help Matt navigate the situation more effectively and ensure that the integrity of the organization is upheld.

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for Matt to address the issue with John, but it could benefit from incorporating a strategy for handling potential resistance or lack of cooperation from John.
