The proposed solution is practical and addresses the core issue of ensuring that the concerns of the constituents are represented despite the senators' class conflicts. The approach of discussing the situation with the affected senators individually shows empathy and understanding towards their academic commitments. Proposing the use of proxies to represent the senators and vote on their behalf is a reasonable way to ensure continuity within the Senate and uphold the interests of their constituents.

However, the potential downside of this solution is that having proxies may not fully capture the senators' perspectives or intentions in discussions and voting processes. There is a risk that the proxies may not accurately represent the senators' views, leading to potential misrepresentation of their constituents' concerns. Additionally, the use of proxies may raise questions about the legitimacy of decision-making processes within the Senate.

To improve the solution, it would be beneficial to establish clear guidelines and protocols for how the proxies will operate, ensuring transparency and accountability in their roles. It would also be important to regularly check in with the affected senators and their proxies to ensure that the arrangement is working effectively and that the concerns of the constituents are being adequately addressed. Regular communication and feedback loops can help mitigate any potential issues that may arise from using proxies in Senate meetings.
