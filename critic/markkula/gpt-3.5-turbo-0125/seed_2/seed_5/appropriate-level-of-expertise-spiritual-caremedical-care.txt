The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being of John and encourages him to seek professional help for his mental health and addiction concerns. The response appropriately acknowledges the limitations of the pastor's expertise and suggests practical steps to support John effectively. By offering to assist in finding a counselor, recommending support groups, and continuing to provide emotional support, the pastor is taking proactive steps to address John's needs.

However, the answer could be improved by including more specific details on how to handle the situation if John continues to refuse professional help. It would be beneficial to outline potential strategies for gently persuading John to reconsider seeking professional assistance, such as highlighting the potential benefits for his family and future well-being. Additionally, providing resources for mental health hotlines or online support groups could offer John alternative avenues for seeking help if he is hesitant about in-person counseling. By supplementing the existing response with these actionable steps, the pastor can further support John in addressing his mental health and addiction challenges effectively.
