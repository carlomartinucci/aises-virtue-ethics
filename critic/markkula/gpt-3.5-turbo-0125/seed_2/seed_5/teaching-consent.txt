The answer provided is specific and actionable in addressing the issue at hand. By scheduling a meeting with the staff members responsible for creating the resources on consent, the individual is taking a proactive approach to communicate the problem with the vague descriptions and propose a solution. The suggestion to collaborate with experts in neurodiversity or disability advocacy to revise the materials demonstrates a willingness to involve relevant stakeholders for a more inclusive outcome. Furthermore, proposing training sessions or workshops tailored to educate both neurodiverse and neurotypical students on consent is a practical step towards addressing the accessibility of resources.

However, a potential improvement could be to emphasize the urgency of the situation, given the higher vulnerability of neurodiverse individuals to assault. It would be beneficial to set a timeline for the revisions and implementation of the new materials to ensure timely action. Additionally, considering involving neurodiverse students in the review process could provide valuable insights into their specific needs and preferences regarding consent education.

Overall, the response is commendable for its specificity and practicality in addressing the issue of vague consent materials for neurodiverse individuals, but it could be enhanced by adding a sense of urgency and involving neurodiverse students in the review process for a more comprehensive solution.
