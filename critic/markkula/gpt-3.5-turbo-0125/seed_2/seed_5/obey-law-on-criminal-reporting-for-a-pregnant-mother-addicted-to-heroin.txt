The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being of both the patient and the fetus while acknowledging the legal implications of reporting her drug use during pregnancy. By emphasizing the importance of seeking treatment and exploring available options, the response shows a commitment to supporting the patient in making positive changes.

One positive aspect of the answer is the focus on developing a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to the patient's needs, including prenatal care, addiction treatment, and parenting support. This approach recognizes the complexity of the situation and the importance of providing holistic care.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of specific guidance on how to navigate the legal requirements while still ensuring the patient receives the necessary support. Providing more detailed information on how to balance legal obligations with patient care could enhance the practicality of the response.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a compassionate and patient-centered approach to addressing the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. By continuing to offer non-judgmental support and guidance, the healthcare provider can help the patient make informed decisions about her care and the well-being of her baby.
