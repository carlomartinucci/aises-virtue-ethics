Your response provides a practical and actionable approach to the scenario presented. By first reviewing the applications of the remaining candidates and considering their suitability for the specific committees, you demonstrate a fair attempt to evaluate all options before bringing in your friends.

However, to improve your answer, you could further emphasize the importance of giving due consideration to all applicants, including the remaining candidates.

This would help ensure that your decision-making process is thorough and based on objective factors.

Moreover, while it is understandable that you believe your friends would be the best fit, it is crucial to avoid any bias towards them and to give fair consideration to all applicants, including those who actively sought out participation. Demonstrating a commitment to fairness and equal opportunity for all candidates is essential in upholding ethical standards in this scenario.
