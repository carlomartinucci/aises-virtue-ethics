The answer provided is a practical and actionable approach to addressing the issue of board engagement within the nonprofit organization. The suggestion to schedule individual meetings with each board member shows a commitment to understanding their perspectives and concerns, which is a positive step towards building stronger relationships.

Furthermore, emphasizing the organization's vision and goals, as well as seeking input from board members on how they can contribute to these objectives, demonstrates a collaborative approach to leadership. This can help in aligning the board members with the nonprofit's mission and fostering a sense of ownership and accountability.

The mention of exploring opportunities for board training and development is also beneficial as it can enhance the board members' understanding of their roles and responsibilities, ultimately leading to improved engagement and effectiveness.

However, it would be helpful to also consider setting clear expectations and goals for board members, establishing mechanisms for accountability, and implementing strategies to monitor and track progress towards increased engagement. Additionally, addressing any underlying issues that may be contributing to the lack of attendance and engagement, such as communication barriers or conflicting priorities, would be essential for creating a more cohesive and effective board.

Overall, the suggested approach is a good starting point for improving board engagement, but it would be beneficial to incorporate additional strategies for fostering a more proactive and committed board.
