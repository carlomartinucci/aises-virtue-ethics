Your answer is ethical as it prioritizes the protection of a vulnerable source and upholds journalistic integrity. By respecting the student's request for anonymity, you demonstrate a commitment to ensuring that individuals are not unfairly targeted or harmed due to their opinions. Advising Andres to focus on the broader issue of campus discourse instead of singling out the student helps maintain a balanced and informative article without unnecessarily exposing the student to further backlash.

One area for improvement could be to also consider the potential impact of the student's views on the campus community and how they contribute to the discussion on diversity and inclusion. By addressing the underlying controversy surrounding the bulletin board and providing context on differing perspectives, the article could encourage constructive dialogue and understanding among students with diverse viewpoints.

Overall, your response is practical and actionable, offering a clear course of action that aligns with ethical principles in journalism. It effectively balances the need to protect the student while addressing the broader issue at hand.
