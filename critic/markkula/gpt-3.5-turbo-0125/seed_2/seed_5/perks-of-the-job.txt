Your response is specific and practical in addressing the issue at hand. Scheduling a private meeting with Julia to discuss the misuse of office resources shows a proactive approach to addressing the problem directly. Expressing concerns about the impact on the organization's budget and emphasizing the importance of following rules and regulations are good points to make. Offering support in finding alternative solutions and reminding her of the potential consequences of her actions are also positive steps to take.

However, it would be beneficial to consider the potential consequences of Julia's actions not only on the organization's budget but also on the overall integrity and reputation of the student government. It might be helpful to discuss potential disciplinary actions or consequences if the behavior continues despite the conversation. Additionally, ensuring that there are clear guidelines moving forward to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future would be a proactive step to take.

Overall, your response addresses the situation effectively but could benefit from including a more comprehensive plan of action to prevent future issues and uphold the organization's values and integrity.
