Your answer is quite specific and actionable, which is commendable. By suggesting that Carrie should include the conversations about the statue in a light-hearted and respectful manner, you address the importance of authenticity and transparency while being mindful of potential repercussions. Furthermore, your suggestion to balance the coverage by highlighting positive aspects of student life is a practical way to maintain a fair representation.

However, one area for improvement is to provide more concrete strategies on how Carrie can navigate the potential impact on donor relationships. Offering specific steps or communication approaches to mitigate any negative consequences would enhance the practicality of your response. Additionally, considering ways to engage with the administration proactively to address concerns might also be beneficial.

Overall, your answer is mostly practical and specific, but providing more detailed strategies for managing donor relationships and addressing potential fallout with the administration would make it even more actionable.
