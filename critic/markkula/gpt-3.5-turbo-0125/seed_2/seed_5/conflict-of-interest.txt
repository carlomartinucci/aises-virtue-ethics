The answer provided is ethical as it promotes transparency and fairness in handling the potential conflict of interest. By choosing to recuse himself from the decision-making process regarding the outdoor club's petition, Miguel is prioritizing the integrity of the evaluation process. Seeking guidance from the organization's ethics committee or advisor further demonstrates a commitment to upholding ethical standards.

One positive aspect of the response is the clear action plan laid out, including informing relevant parties and seeking guidance. This shows a proactive approach to addressing the conflict of interest issue. By taking these steps, Miguel can maintain his reputation as an upright and impartial member of the student government.

However, one potential improvement could be to also consider stepping down from his role in the outdoor club temporarily to completely remove himself from any potential conflicts. While recusal is a good step, completely removing oneself from the club during the evaluation process could further enhance transparency and eliminate any perceived bias.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable solution to the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. Miguel's decision to recuse himself and seek guidance is a commendable approach to preserving the integrity of the evaluation process.
