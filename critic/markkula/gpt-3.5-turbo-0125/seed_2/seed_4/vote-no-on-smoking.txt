The answer provided is a practical and actionable approach to the situation. By scheduling a meeting with the sophomore students to discuss the smoking ban initiative and presenting the concerns raised by the university administration, Talia is effectively engaging with her constituency to gather more insights and perspectives. This approach demonstrates a willingness to consider all viewpoints and make an informed decision.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the potential consequences of going against the wishes of her constituency. Talia should carefully consider how her decision may impact her re-election chances and the trust of the students she represents. It would be beneficial for her to address this concern openly with the students during the meeting and explore potential compromises that may satisfy both the student body and the university administration.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for Talia to navigate the situation, but it could be strengthened by including a more thorough discussion of the potential consequences and strategies for managing them effectively.
