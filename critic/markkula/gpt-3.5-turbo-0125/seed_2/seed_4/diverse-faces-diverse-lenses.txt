The answer provided outlines specific and actionable steps to address the ethical concerns surrounding the Diversity in Faces (DiF) dataset created by IBM Research. Here is a fair evaluation:

Good:
1. The response acknowledges the need for an internal review to assess ethical implications, showing a commitment to self-reflection and improvement.
2. Engaging with the legal team at IBM demonstrates a recognition of the importance of legal compliance and potential liabilities.
3. Initiating discussions with the dataset creation team to address consent and privacy concerns displays a proactive approach to resolving issues.
4. Collaborating with external experts in data ethics and privacy shows a willingness to seek specialized knowledge and guidance.
5. Updating the IBM Research blog post and website with transparent information indicates a commitment to communication and accountability.

Bad:
1. While engaging with the legal team is important, the response could be enhanced by specifically outlining the legal obligations and liabilities identified in the review.
2. The response could benefit from providing more detail on the actions being taken to address privacy concerns and obtain consent from individuals whose photos are included in the dataset.
3. Collaborating with external experts is crucial, but specifying the areas in which their expertise will be utilized would strengthen the response.
4. Updating the IBM Research blog post and website is a positive step, but including a clear timeline for these updates would enhance transparency and accountability.

Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the steps needed to address the ethical issues raised by the creation and distribution of the DiF dataset. By providing more specific details and timelines for action, the response could be further improved in terms of transparency and accountability.
