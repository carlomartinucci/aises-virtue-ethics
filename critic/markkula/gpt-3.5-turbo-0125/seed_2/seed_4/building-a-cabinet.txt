Your answer provides a practical and specific suggestion for Marcus to appoint a candidate not directly tied to any of the election campaigns to the third spot in the executive cabinet. This recommendation aims to ensure balance, diversity, and fairness within the cabinet, which are important considerations in fostering a positive organizational environment. By suggesting a neutral appointment, you address the potential biases and conflicts that could arise from appointing only candidates from the election, demonstrating a commitment to inclusivity in decision-making processes.

However, your answer could be improved by acknowledging the importance of leveraging the strengths and experiences of the opposing candidates and campaign supporters. While neutrality and balance are crucial, it's also essential to consider the valuable contributions that individuals with different backgrounds and perspectives can bring to the executive cabinet. Encouraging Marcus to weigh these factors alongside the need for neutrality would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the situation.

Overall, your response is actionable and provides a clear direction for Marcus to make an ethical decision in appointing the third member of the executive cabinet. It effectively highlights the importance of fairness and inclusivity in organizational leadership.
