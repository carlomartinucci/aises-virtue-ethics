The response provided is practical and specific in addressing the scenario at hand. It acknowledges the constraints faced by the two senators and proposes a solution that allows them to fulfill their academic obligations while still maintaining their roles within the student government. By suggesting the use of proxies and ensuring that the absent senators can still provide input and guidance to their proxies, the answer attempts to balance the needs of both the organization and the individual senators.

One potential downside to this solution is that relying on proxies may not fully capture the perspectives and intentions of the absent senators, leading to potential misrepresentation of their constituents' concerns. Additionally, the use of proxies could raise questions about the legitimacy of decision-making processes within the student government.

To improve the response, it would be beneficial to also consider alternative solutions that could address the issue at hand while minimizing potential drawbacks. For example, exploring the possibility of adjusting the attendance policy to accommodate extenuating circumstances or finding ways to reschedule important discussions or votes to times when both senators can attend could be additional avenues to explore.

Overall, the provided response is a good starting point for addressing the scenario, but further consideration of possible consequences and exploration of alternative solutions could enhance the overall ethical handling of the situation.
