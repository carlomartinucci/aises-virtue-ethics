This answer is both ethical and practical. It demonstrates empathy and respect towards Alexandra's situation by assuring her of confidentiality and offering her the opportunity to review the article before publication. By focusing on the broader implications of the federal guidelines and using anonymized examples, the answer respects Alexandra's privacy while still addressing the issue effectively. The inclusion of a discussion on the challenges faced by survivors and the importance of supporting them helps to combat taboos surrounding sexual assault.

One area for improvement could be to explicitly address the concerns about potential speculation regarding the authenticity of survivors' claims if they remain anonymous. Acknowledging and addressing this concern directly in the article could further strengthen the ethical framework of the response.

Overall, this answer provides a balanced approach that respects Alexandra's privacy while raising awareness about the issue of sexual assault on college campuses. It offers actionable steps to navigate the ethical considerations involved in reporting on sensitive topics like this.
