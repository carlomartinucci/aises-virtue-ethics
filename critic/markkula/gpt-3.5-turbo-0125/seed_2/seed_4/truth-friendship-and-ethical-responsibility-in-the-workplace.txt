The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of honesty, integrity, and corporate responsibility. By advising Ben to disclose all the information he knows about Michael's fraudulent activities to the company, it promotes accountability and transparency within the organization. It also highlights the significance of prioritizing the company's well-being and reputation over personal relationships or loyalty to a friend.

On the positive side, the answer encourages Ben to act in the best interest of the company and its stakeholders, which is crucial for maintaining trust and ethical standards in the workplace. By cooperating with the internal investigation and providing essential information, Ben can contribute to resolving the issue and preventing similar unethical behavior in the future.
