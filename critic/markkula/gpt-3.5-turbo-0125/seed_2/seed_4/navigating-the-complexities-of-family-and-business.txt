The answer provided is fairly good in the sense that it emphasizes the importance of exploring all options, having open discussions, seeking compromise, and considering the potential impact on relationships. These are practical steps that could potentially help Mary navigate the situation with her family business. 

However, the answer could be improved by being more specific and actionable. For instance, it could suggest concrete strategies for finding new tenants or repurposing the building, provide tips on how to effectively communicate with Donald, offer guidance on how to involve a neutral third party in the discussions, and outline potential compromises that could be explored. 

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for Mary to start addressing the situation, but more specific and actionable advice would make it even more helpful in guiding her decision-making process.
