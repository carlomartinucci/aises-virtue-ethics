The answer provided is practical and actionable in addressing the issue at hand. By scheduling individual meetings with each board member, the executive director can effectively communicate the vision and goals of the nonprofit, seek their input, and address concerns about their roles. This approach also allows for exploring opportunities for board training and development to enhance their understanding of responsibilities and organizational needs.

However, one potential limitation is that individual meetings with each board member may be time-consuming, considering there are 20 members. To streamline the process, the executive director could consider conducting group meetings or workshops to address common concerns and provide training collectively. This approach could save time and foster a sense of teamwork among board members.

Overall, the answer presents a solid plan to engage the board and improve their commitment to the organization. To enhance effectiveness, the executive director should consider balancing individual meetings with more efficient group sessions to address the board's engagement collectively.
