The answer provided is ethical as it considers the sensitive nature of the situation and the potential impact of reporting on mental health. It acknowledges the importance of honoring the deceased student's memory while also raising awareness about mental health issues on campus. The suggestion to focus on celebrating the student's life and contributions, as well as providing information on mental health resources, demonstrates a thoughtful approach.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how to balance reporting on the student's death without sensationalizing it. Additionally, it would be beneficial to recommend concrete steps for Hana to take, such as consulting with mental health professionals for guidance on framing the story appropriately. Emphasizing the importance of responsible reporting and the potential risks of glamorizing suicide further would enhance the answer's practicality.

Overall, the answer is on the right track, but it could be strengthened by offering more actionable advice on how to cover the story in a sensitive and responsible manner.
