The answer provided is ethical as it addresses the potential conflict of interest that Miguel faces and offers a practical solution to maintain neutrality and uphold his reputation within the student government organization. By recusing himself from the evaluation process and seeking guidance from the ethics committee, Miguel demonstrates a commitment to ethical conduct and transparency.

One positive aspect of this response is the clear action plan outlined to address the conflict of interest. By taking proactive steps to remove himself from the decision-making process and seeking advice, Miguel shows a willingness to prioritize ethical considerations over personal interests.

However, a potential drawback could be the missed opportunity for Miguel to contribute his experience and expertise to the outdoor club's petitioning process. While stepping back is the right ethical choice, Miguel could explore alternative ways to support the club while maintaining impartiality, such as offering guidance informally or helping in non-decision-making capacities.

Overall, the response effectively balances ethical considerations with practical steps for addressing the conflict of interest, but Miguel could consider alternative ways to support the club without compromising his neutrality.
