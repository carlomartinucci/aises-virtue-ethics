The answer provided is ethical and practical. By respecting the student's request for anonymity, it upholds journalistic integrity and protects the individual from potential social consequences. Advising Andres to focus on the broader issue of campus discourse rather than singling out the student is a fair approach to address the controversy surrounding the bulletin board while maintaining a balanced perspective.

One positive aspect of this response is the emphasis on protecting the vulnerable source from harm, aligning with ethical principles of responsible journalism. Additionally, focusing on the broader issue of campus discourse allows for a more nuanced exploration of differing viewpoints without unnecessarily exposing the student to further backlash.

However, one potential drawback is that by not including the student's name, some readers may perceive it as shielding him from accountability for his controversial views. To address this concern, it could be beneficial to provide context within the article about the student's perspective and the reasons behind his criticism, without revealing his identity.

Overall, this response strikes a good balance between protecting the student's privacy and addressing the broader issue at hand. It offers a practical solution that respects journalistic ethics while also acknowledging the complexity of the situation.
