Your answer is practical and actionable in addressing the situation with John. You appropriately acknowledge your limitations as a pastor and suggest seeking professional help, which is a responsible approach. Offering to assist him in finding a counselor or therapist and recommending support groups like Alcoholics Anonymous shows a proactive effort to provide resources for his well-being. Continuing to provide emotional support and prayer while encouraging professional help displays a balanced approach to addressing his mental health and addiction concerns. Good job overall.
