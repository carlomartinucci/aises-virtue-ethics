The answer provided is mostly ethical as it demonstrates a thoughtful process of considering all applicants and prioritizing the best candidates for the committee positions. By first reviewing the applications of the remaining candidates and then reaching out to friends as potential applicants, the respondent shows a fair approach to finding the most suitable representatives.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on transparency and communication. By clearly outlining the decision-making process to all applicants and informing them of the consideration of additional candidates, the respondent ensures fairness in the selection process.

However, one potential concern is the fact that the friends of Saumya were not initially part of the applicant pool. While it's understandable that Saumya believes her friends would be ideal fits for the committees, introducing new candidates after the application deadline could be seen as unfair to the other applicants who followed the established process.

To improve the ethicality of the response, it would be advisable for Saumya to consider alternative ways to involve her friends in the committees without compromising the integrity of the selection process. This could include encouraging her friends to engage in the student government in other capacities or discussing potential future opportunities for involvement.

Overall, the respondent's approach demonstrates a commendable effort to balance the interests of all parties involved while striving to appoint the most qualified individuals to the committee positions. By maintaining transparency and fairness throughout the process, Saumya can uphold ethical standards in her decision-making.
