The suggested course of action for Matt is to privately address the issue with John, expressing his concerns and encouraging him to remove the video. This approach is a good first step in handling the situation. By directly communicating with John, Matt is attempting to address the problem at its source and offer support for making better decisions in the future.

However, there are some shortcomings in this response. While it is important to address the issue privately, there is a risk that John may not take the feedback seriously or may not remove the video. In such a case, Matt may need to consider escalating the matter to higher authorities within the student government or the college administration to ensure that appropriate action is taken. Additionally, the answer does not address the potential consequences for Matt within the organization if he chooses to come forward, which is a crucial aspect to consider in this situation.

In conclusion, the suggested action is a good starting point, but Matt should be prepared to take further steps if necessary and carefully weigh the potential repercussions of his actions within the organization.
