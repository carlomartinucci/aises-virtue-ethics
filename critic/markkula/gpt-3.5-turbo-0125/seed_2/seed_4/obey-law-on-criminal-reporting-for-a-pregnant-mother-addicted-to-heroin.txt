The answer provided is a thoughtful and detailed response to a complex ethical dilemma. The approach of informing the patient about the legal requirements and potential consequences of reporting her drug use while also emphasizing the importance of seeking treatment is a good starting point. It acknowledges the patient's autonomy and the need for her to make informed decisions about her health and the well-being of her baby.

Furthermore, discussing treatment options and developing a comprehensive plan that includes prenatal care, addiction treatment, and parenting support shows a commitment to addressing the patient's needs holistically. The emphasis on providing non-judgmental support and encouragement is also commendable and can help build trust with the patient, which is crucial in supporting her through this challenging situation.

However, one area for improvement could be exploring alternative options beyond the inpatient drug treatment program, as coercion or fear of legal consequences could potentially hinder the patient's willingness to engage in treatment. It would be beneficial to involve the patient in decision-making regarding her treatment plan to ensure it aligns with her goals and values.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a balanced consideration of the ethical complexities involved and offers practical steps to support the patient effectively in addressing her addiction and ensuring the well-being of her baby.
