Your response is specific and actionable, which is good. By scheduling a private meeting with Julia and addressing the issue directly, you are taking a proactive approach to resolving the situation. You are also offering support and assistance, which shows empathy and a willingness to find a solution together. However, it may be beneficial to also involve other members of the student government in the discussion to ensure transparency and accountability. Additionally, emphasizing the potential impact on the organization's budget and setting a good example for other members is a strong point. Overall, your approach is practical and addresses the ethical dilemma effectively. Great job!
