The answer provided is practical and actionable in advising Derek on how to handle the situation with the off-campus fraternities and sororities. It suggests a specific course of action for Derek to take, which involves scheduling a meeting with the Vice Provost to express the students' concerns and propose potential solutions. By emphasizing the importance of addressing the issues faced by the students involved in Greek life, Derek can work towards finding a resolution that considers both student needs and administrative constraints.

However, the answer could be improved by acknowledging the ethical dilemma Derek is facing more explicitly. It would be beneficial to advise Derek on how to navigate the compromise between authenticity and the need for support from the administration. Providing guidance on how to balance these conflicting interests while maintaining integrity would enhance the overall ethical evaluation of the response. Additionally, suggesting ways for Derek to communicate openly with student government leaders about the compromises being made could help him seek support and navigate the situation more effectively.
