The answer provided is generally ethical as it addresses the concerning statements made by the client and emphasizes the importance of boundaries and healthy coping strategies. It also mentions exploring underlying feelings and developing a safety plan if necessary. However, the response could be improved by being more specific about the strategies to address the client's unhealthy thoughts and desires. Providing concrete techniques or interventions to help the client manage rejection and jealousy would make the response more actionable. Additionally, the answer could benefit from a clearer outline of how to involve other mental health professionals or authorities if the client is at risk of acting on his thoughts. Overall, the response is on the right track but could be enhanced by offering more detailed and practical guidance.
