It emphasizes the importance of celebrating the student's life and contributions while also highlighting mental health awareness and resources. The suggestion to avoid sensationalizing the death and instead focusing on open conversations about mental health is commendable. Additionally, the recommendation to include information about helplines and consult with mental health professionals shows a proactive approach to minimizing harm and promoting positive dialogue.

However, the evaluation could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how Hana can ensure that the article does not inadvertently contribute to the risk of suicide contagion. For example, suggesting ways to frame the narrative, language to use, or specific resources to include could enhance the practicality of the advice.
