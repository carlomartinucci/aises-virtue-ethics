The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing the situation with John. It acknowledges the limitations of the pastor's role in dealing with clinical depression and substance abuse, and appropriately suggests seeking professional help. It also offers actionable steps such as assisting in finding a counselor or therapist, recommending support groups like Alcoholics Anonymous, and continuing to provide emotional support.

However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the urgency of the situation given the risk of relapse and potential harm to John's well-being. It would be beneficial to reinforce the importance of immediate action to address his mental health and addiction concerns. Additionally, offering to accompany John to seek help or providing more concrete support in accessing professional resources could further enhance the response.
