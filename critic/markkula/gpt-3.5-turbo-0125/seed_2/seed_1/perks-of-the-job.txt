The answer provided is a good course of action as it addresses the issue directly and attempts to resolve it through communication and offering support. Scheduling a private meeting with Julia shows discretion and respect for her position within the organization. Expressing concerns about the misuse of office resources and emphasizing the importance of following rules are key points that need to be addressed. Offering assistance in finding alternative solutions is a proactive approach to help Julia avoid using the organization's resources for her personal tasks. Reminding her of the impact her actions could have on the organization and the importance of setting a good example is also crucial for maintaining the integrity of the student government.

One potential improvement could be to suggest concrete alternative solutions during the meeting, such as utilizing personal resources for homework or seeking out free resources available on campus. This could provide Julia with practical options to consider and demonstrate a genuine effort to help her address the issue. Additionally, it would be beneficial to follow up after the meeting to ensure that the misuse of office resources has ceased and to offer further support if needed. Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma in a constructive and respectful manner.
