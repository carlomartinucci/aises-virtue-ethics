The answer provided is ethical as it promotes addressing the issue directly with the individual involved and offering support for better decision-making. By choosing to have a private conversation with John first, Matt shows respect for their relationship as fellow senators and allows John the opportunity to rectify the situation before taking further action. Encouraging John to remove the video and discussing the importance of upholding a positive image aligns with maintaining professionalism within the organization.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting that Matt also consider the potential consequences of inaction, such as the impact on the organization's reputation if the video were to become public. It would be beneficial for Matt to think about the broader implications and weigh them against the possible backlash he may face for addressing the issue. Additionally, it might be helpful to advise Matt to document the conversation with John in case further steps need to be taken in the future.

Overall, the answer provides a good starting point for addressing the situation, but could be enhanced by considering the potential outcomes of different courses of action and preparing for further steps if needed.
