The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing the issue of board engagement within the nonprofit organization. By scheduling individual meetings with each board member to discuss their level of engagement and commitment, the executive director is taking a proactive approach to addressing the lack of participation. Communicating the vision and goals of the nonprofit and seeking input from board members on how they can contribute aligns with fostering a sense of ownership and involvement among the board.

Furthermore, the suggestion to explore opportunities for board training and development shows a commitment to helping board members understand their responsibilities and the organization's needs better. This can potentially lead to increased board engagement and effectiveness in moving the nonprofit forward.

However, one aspect that could be improved upon is the need for setting clear expectations and accountability measures for board members moving forward. While discussing their level of engagement is crucial, it's essential to establish concrete goals and responsibilities to ensure everyone is on the same page regarding their roles and contributions. Additionally, addressing any underlying issues that may be hindering board participation, such as conflicts of interest or personal commitments, should also be considered during these meetings.

Overall, the answer provided offers a practical and actionable approach to improving board engagement within the nonprofit organization, but could benefit from a stronger emphasis on setting clear expectations and addressing potential barriers to participation.
