The answer provided is mostly ethical as it prioritizes the well-being of both the patient and the fetus, acknowledges the legal implications, and focuses on providing support and resources for the patient's recovery. 

Good aspects include explaining the legal requirements to the patient, discussing treatment options, and developing a comprehensive treatment plan that includes prenatal care, counseling, and addiction treatment. Emphasizing support and encouragement is also positive.

However, there are areas for improvement. The answer could have delved deeper into the potential consequences of not reporting the drug use, such as the risks to the fetus and the patient's health. Additionally, it could have addressed the importance of ensuring the patient's safety and the possibility of involving a social worker or other professionals to provide additional support. Including a plan for monitoring progress and adjusting the treatment plan as needed would have enhanced the answer's practicality.

Overall, while the answer is ethically sound, it could benefit from a more detailed exploration of potential outcomes and additional safeguards to ensure the patient's and the fetus's well-being.
