The answer provided outlines specific and actionable steps that IKEA could take to address the issue of child labor in its supply chain. By developing a comprehensive supplier code of conduct, implementing regular audits, establishing a dedicated team, providing training, collaborating with relevant organizations, engaging with government authorities, offering remediation for affected children, and communicating transparently, IKEA can make tangible progress in tackling this ethical challenge.

One positive aspect of the proposed actions is the emphasis on proactive measures, such as regular audits and training programs, to prevent and detect child labor violations. Additionally, the suggestion to collaborate with NGOs and government authorities shows a recognition of the need for external support and advocacy in addressing complex labor issues.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of detail on how IKEA plans to ensure the effectiveness of these measures and hold suppliers accountable for compliance. It would be beneficial to include specific mechanisms for enforcement, such as penalties for violations and incentives for adherence to the code of conduct.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the issue of child labor in IKEA's supply chain, but could be strengthened by incorporating more specific enforcement mechanisms and monitoring processes to ensure sustained progress in eradicating child labor.
