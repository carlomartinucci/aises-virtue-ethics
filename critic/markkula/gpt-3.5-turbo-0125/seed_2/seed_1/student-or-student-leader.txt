The proposed solution is a practical and actionable way to address the problem of the two senators with class conflicts. By approaching the affected senators individually and expressing understanding for their predicament, the answer shows empathy and consideration for their academic commitments. The suggestion of designating proxies for the senators to represent their constituents and vote on their behalf during Senate meetings is a proactive solution that ensures the concerns of their constituents are still represented. Additionally, the proposal to have the senators provide input and guidance to their proxies demonstrates a commitment to maintaining their involvement and influence within the organization.

However, a potential downside could be that having proxies may not fully capture the senators' perspectives and priorities, leading to a potential disconnect between the proxies and the senators' original intentions. In addition, the use of proxies could raise concerns about the legitimacy of decision-making if the proxies do not accurately represent the senators' views.

Overall, the proposed solution is a practical way to address the situation, but it is important to carefully consider the potential drawbacks and ensure that the use of proxies is effectively managed to maintain transparency and accountability within the student government organization.
