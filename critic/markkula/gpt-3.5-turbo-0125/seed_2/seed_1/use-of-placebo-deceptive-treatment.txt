The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being of the patient and aims to address his concerns in a compassionate and collaborative manner. 

Positively, the response suggests scheduling a dedicated appointment to discuss the patient's fears, exploring his beliefs, and explaining the medical test results clearly. Furthermore, the suggestion to collaborate with a medical doctor for a physical examination shows a proactive approach to ruling out any underlying medical conditions contributing to the situation. The emphasis on adjusting the treatment approach to address the patient's escalating anxiety and mistrust also demonstrates a willingness to adapt strategies to best support the patient's mental health.

However, to improve the response, it could benefit from more specific details on the cognitive-behavioral techniques and medication adjustments that could be utilized to manage the patient's symptoms. Additionally, a concrete plan on how to build and maintain a trusting therapeutic relationship with the patient over time would enhance the overall effectiveness of the suggested actions.

Overall, the response provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario, but it could be strengthened by incorporating more specific strategies and a detailed plan for ongoing support and treatment.
