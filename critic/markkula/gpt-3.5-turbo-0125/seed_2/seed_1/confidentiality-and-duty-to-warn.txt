The answer provided is specific and actionable, which is commendable. The psychologist outlines a clear plan of action, including addressing the concerning statements, educating the client on the inappropriateness of his thoughts, exploring underlying feelings, and assessing the risk of harm. The emphasis on respecting boundaries and finding healthier coping strategies is important in promoting positive behavior change.

However, a potential area for improvement is to further emphasize the potential consequences of acting on these thoughts, such as the impact on Susan and her boyfriend's well-being, potential legal ramifications, and the client's own future. Additionally, the answer could benefit from mentioning the importance of establishing clear boundaries in the therapeutic relationship to ensure the client understands that such behaviors are not acceptable.

Overall, the response provides a solid foundation for addressing the client's concerning behavior, but could be enhanced by incorporating a more comprehensive discussion on the potential outcomes of acting on these thoughts and the importance of clear therapeutic boundaries.
