The proposed solution is practical and actionable. By convening a meeting with all stakeholders, Maria can gather input and perspectives from different parties involved, which is a good way to understand the issue comprehensively. The idea of creating a separate email list for faculty and staff members to share essential information is a proactive step to address the concerns raised. Setting clear guidelines for the new list's use and involving IT services for implementation are specific actions that can help manage the email volume effectively. Continuing to manage the student events list and including faculty information in the weekly newsletter shows a commitment to balancing the needs of students and faculty members.

One potential improvement could be to proactively seek feedback from students about their preferences regarding email communication to ensure that the proposed changes align with their needs and preferences. Additionally, establishing a feedback mechanism to continuously evaluate and improve the communication process could enhance the effectiveness of the solution in the long run.

Overall, the answer provides a practical plan of action that takes into account the concerns of all stakeholders involved and offers a balanced approach to address the issue.
