The answer provided is mostly ethical. It correctly acknowledges the importance of including the conversation about the statue in the video to accurately reflect student sentiments and maintain transparency. It suggests presenting the topic in a light-hearted and respectful manner, which shows consideration for various viewpoints. Additionally, the emphasis on balancing the coverage by highlighting positive aspects of student life is commendable for providing a fair representation.

However, the evaluation could be improved by suggesting more concrete actions for Carrie to take in order to mitigate potential negative impacts on donor relationships. For instance, she could consider including interviews with university officials or donors to provide their perspective on the statue and the student reactions. This could add depth to the coverage and demonstrate a willingness to engage in constructive dialogue.

Overall, the response is on the right track but could benefit from more specific recommendations on how Carrie can address the potential donor concerns while still maintaining authenticity and transparency in her representation of student conversations.
