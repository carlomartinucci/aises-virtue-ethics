The answer provided is specific and actionable. By suggesting a meeting with the staff members responsible for creating the resources on consent, proposing collaboration with experts in neurodiversity, and recommending tailored training sessions, the responder offers practical steps to address the issue at hand. This approach demonstrates a proactive and constructive way to improve the materials, making them more accessible to neurodiverse individuals and ensuring that all students receive appropriate education on consent.

However, one potential improvement could be to also consider involving neurodiverse students themselves in the review and revision process. Their perspectives and insights could be invaluable in ensuring that the materials are truly effective and inclusive. Additionally, it would be beneficial to establish a system for ongoing feedback and evaluation to continuously improve the resources based on the experiences and needs of the students.

Overall, the answer is commendable for its specificity and actionable steps, but could be further enhanced by incorporating the voices of neurodiverse students and implementing a feedback mechanism for continuous improvement.
