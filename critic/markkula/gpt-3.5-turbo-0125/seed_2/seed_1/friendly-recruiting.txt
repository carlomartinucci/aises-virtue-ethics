The answer provided is a solid response to Saumya's situation. It demonstrates a thoughtful approach to balancing the need for qualified candidates on the committees while also considering the applications of all interested students, including Saumya's friends. The suggestion to review the remaining candidates' applications for potential fits before reaching out to friends shows a commitment to fairness.

The plan to communicate openly about the selection process and criteria, as well as informing all applicants about the consideration of additional candidates, helps maintain transparency and ensures that everyone understands the decision-making process. Evaluating the applications of Saumya's friends based on the same criteria as the initial applicants is a fair way to assess their suitability for the roles.

One improvement could be to involve a neutral party in the final decision-making process to add an extra layer of objectivity and prevent any potential bias towards Saumya's friends. This would further enhance the transparency and fairness of the selection process.

Overall, the response provides a practical and actionable approach to addressing Saumya's dilemma, emphasizing fairness and quality in the selection of student representatives for the university committees.
