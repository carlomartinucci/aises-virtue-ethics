The answer provided is ethical as it considers various important factors such as honoring the deceased classmate, raising awareness about mental health, minimizing harm, and avoiding sensationalism. By advising Hana to cover the story in a sensitive and responsible manner, the response acknowledges the potential impact of the coverage on the audience while also recognizing the importance of destigmatizing mental health issues. 

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on celebrating the student's life and contributions, which can help shift the focus from the tragic event to his positive impact on the campus community. Additionally, the suggestion to include information about helplines and mental health resources demonstrates a proactive approach to providing support for those in need.

However, a potential improvement could be to provide more specific guidance on how Hana can collaborate with mental health professionals or organizations to ensure that the coverage is handled appropriately. This would not only enhance the credibility of the article but also ensure that accurate information and resources are shared with the readers.

Overall, the answer offers a balanced perspective on the ethical considerations involved in covering sensitive topics like suicide, and provides actionable steps for Hana to follow in order to create a meaningful and responsible piece of journalism.
