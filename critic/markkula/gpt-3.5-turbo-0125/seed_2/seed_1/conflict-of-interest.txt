The answer provided is ethical as it addresses the potential conflict of interest that Miguel faces and offers a practical solution to mitigate it. By recusing himself from any involvement in the evaluation process and seeking guidance from the ethics committee, Miguel demonstrates a commitment to upholding the integrity of the decision-making process.

One positive aspect of this answer is the clear and specific action steps outlined, such as informing relevant parties and seeking guidance from the ethics committee. These actions show a proactive approach to addressing the conflict of interest.

However, one improvement could be to also consider ways in which Miguel can continue to support the outdoor club in a non-decision-making capacity. For example, he could provide guidance or mentorship to other members of the club who are leading the petition process, ensuring that his expertise is still utilized while maintaining neutrality.

Overall, the answer is practical and actionable, providing a clear course of action for Miguel to navigate the situation ethically.
