The proposed solution is practical and addresses the issue at hand effectively. By suggesting the use of proxies for the two senators with class conflicts, it ensures that their constituents' concerns are still represented and allows the senators to fulfill their academic commitments. The approach of discussing the situation with the senators individually shows empathy and understanding towards their predicament.

However, one potential downside of this solution is that having proxies may not fully capture the senators' personal perspectives and insights during discussions and decision-making processes. It may also raise questions about the legitimacy of voting through proxies in a student government setting.

To improve the solution, it would be beneficial to establish clear guidelines and protocols for how proxies should operate, ensuring transparency and accountability in the decision-making process. Additionally, encouraging the senators to stay engaged and provide guidance to their proxies can help maintain a sense of continuity and representation for their constituents.

Overall, the proposed solution is a practical way to address the conflict between academic commitments and student government responsibilities, but it could be strengthened by implementing additional measures to maintain the senators' active involvement and representation in the Senate.
