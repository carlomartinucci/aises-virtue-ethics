The answer provided is fairly ethical. It emphasizes the importance of open communication, active listening, and finding common ground between the Executive Cabinet and the Senate. It suggests practical steps such as scheduling separate meetings and facilitating dialogue to address the conflict. Encouraging collaboration and unity within the student government organization is also highlighted, which is positive.

However, the answer could be improved by offering more specific strategies on how to navigate the differing perspectives and reach a compromise. Providing concrete examples of potential compromises or conflict resolution techniques would enhance the practicality of the response. Additionally, addressing the power dynamics at play and how to navigate them in a fair and transparent manner could further strengthen the ethical approach.
