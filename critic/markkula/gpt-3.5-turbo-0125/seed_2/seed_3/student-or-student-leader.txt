The proposed solution is practical and addresses the issue at hand by offering a way for the two senators to remain engaged in their roles despite their scheduling conflicts. It shows empathy towards the senators' academic commitments while also recognizing the importance of their roles within the student government. By suggesting the use of proxies and outlining a process for ensuring proper representation of constituents, the answer demonstrates a proactive approach to problem-solving.

However, a potential drawback of this solution is that it may raise concerns about the legitimacy of decision-making if proxies are allowed to vote on behalf of the absent senators. It is crucial to establish clear guidelines and mechanisms to ensure that proxies act in the best interests of the constituents and do not abuse their voting power.

Overall, the proposed solution is a good starting point for addressing the issue, but it would benefit from further consideration of potential challenges and safeguards to maintain the integrity of the decision-making process within the student government.
