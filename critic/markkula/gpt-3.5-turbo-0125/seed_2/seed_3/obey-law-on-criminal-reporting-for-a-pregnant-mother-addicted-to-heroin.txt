The answer provided is a good starting point in addressing the complex ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. It appropriately considers the patient's situation, motivations, and the legal requirements involved. The suggestion to explain the legal requirements and potential consequences to the patient is essential in ensuring transparency and informed decision-making.

Moreover, discussing treatment options and developing a comprehensive plan that includes prenatal care, addiction treatment, and parenting support demonstrates a holistic approach to addressing the patient's needs. Providing non-judgmental support and encouragement is also commendable in building a trusting relationship with the patient.

However, the answer could be improved by explicitly addressing the potential harms of reporting the patient's drug use, such as the risk of criminal charges and involvement of child protective services leading to the removal of the baby. It is important to weigh the benefits of mandated reporting for immediate access to treatment against the potential negative consequences for the patient and her child.

Additionally, the answer could be enhanced by exploring alternative pathways that prioritize the patient's well-being and success in overcoming her addiction without the coercive elements of the legal system. Emphasizing the importance of patient autonomy and collaboration in decision-making could further strengthen the ethical framework of the response.
