The answer provided is ethical as it promotes transparency, accountability, and fairness in decision-making. By choosing to recuse himself from the evaluation process and seeking guidance from the ethics committee, Miguel demonstrates a commitment to upholding integrity and avoiding conflicts of interest.

One positive aspect of this approach is that it prioritizes the integrity of the decision-making process and ensures that the outdoor club's application is evaluated objectively. By taking proactive steps to address the potential conflict of interest, Miguel shows a willingness to uphold the principles of fairness and neutrality within the student government.

However, one potential drawback of this approach is that Miguel may miss out on the opportunity to contribute his expertise and experience to the evaluation process, which could have been beneficial for the outdoor club. It is important for Miguel to find a balance between his roles and responsibilities to ensure that he can continue to support the growth of both the student government and the outdoor club in a transparent and ethical manner.

In conclusion, while the decision to recuse himself is ethical and aligns with principles of integrity and impartiality, Miguel should also consider exploring alternative ways to support the outdoor club while maintaining a clear separation of roles within the student government. This will help him navigate the situation effectively and foster a positive reputation within the organization.
