The answer provided is a practical and actionable approach to addressing the issue at hand. By scheduling individual meetings with each board member, the executive director can effectively communicate the organization's vision and goals, solicit input, and address concerns about board engagement. This strategy also emphasizes the importance of board training and development to enhance their understanding of their roles and responsibilities.

However, the answer could be improved by incorporating a more proactive approach to address the lack of attendance at board meetings and the strategic planning retreat. The executive director should consider implementing measures to ensure better board participation, such as setting clear expectations for attendance and actively following up with board members who consistently miss meetings.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for improving board engagement and moving the organization forward, but it could benefit from a more robust strategy to address specific issues related to board participation.
