The answer provided is a practical and actionable approach to the situation. By suggesting that Matt should privately communicate with John about his concerns, it emphasizes addressing the issue directly and attempting to resolve it internally. Encouraging John to remove the video and discussing the importance of upholding a positive image demonstrates a proactive approach to dealing with the situation. Offering support to John in making better decisions also shows empathy and a willingness to help him improve.

However, the answer could be improved by also mentioning the potential consequences of John's actions, such as legal implications for underage drinking and the impact on the organization's reputation. It would be beneficial for Matt to consider discussing these aspects with John to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the seriousness of the situation. Additionally, the answer could suggest seeking guidance from a higher authority within the student government if the situation escalates or if John does not respond positively to the conversation.

Overall, the answer provides a good starting point for Matt to address the issue with John in a constructive manner, but it could be strengthened by including a more thorough evaluation of the potential outcomes and involving appropriate authorities if necessary.
