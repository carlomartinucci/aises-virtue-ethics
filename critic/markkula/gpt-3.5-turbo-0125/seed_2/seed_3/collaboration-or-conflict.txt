The proposed course of action is a good starting point for addressing the situation. Scheduling a meeting with Alanna to have an open and honest conversation about the challenges is a practical step towards resolving the issues at hand. Expressing appreciation for past collaborations and acknowledging the importance of the partnership demonstrates a positive approach. 

Listening to Alanna's perspective and trying to understand her concerns is a good way to build empathy and foster better communication. Proposing a concrete plan of action with specific steps and timelines is also commendable as it provides a clear direction for moving forward. Offering assistance and support to alleviate RHA's workload shows a willingness to collaborate and find solutions together.

However, the response could be further improved by emphasizing the importance of mutual respect and understanding in the collaboration. It would be beneficial to address any underlying issues that may be causing the communication breakdown and work towards rebuilding trust between the two organizations. Additionally, considering potential compromises or alternative solutions to accommodate RHA's busy schedule could help find a mutually agreeable way forward without jeopardizing the partnership.

Overall, the proposed actions show a proactive and thoughtful approach to resolving the situation, but further emphasis on building trust, understanding each other's perspectives, and exploring compromises would enhance the effectiveness of the response.
