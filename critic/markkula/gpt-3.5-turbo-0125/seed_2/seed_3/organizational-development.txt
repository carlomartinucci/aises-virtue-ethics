The answer provided is ethical as it suggests exploring alternative funding options for the retreat before diverting money from programs that directly benefit the student body. This shows a consideration for the broader impact on student programs while still valuing the importance of the retreat for student government leaders. The recommendation to seek out sponsors, donors, fundraising events, grants, or scholarships is practical and actionable, providing Carlos with specific steps to take in order to address the financial challenge.

However, it would have been beneficial to also suggest that Carlos communicate openly with the student government members about the situation. By involving them in the decision-making process, he could potentially gain support for exploring alternative funding options and showcase transparency in his leadership. Additionally, it would be helpful to emphasize the importance of evaluating the cost-benefit of the retreat in relation to its impact on the student government and the broader student body, ensuring that the decision is made with a clear understanding of the trade-offs involved.
