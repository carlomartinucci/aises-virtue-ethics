The answer provided is comprehensive and takes into account the ethical considerations involved in the scenario. It acknowledges the importance of addressing mental health openly and honestly, particularly in the medical field, where patient care is paramount. The response emphasizes the need for transparency in seeking treatment and highlights the risks associated with not disclosing mental health history, both for Sophie's well-being and for her future patients. Encouraging Sophie to pursue therapy alongside medication is a positive approach, as it aligns with best practices for managing depression.

On the positive side, the answer respects Sophie's autonomy and confidentiality by not disclosing her information without consent. It provides practical guidance on how to support Sophie in finding appropriate treatment and underscores the significance of accurately documenting her medical history, including the reason for prescribing antidepressants.

However, a potential drawback is that the answer could have delved deeper into the specific ethical principles at play, such as beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. By explicitly addressing how these principles relate to the decision-making process, the answer could have been even more actionable and informative.

Overall, the response effectively balances empathy for Sophie's situation with a commitment to upholding professional standards and ethical responsibilities. It offers practical steps for managing the complex ethical dilemmas present in the scenario, making it a well-rounded and ethical approach to the situation.
