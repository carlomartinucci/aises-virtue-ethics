Your answer is specific and actionable, which is commendable. You have proposed concrete steps to address the issue at hand by directly engaging with the sexual assault prevention center and suggesting collaboration with experts in neurodiversity. This shows a proactive approach to improving the accessibility and inclusivity of the materials on consent.

One area for improvement could be to also consider involving neurodiverse individuals themselves in the revision process. Their perspectives and insights would be invaluable in ensuring that the resources are truly effective and relevant to their needs. Additionally, you could propose implementing feedback mechanisms to regularly gather input from neurodiverse students on the revised materials to ensure ongoing improvement and relevance.

Overall, your response demonstrates a practical and specific plan of action to address the issue, but there is room to further enhance inclusivity and effectiveness by involving neurodiverse individuals in the revision process and implementing feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement.
