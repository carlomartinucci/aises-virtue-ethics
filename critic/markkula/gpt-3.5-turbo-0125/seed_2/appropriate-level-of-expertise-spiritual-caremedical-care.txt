The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being of John and acknowledges the limitations of the pastor's expertise in addressing clinical depression and substance abuse. It offers practical steps by suggesting finding a counselor or therapist, attending support group meetings, and continuing to provide emotional support and prayer.

To improve the response, it could be more actionable by providing specific resources or contacts for professional help, such as local mental health clinics or helplines specializing in depression and addiction. Additionally, the pastor could offer to accompany John to his first appointment with a counselor or therapist to provide support and encouragement. Encouraging John to involve his family in the process of seeking help could also be beneficial in creating a strong support system for him.
