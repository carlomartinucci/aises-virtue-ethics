The answer provided is ethical because it emphasizes addressing the issue directly with John and offering support to help him make better decisions in the future. It recognizes the importance of maintaining a professional image for the student government organization while also showing concern for John's well-being.

The good aspects of this answer include the focus on resolving the issue privately and constructively, rather than immediately resorting to public shaming or reporting John to higher authorities. It highlights the importance of mentorship and support in guiding fellow leaders to make better choices.

However, a potential drawback is that it does not address the potential consequences of John not taking the feedback well or refusing to remove the video. Matt should be prepared to escalate the situation if necessary, perhaps by involving other senior members of the organization or seeking guidance from a faculty advisor.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable approach for Matt to address the situation while balancing ethical considerations and the professional reputation of the student government organization.
