The answer provided suggests several actionable steps for Mary to consider in navigating the complex situation with her family business. The suggestion to explore all possible options, including finding new tenants or repurposing the building, is a practical approach to potentially generating revenue without resorting to selling the building. Additionally, recommending open communication and collaboration with her brother Donald shows a positive emphasis on addressing concerns directly and working towards a compromise.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how Mary can approach these conversations effectively. For instance, outlining strategies for negotiating with Donald, such as conducting a formal valuation of the business to determine a fair buyout price, would offer more concrete steps for Mary to take. Furthermore, addressing the potential ethical considerations, such as fairness in valuing minority shares and the impact on family relationships, in more detail would enhance the overall evaluation.

Overall, the answer offers a good foundation for Mary to begin addressing the challenges within the family business, but could benefit from more specific and detailed actions to guide her decision-making process effectively.
