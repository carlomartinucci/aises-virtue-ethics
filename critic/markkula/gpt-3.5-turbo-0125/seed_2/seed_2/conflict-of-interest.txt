The answer provided is ethical as it addresses the conflict of interest Miguel faces and offers a practical solution. By recusing himself from the evaluation process and seeking guidance from the organization's ethics committee, Miguel demonstrates a commitment to upholding integrity and transparency in his roles.

One positive aspect of the answer is the clear and decisive action recommended - recusing oneself is a straightforward way to address conflicts of interest. Seeking guidance from the ethics committee also shows a willingness to adhere to established guidelines and seek advice when needed.

However, one improvement could be to also suggest that Miguel communicates openly with both the outdoor club and the student government about his decision to recuse himself. This transparency can help maintain trust and understanding from both parties involved.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable solution to the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining impartiality and seeking guidance when facing conflicting roles.
