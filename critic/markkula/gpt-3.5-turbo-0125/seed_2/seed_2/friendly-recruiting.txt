The answer provided is generally ethical as it attempts to balance the need for qualified representatives on the committees with transparency and fairness in the selection process. By first reviewing the applications of the remaining candidates and considering their potential suitability for the specific committees, the answer demonstrates an effort to give all applicants a fair chance. Additionally, reaching out to friends to encourage them to apply only after exhausting other options shows a good intention to find the best candidates for the positions.

However, the answer could be improved by explicitly stating that the friends should go through the same application process as the other candidates, including submitting their qualifications and being evaluated based on the same criteria. This would further ensure fairness and transparency in the selection process. Additionally, the answer could have emphasized the importance of documenting the decision-making process and criteria used for selecting committee representatives to provide a clear rationale for the final decisions.

In conclusion, the answer is ethical in its approach to balancing the needs of the committees with fairness to all applicants, but could be enhanced by specifying that friends should go through the same application process and emphasizing the importance of documenting the decision-making process.
