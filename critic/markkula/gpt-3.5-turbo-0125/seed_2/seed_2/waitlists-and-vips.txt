The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes fairness and inclusivity by proposing a solution that ensures equal opportunity for all students who missed out on purchasing tickets. By suggesting a lottery system to allocate the extra tickets, the answer addresses the issue of limited availability while maintaining transparency and avoiding favoritism towards Callie's friends.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific steps on how to implement the proposed solution effectively. For example, detailing how the announcement to the senior class should be made, how the lottery system would be conducted, and how the winners would be notified could enhance the practicality of the response. Additionally, considering potential challenges or objections that may arise from the school administration or the senior class could help anticipate and address any issues that may arise during the implementation of the solution.
