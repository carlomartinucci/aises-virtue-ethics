The proposed solution to designate proxies for the senators facing class conflicts is a practical and actionable way to address the situation. It shows empathy towards the senators' academic commitments while also ensuring that their constituents' concerns are still represented in the Senate meetings. By involving the affected senators in the decision-making process and seeking approval from the Senate, the proposed solution promotes transparency and fairness.

However, there are potential drawbacks to consider. Allowing proxies may raise concerns about the legitimacy of decisions made in the senators' absence, as proxies may not fully understand the concerns of the constituents they are representing. There could also be challenges in ensuring that the proxies accurately convey the senators' perspectives and intentions.

To improve the proposed solution, it would be beneficial to establish clear guidelines and expectations for the proxies, such as requiring regular communication with the senators and providing a mechanism for feedback from the senators on the proxies' actions. Additionally, it may be helpful to explore alternative options, such as recording meetings for the absent senators to review or finding ways to accommodate their schedules without changing the meeting time.

Overall, the proposed solution is a good starting point for addressing the conflict between academic and extracurricular commitments, but further considerations and refinements may be necessary to ensure effective representation and decision-making in the student government.
