The answer provided is ethical as it proposes specific and actionable steps for IKEA to address the issue of child labor in its supply chain. The actions outlined focus on developing a comprehensive supplier code of conduct, implementing regular audits, establishing a dedicated team, providing training, collaborating with external organizations, engaging with government authorities, providing support for affected children, and maintaining transparency in communication.

The good aspects of this response include its emphasis on proactive measures to prevent child labor, such as setting clear expectations for suppliers, conducting regular audits, and providing training for employees. Collaborating with local NGOs and advocating for stronger enforcement of labor laws are also positive steps towards addressing the root causes of child labor. Additionally, the focus on remediation and support for affected children shows a commitment to not only stopping child labor but also to improving the well-being of those impacted.

However, a potential drawback could be the lack of specific details on how IKEA plans to enforce the code of conduct and ensure compliance from suppliers. It would be beneficial to include more information on the consequences for violations and how audits will be conducted effectively. Additionally, while advocating for stronger enforcement of labor laws is important, the response could provide more information on how IKEA plans to hold both suppliers and governments accountable if violations persist.

Overall, the response offers a solid framework for addressing child labor in IKEA's supply chain but could benefit from additional details on enforcement mechanisms and accountability measures to ensure effectiveness in combating this critical issue.
