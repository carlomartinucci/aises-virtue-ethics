The answer provided is ethical in terms of protecting the student's anonymity and focusing on the broader issue of campus discourse. By respecting the student's request for privacy, the answer demonstrates a consideration for the potential consequences the student may face due to the public backlash. Additionally, advising Andres to shift the focus of the article towards the broader issue of differing viewpoints on campus discourse is a practical way to address the controversy without exposing the student to further harm.

However, one potential drawback of this approach is that it may be perceived as shielding the student from accountability for his controversial views. While the student made a choice to post publicly, the decision to delete the post and request anonymity indicates some level of recognition of the potential repercussions. By not disclosing the student's name, it could be argued that accountability is being circumvented.

To improve the response, it would be beneficial to suggest that the student could issue a public apology or clarification regarding his original post, taking responsibility for the impact of his words. This would demonstrate accountability while still respecting his privacy. Encouraging open dialogue and reflection on the consequences of one's actions could lead to a more balanced and nuanced approach in addressing controversial issues.
