The answer provided is practical and actionable in addressing the issue of board engagement within the nonprofit organization. By scheduling individual meetings with each board member, the executive director can assess their level of commitment and discuss the organization's vision for growth. Communicating the goals and potential impact of the nonprofit can inspire board members to become more involved. Asking for their input and addressing any concerns shows a willingness to listen and collaborate with the board.

Furthermore, exploring opportunities for board training and development is a proactive approach to increasing their understanding of their roles and responsibilities. This can help board members feel more equipped to contribute meaningfully to the organization's success.

However, one aspect that could be improved is setting clear expectations and accountability measures for board members following these discussions. It would be beneficial for the executive director to establish specific goals and metrics to track progress towards increased engagement. Additionally, considering potential consequences for continued lack of engagement could help incentivize board members to take their roles more seriously.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the issue of board engagement within the nonprofit, but could benefit from incorporating more concrete steps for accountability and follow-up to ensure lasting improvement.
