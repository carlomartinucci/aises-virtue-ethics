Your answer is practical and specific, providing a clear course of action for Marcus to consider. By suggesting the appointment of a candidate not directly tied to any of the election campaigns, you aim to promote balance, diversity, and fairness within the executive cabinet. This approach could indeed help mitigate potential biases or conflicts that might arise from appointing only candidates from the election.

However, one aspect that could be improved is the consideration of the potential impact on organizational unity. While it is important to prioritize fairness and inclusivity, Marcus should also weigh the value of including his opponents for the sake of unity, as mentioned in the scenario. Finding a way to balance both the need for diversity and unity could lead to a more effective decision-making process and stronger organizational cohesion.

Overall, your answer provides a solid foundation for Marcus to make a thoughtful and strategic decision, but it could benefit from a more nuanced approach that takes into account the broader goals of organizational unity alongside fairness and inclusivity.
