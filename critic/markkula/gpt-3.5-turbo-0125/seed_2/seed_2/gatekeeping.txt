Your proposed solution is well-thought-out and addresses the concerns of all stakeholders involved in the situation. By convening a meeting with representatives from various groups and proposing the creation of a separate email list for faculty and staff, you demonstrate a commitment to finding a fair compromise that benefits both students and faculty members.

One positive aspect of your solution is the emphasis on open communication and collaboration among stakeholders. This approach can help build consensus and ensure that everyone's perspectives are taken into account. Additionally, creating clear guidelines for the new email list and working with IT services to set it up effectively demonstrate a practical approach to implementing your proposal.

However, one potential drawback is the risk that managing two separate email lists could create additional work for you and potentially lead to confusion or overlap in communication. To address this, you may want to consider establishing clear boundaries between the two lists and developing a streamlined process for managing and monitoring them.

Overall, your solution is ethical, practical, and actionable, and it shows a good understanding of the complexities involved in the scenario. By implementing your proposed plan, you have the potential to improve communication and meet the needs of both student organizations and faculty members effectively.
