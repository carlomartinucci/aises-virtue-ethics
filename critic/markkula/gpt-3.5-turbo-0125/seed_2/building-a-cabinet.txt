The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of balance, diversity, fairness, and inclusivity in decision-making within the student government organization. By suggesting to appoint a candidate not directly tied to any of the election campaigns for the third spot in the executive cabinet, it aims to prevent biases and conflicts that could arise from appointing only candidates from the election. This approach also demonstrates a commitment to fairness and inclusivity, which are crucial values in organizational leadership.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how Marcus can ensure that the appointed candidate not tied to any of the election campaigns is qualified and capable of contributing effectively to the executive cabinet. It would be beneficial to suggest a process for identifying and selecting such a candidate, such as conducting interviews or reviewing applications from a diverse pool of potential candidates. Additionally, offering advice on how Marcus can communicate this decision transparently and effectively to all stakeholders involved would enhance the practicality of the answer.
