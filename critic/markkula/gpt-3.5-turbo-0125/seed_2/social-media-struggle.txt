The answer provided is a practical and actionable approach to the situation. It acknowledges the potential consequences of reporting John's actions while also emphasizing the importance of maintaining a professional image as a student leader. By suggesting that Matt privately address the issue with John and offer support in making better decisions, the answer promotes constructive dialogue and mentorship rather than punitive measures.

One positive aspect of this approach is that it prioritizes communication and mentorship, which can potentially lead to a positive outcome for both Matt and John. By addressing the issue privately, Matt can express his concerns without immediately resorting to formal consequences, allowing for a more nuanced and understanding conversation.

However, a potential drawback of this approach is that it relies heavily on John's willingness to listen and take action. There is a risk that John may not take Matt's concerns seriously or may choose not to remove the video, which could lead to further complications down the line.

Overall, the answer provides a balanced and practical solution to the dilemma faced by Matt. It encourages open communication and support while also addressing the importance of upholding a professional image within the student government organization.
