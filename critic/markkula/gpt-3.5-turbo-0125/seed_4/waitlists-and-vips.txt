By rectifying the errors in data entry and creating a waiting list, all seniors are given an equal chance to attend Senior Ball, including those who were initially turned away.

While it is acknowledged that Callie is pressed for time with various event preparations, it would be beneficial to provide specific suggestions on how she can manage her time more efficiently to accommodate creating a waiting list. Offering practical tips or delegating tasks to others could help Callie balance her responsibilities and still ensure a fair ticket distribution process. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of upholding ethical standards even in challenging circumstances would strengthen the response.
