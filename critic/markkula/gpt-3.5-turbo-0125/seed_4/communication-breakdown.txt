Your advice to Derek is practical and actionable. Organizing a town hall meeting or forum dedicated to addressing the concerns of students involved in off-campus Greek life is a proactive step towards giving these students a voice and potentially influencing the Vice Provost's perspective. Collaborating with other student government leaders to gather data and evidence adds credibility to the students' concerns and can help in persuading the administration to reconsider their stance.

However, it would be beneficial to also suggest that Derek communicate openly with the Vice Provost about the importance of discussing Greek life issues, emphasizing the impact it has on a significant portion of the student body. Encouraging Derek to find a balance between advocating for student needs and maintaining a positive relationship with the administration would be a valuable addition to your advice. Additionally, highlighting the importance of transparency and honesty in all interactions, even when faced with conflicting interests, would further enhance the ethical dimension of the solution.
