The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of considering privacy implications, consulting legal experts, and engaging in transparent communication with the public. These actions demonstrate a commitment to upholding ethical standards and respecting the rights of individuals. By advising city leaders to carefully review the proposal, seek legal guidance, and involve the community in decision-making, the response promotes accountability and ethical behavior.

However, the answer could be improved by offering more specific recommendations on how to address potential privacy concerns and ensure data protection. For instance, suggesting the implementation of strict access controls, data anonymization techniques, and regular audits to monitor compliance with privacy laws would enhance the practicality of the response. Additionally, providing guidance on establishing clear guidelines for data retention and deletion would further strengthen the ethical framework of the proposed solution.
