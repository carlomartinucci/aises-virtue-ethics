Your response is specific and actionable, providing a clear course of action for addressing the ethical issue at hand. By suggesting a private meeting with Julia to discuss the misuse of office resources, expressing concerns, and proposing alternative solutions, you are taking a proactive approach to resolving the situation. Emphasizing the importance of transparency and accountability is also a good way to highlight the ethical implications of Julia's actions.

However, one potential drawback is that the response does not address the possibility of Julia reacting negatively to the confrontation, which could impact Anthony's relationship with her and potentially create tension within the student government. It may be beneficial to consider strategies for handling such a scenario in case Julia does not respond positively to the discussion.

Overall, your response is practical and provides a constructive way to address the ethical dilemma while promoting accountability and integrity within the organization.
