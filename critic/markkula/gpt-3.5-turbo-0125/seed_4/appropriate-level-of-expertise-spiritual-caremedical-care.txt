The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being of John and offers practical steps to address his mental health and potential relapse into alcoholism. By expressing concern, emphasizing the importance of seeking professional help, and offering to accompany him to appointments, the answer shows a genuine effort to support John in a difficult time. Additionally, suggesting support groups tailored to his needs and continuing to provide emotional support and check-ins demonstrate a holistic approach to his situation.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the potential ethical dilemma of respecting John's autonomy while also ensuring his safety. It would be beneficial to explore ways to gently persuade John to reconsider seeking professional help, especially given the seriousness of his situation. Providing more specific strategies on how to navigate this delicate balance would enhance the answer's practicality and effectiveness.
