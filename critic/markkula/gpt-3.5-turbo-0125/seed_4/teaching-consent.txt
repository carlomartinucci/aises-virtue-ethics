The answer provided is specific, practical, and actionable. By scheduling a meeting with the director of the sexual assault prevention center, presenting data, and proposing concrete steps to revise the materials, the responder demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing the issue. The suggestion of involving neurodiverse students in the revision process shows a commitment to inclusivity and effectiveness.

However, the response could be improved by also considering the potential need for additional training or resources for staff members at the center to better support neurodiverse students in understanding consent. It would be beneficial to address this aspect in the proposed plan to ensure a comprehensive approach to the issue.

Overall, the answer is commendable for its clear steps and consideration of inclusivity, but could be enhanced by incorporating a plan for staff training to better support neurodiverse students.
