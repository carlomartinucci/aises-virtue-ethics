The answer provided is ethical as it encourages Grace to be transparent and proactive about her situation. By having an open conversation with senior members of the student government, Grace can address the potential impact of her early graduation on the organization and work towards finding a solution that benefits both parties. The suggestion to propose potential solutions, such as finding a replacement or ensuring a smooth transition, shows a practical approach to resolving the issue.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how Grace can navigate the conversation effectively. For example, advising her to emphasize her commitment to the organization, highlight the initiatives she has planned, and demonstrate her willingness to support a smooth transition can help her make a stronger case for continuing her involvement despite her early graduation. Additionally, suggesting that Grace seek input from other members of the student government on potential solutions could help her gather support and address any concerns they may have.

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for Grace to address her situation ethically, but could benefit from more specific guidance on how to approach the conversation and involve other members in finding a solution.
