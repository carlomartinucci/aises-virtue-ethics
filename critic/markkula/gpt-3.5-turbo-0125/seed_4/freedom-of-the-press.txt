The answer provided is ethical as it encourages Carrie to include the topic of the new statue and student jokes in her video while maintaining transparency and authenticity. By acknowledging the humor and opinions surrounding the statue and presenting differing perspectives, Carrie can provide a balanced representation of student conversations. Additionally, suggesting to include positive aspects or alternative viewpoints related to the statue shows a fair approach to the topic.

However, the answer could be improved by offering more specific strategies for how Carrie can navigate the potential impact on donor relations. For instance, she could consider framing the discussion in a constructive manner that focuses on the importance of student expression while also highlighting the positive impact of alumni contributions. By proactively addressing potential concerns and showcasing a comprehensive view of the topic, Carrie can demonstrate sensitivity to donor relations while still upholding the authenticity of student conversations.
