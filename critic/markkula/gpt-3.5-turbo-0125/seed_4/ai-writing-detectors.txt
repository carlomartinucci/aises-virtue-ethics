The answer provided is practical and actionable in addressing the ethical concerns raised by the scenario. By convening a team of experts to review and improve the AI detection model, the response demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing the issues of false positives, especially for non-native English speakers. Collaborating with educational institutions and researchers to gather feedback shows a commitment to enhancing the tool's effectiveness and minimizing the risk of unfair accusations of plagiarism.

However, the answer could be further improved by specifying concrete steps that the team of experts would take to improve the model's accuracy. For example, conducting thorough data analysis to identify patterns leading to false positives, implementing targeted adjustments to the algorithm, or incorporating language-specific features to better detect AI-generated content from non-native English speakers. Additionally, outlining a clear timeline for these improvements and establishing a transparent communication plan with stakeholders would enhance the overall effectiveness of the proposed actions.
