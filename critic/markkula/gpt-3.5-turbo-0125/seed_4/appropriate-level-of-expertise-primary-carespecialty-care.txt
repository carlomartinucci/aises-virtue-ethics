Your answer is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being of the patient and emphasizes the importance of seeking specialized care from a psychiatrist for a potential serious psychiatric condition. You acknowledge the limits of your expertise and the necessity of proper evaluation and treatment by a specialist. Providing information, offering assistance in finding a psychiatrist, and ensuring ongoing support for the patient are all positive actions that demonstrate your commitment to Peter's health.

To improve, you could consider addressing Peter's resistance to seeing a psychiatrist more directly. It may be helpful to explore the reasons behind his reluctance and address any concerns or fears he may have about seeking psychiatric help. Additionally, you could involve Peter's family in the conversation, given their supportive role in his life, to help encourage him to consider the importance of specialized care for his well-being. This approach could further strengthen the support system around Peter and increase the likelihood of him seeking the necessary help.
