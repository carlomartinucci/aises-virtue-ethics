The answer provided is a practical and actionable approach to the situation. It acknowledges the complexity of the dilemma Matt is facing and offers a specific course of action for him to take. By suggesting that Matt privately communicate his concerns to John and offer support, it shows a willingness to address the issue directly while also considering John's perspective and potential need for guidance.

One positive aspect of this answer is that it prioritizes open communication and attempts to resolve the issue internally before escalating it further. By approaching John in a private and supportive manner, Matt can potentially address the behavior without causing unnecessary conflict within the organization.

However, a potential downside of this approach is that it relies heavily on John's willingness to acknowledge and rectify his actions. There is a risk that John may not take the feedback seriously or may react negatively, which could leave Matt in a difficult position moving forward.

Overall, the answer provides a reasonable and actionable solution for Matt to address the situation while considering the potential consequences of his actions. It encourages proactive communication and support, which are positive steps towards resolving the issue in a professional and respectful manner.
