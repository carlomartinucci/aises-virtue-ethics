The answer provided is a good starting point for Olivia's situation. Seeking advice from a mentor or advisor and consulting the university's code of conduct are practical steps to take in order to gain perspective on the ethical implications of her actions. The emphasis on transparency, integrity, and aligning campaign preparations with ethical standards is commendable.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting more concrete actions Olivia could take to address the potential ethical concerns. For example, recommending specific ways to involve the rest of the ASI executive team in the planning process or proposing alternative strategies for boosting her public appeal that do not rely on delaying events could provide Olivia with actionable steps to navigate the situation more effectively.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of seeking guidance and upholding ethical standards, but could benefit from more specific and actionable recommendations for Olivia to consider in order to address the ethical dilemma she is facing.
