The answer provided is specific and actionable, offering practical steps for Mary to navigate the challenging situation with her brother regarding the family business. By suggesting that Mary engage in a candid conversation with Donald to discuss their differing viewpoints and propose a compromise solution, the answer encourages open communication and collaboration. Additionally, the recommendation to highlight the financial implications of selling the building and seek advice from a financial advisor demonstrates a strategic approach to decision-making.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the potential emotional and relational aspects of the situation more explicitly. Emphasizing the importance of empathy, understanding, and preserving family relationships alongside financial considerations would provide a more holistic approach to the ethical considerations at play. Furthermore, offering specific strategies for managing potential conflicts and maintaining family harmony would enhance the practicality of the response.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for Mary to approach the dilemma with her brother, but could benefit from a more comprehensive exploration of the emotional and relational dimensions of the decision-making process.
