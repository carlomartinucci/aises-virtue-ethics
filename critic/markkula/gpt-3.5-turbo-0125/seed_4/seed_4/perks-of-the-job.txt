Your response is specific and actionable, providing a clear course of action for addressing the ethical dilemma at hand. By suggesting a private meeting with Julia to discuss the issue, you show a willingness to address the problem directly and professionally. You also emphasize the importance of adhering to rules and guidelines while acknowledging Julia's hard work and dedication, which is a balanced approach.

However, your response could benefit from being more assertive in advocating for a resolution that prioritizes the organization's budget and the ethical use of resources. While suggesting alternative solutions or compromises is a good idea, it would be helpful to provide some specific examples or options during the meeting to guide the discussion towards a concrete outcome. Additionally, reinforcing the consequences of not rectifying the situation and the potential harm it could cause to the organization would add more weight to your argument.

Overall, your response is a good starting point for addressing the ethical dilemma, but incorporating more assertiveness and specific solutions would make it even more effective in resolving the issue.
