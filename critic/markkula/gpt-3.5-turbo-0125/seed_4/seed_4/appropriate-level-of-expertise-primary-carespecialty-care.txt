Your response is well-considered and ethical. You appropriately acknowledge your limitations as a primary care physician and emphasize the importance of seeking specialized care for a potential serious psychiatric condition like bi-polar disorder. By providing information about the benefits of seeing a psychiatrist, offering to assist in finding one, and ensuring ongoing support, you are taking proactive steps to prioritize Peter's well-being.

One suggestion for improvement would be to address Peter's resistance more directly. It may be beneficial to explore his reasons for refusing to see a psychiatrist and work collaboratively to address any concerns or fears he may have about seeking specialized care. By engaging in open dialogue and actively listening to his perspective, you can potentially help Peter feel more comfortable and empowered in making the decision to seek psychiatric evaluation.

Overall, your response is practical, specific, and actionable, demonstrating a commitment to the ethical principle of beneficence by prioritizing Peter's mental health needs.
