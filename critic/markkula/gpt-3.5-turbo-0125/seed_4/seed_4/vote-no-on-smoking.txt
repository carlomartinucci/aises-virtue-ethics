The answer provided is a practical and actionable approach to handling the situation. By scheduling a meeting with the university administration to gather more information and discuss their concerns, Talia demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing the issue. Additionally, holding a town hall meeting to involve her constituents in the decision-making process shows a commitment to representing their interests.

However, the answer lacks a clear stance on the ethical considerations at play. While it is important to consider legal implications and student rights, the answer does not explicitly address the ethical implications of potentially going against the wishes of the student body. It would be beneficial for Talia to also reflect on the ethical aspects of her decision-making process and how it aligns with her role as a senator representing the students.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for gathering information, engaging with stakeholders, and making an informed decision. To improve, I would recommend incorporating a more explicit discussion of the ethical considerations involved in this scenario. This would help ensure that Talia's decision-making process is well-rounded and considers all relevant factors.
