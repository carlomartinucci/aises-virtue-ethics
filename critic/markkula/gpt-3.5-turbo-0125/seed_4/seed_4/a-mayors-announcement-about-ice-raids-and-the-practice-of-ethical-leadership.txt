Your response is well-structured and considers multiple aspects of the situation involving Mayor Schaaf's announcement. By acknowledging the complexity of the scenario and proposing a systematic approach to investigating the legality and impact of her actions, you demonstrate a methodical and objective perspective.

One strength of your response is your emphasis on conducting a thorough investigation to gather all relevant information and consult legal experts, which is crucial in addressing the legal and ethical implications of Mayor Schaaf's decision. This approach shows a commitment to understanding the situation fully before taking any action.

However, one area for improvement is the lack of specific actions or recommendations for addressing the issues identified. While your proposed investigation is a solid foundation, providing more specific suggestions on how to handle the legal and ethical considerations would enhance the practicality of your response.

Overall, your response is detailed and analytical, but it would benefit from more actionable steps or recommendations for addressing the complex ethical and legal concerns raised in the scenario.
