Your proposed course of action is commendable as it focuses on rectifying the errors, creating a fair opportunity for all seniors to attend the event, and prioritizing inclusivity. By creating a waiting list and randomly drawing names from those who respond, you ensure fairness in the ticket distribution process. This approach demonstrates integrity and ethical decision-making by considering the needs of the entire senior class rather than just Callie's friends.

However, one potential downside could be the time constraint. While it is understandable that Callie may feel overwhelmed with the upcoming event preparations, it is essential to prioritize fairness and inclusivity over convenience. Taking the extra step to create a waiting list and draw names from the respondents may require additional effort, but it is crucial in upholding the ethical principles of fairness and equal opportunity for all seniors.

To improve your response, you could suggest delegating some of the event preparation tasks to other members of the student government to free up time for creating the waiting list. This way, Callie can balance both the event logistics and the ticket distribution process effectively, ensuring a successful and inclusive Senior Ball for all seniors involved.
