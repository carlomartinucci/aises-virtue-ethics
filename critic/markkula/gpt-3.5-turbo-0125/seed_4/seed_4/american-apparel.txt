The answer provided is fairly ethical in its approach. By reviewing the company's code of conduct and policies, conducting an internal investigation, and collaborating with HR and legal teams to take appropriate disciplinary actions, the responder demonstrates a commitment to upholding ethical standards and addressing misconduct effectively. Additionally, the emphasis on transparent communication with employees, stakeholders, and the public shows a dedication to accountability and maintaining trust.

However, the evaluation could be improved by offering more specific actions that could be taken during the internal investigation and disciplinary process. Providing concrete steps, such as interviewing witnesses, collecting evidence, and ensuring due process in the disciplinary actions, would enhance the response's practicality and effectiveness. Additionally, outlining a plan for preventing similar incidents in the future, such as implementing additional training and monitoring mechanisms, would further strengthen the ethical response.
