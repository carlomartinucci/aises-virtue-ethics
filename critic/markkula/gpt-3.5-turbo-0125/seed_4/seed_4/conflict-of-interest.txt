The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes transparency, seeking guidance, and considering recusal to avoid conflicts of interest. By disclosing the dual roles to both parties and discussing possible solutions, Miguel is taking a proactive approach to address the situation. Seeking guidance from club leadership and student government advisors shows a willingness to navigate the issue responsibly. The suggestion of temporarily stepping back from the active role in the club while still supporting its growth behind the scenes is a practical way to maintain the integrity of both roles.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific actions that Miguel could take to ensure a clear separation between his roles. For instance, Miguel could establish clear boundaries between his involvement in the club and his responsibilities in student government, such as delegating specific tasks to other club members or abstaining from decision-making processes related to the club's petition. Additionally, Miguel could actively communicate with both parties to address any concerns or perceptions of bias that may arise.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the ethical considerations involved in Miguel's situation and offers practical steps to navigate the conflict of interest effectively. By implementing more specific actions to establish boundaries and communication strategies, Miguel can better address the potential challenges and maintain the integrity of both roles.
