The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes fairness and impartiality in the funding process. By declining to meet with Alex to review his proposal personally, Drake is avoiding potential conflicts of interest and ensuring equal opportunities for all student clubs and societies. This decision upholds the integrity of the funding process and maintains professionalism in his role as Finance Commissioner.

One positive aspect of the response is the clear communication of the reasoning behind the decision. By explaining the importance of impartiality and fairness to Alex, Drake is helping him understand the ethical considerations at play. Additionally, offering to provide general guidance and clarification on the process shows a willingness to support Alex within the boundaries of fairness.

However, a potential improvement could be to suggest alternative ways for Alex to seek assistance, such as group workshops or additional resources that could benefit all student organizations equally. Providing proactive solutions can enhance the support offered to students while upholding ethical standards.

Overall, the response effectively addresses the ethical dilemma by prioritizing fairness and impartiality. By emphasizing the importance of following established procedures and offering alternative forms of guidance, Drake is taking appropriate steps to uphold ethical standards in his role.
