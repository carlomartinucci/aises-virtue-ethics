The answer provided is a good starting point for addressing the ethical concerns raised by the situation involving the Diversity in Faces dataset released by IBM Research. 

Positively, the suggestion to conduct an internal review to assess the selection and annotation process demonstrates a commitment to understanding what went wrong and how to prevent similar issues in the future. Additionally, reaching out to individuals whose photos were included in the dataset to offer them the option of removal shows a proactive approach to addressing privacy concerns.

However, there are areas for improvement. The response could benefit from more concrete steps on how IBM will ensure transparency in data usage and removal processes. This could involve creating a clear and accessible process for individuals to request the removal of their photos and ensuring that such requests are honored promptly. 

Furthermore, while collaborating with ethics and data privacy experts is a good idea, the response could be strengthened by specifying how these experts will be involved in the development and release of future datasets to prevent similar issues from arising. 

Lastly, updating the IBM Research website with detailed information is crucial, but it would be beneficial to outline specific information that will be provided to enhance transparency and rebuild trust with the public.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical concerns surrounding the Diversity in Faces dataset, but it could be enhanced by providing more specific and detailed steps for ensuring ethical data collection and usage in the future.
