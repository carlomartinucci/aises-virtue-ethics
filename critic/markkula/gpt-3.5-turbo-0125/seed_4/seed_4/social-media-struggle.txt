The answer provided is a good starting point for Matt to address the situation. It encourages direct communication with John to express concerns and offer support, which is a positive step towards resolving the issue internally. By emphasizing the importance of upholding a professional image and following rules as a representative of the student government, Matt is advocating for accountability and integrity within the organization.

However, the answer lacks specificity in terms of potential consequences or additional steps that Matt could take if John does not respond positively to the conversation. It would be beneficial to include a plan for escalating the issue if necessary, such as involving a higher authority within the student government or seeking guidance from a faculty advisor.

Overall, the answer is ethical in its approach of addressing the issue privately and offering support to John, but it could be improved by providing a more detailed plan for handling the situation if initial communication with John is not successful.
