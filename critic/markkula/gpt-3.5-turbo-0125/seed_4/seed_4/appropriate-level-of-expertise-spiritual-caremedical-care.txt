The answer provided is generally ethical, as it prioritizes the well-being of the individual and suggests actions that could help John address his mental health and addiction issues. The answer correctly emphasizes the importance of seeking professional help and offers practical suggestions such as accompanying John to therapy sessions and connecting him with support groups. Additionally, the answer maintains a supportive and empathetic approach by continuing to provide emotional support and checking in regularly.

However, there are areas for improvement. The answer could be more specific in outlining steps to help John in case he continues to refuse professional help. It could suggest alternative resources or strategies to address his depression and potential relapse. Furthermore, the answer could address the potential ethical dilemma of respecting John's autonomy while also ensuring his safety and well-being. Implementing a plan to address these concerns would further enhance the ethical response in this situation.
