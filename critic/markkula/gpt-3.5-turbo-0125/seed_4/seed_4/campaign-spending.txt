The answer provided is ethical as it suggests that James should limit his campaign spending to level the playing field for Alix. By reallocating funds from extravagant items to more equitable initiatives, James can demonstrate integrity and fairness in the election process. This approach balances the need to run an effective campaign with the ethical responsibility to ensure fairness and equal opportunity for all candidates.

Additionally, outlining a plan for how James can communicate his decision to limit spending to his supporters and demonstrate his commitment to ethical campaigning would enhance the practicality of the advice given.
