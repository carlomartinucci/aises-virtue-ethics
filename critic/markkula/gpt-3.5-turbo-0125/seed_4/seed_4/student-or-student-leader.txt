The answer provided is practical and actionable, offering specific steps to address the issue at hand. Meeting with the senators individually to discuss potential solutions shows a proactive approach to finding resolutions. The suggestions of petitioning the professor for flexibility, identifying a proxy for the junior senator, and proposing remote participation options demonstrate creativity and consideration for all parties involved.

One positive aspect of the response is the focus on finding alternative ways for the senators to stay engaged with Senate activities, ensuring that they can continue to fulfill their duties despite their scheduling conflicts. This shows a commitment to inclusivity and support for the senators who are facing challenges.

However, one potential drawback is the reliance on the professors' flexibility and the availability of trusted proxies. While these solutions are worth exploring, they may not always be feasible or guaranteed to work. It would be beneficial to have contingency plans in case these initial steps do not yield the desired outcomes.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to reconciling the problem, emphasizing communication, collaboration, and adaptability. By implementing the proposed solutions and being prepared to adjust as needed, the student government can uphold its commitment to serving all members effectively.
