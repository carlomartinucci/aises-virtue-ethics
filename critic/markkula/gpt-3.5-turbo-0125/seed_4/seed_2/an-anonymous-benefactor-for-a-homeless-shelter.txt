The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it acknowledges the need for due diligence when receiving large donations, especially from individuals with potentially controversial backgrounds. By expressing gratitude to the donor, respecting her wish for anonymity, and seeking further information and guidance from superiors, the response demonstrates a commitment to transparency and accountability.

However, the answer could be improved by being more specific in outlining the steps to be taken during the due diligence process. For instance, it could mention conducting background checks on the donor, verifying the legality of the donation, and ensuring compliance with any legal requirements. Additionally, it could address the potential impact on the organization's reputation and relationships with other donors if the donation is accepted.

Overall, the response is a good starting point, but it could benefit from a more detailed plan of action and consideration of broader implications beyond just organizational procedures.
