The answer provided is practical and actionable. It suggests a course of action for Matt to address the issue by directly communicating with John, expressing concerns about the video, and offering support. This approach prioritizes internal resolution and maintaining professionalism within the organization. By addressing the issue privately first, Matt can potentially resolve the situation without escalating it unnecessarily.

However, the answer could be improved by also suggesting that Matt should document the situation in case further action is needed. Additionally, it may be beneficial to advise Matt to consider the potential consequences of not addressing the issue, such as the negative impact on the organization's reputation and the ethical implications of turning a blind eye to underage drinking.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the situation, but could benefit from including additional steps to ensure a more comprehensive and proactive approach.
