The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing Miguel's dilemma. By suggesting immediate disclosure of his dual roles, seeking guidance from relevant parties, and considering recusal from decision-making processes, the response demonstrates a proactive approach to managing the potential conflict of interest. The recommendation to explore the option of temporarily stepping back from the active role in the club while still supporting its growth is a balanced solution that prioritizes integrity and transparency.

However, while the answer offers clear steps for Miguel to take, it could have elaborated further on the potential impact of his decision on the club's petitioning process and his reputation within both the club and student government. Providing more insight into the consequences of each course of action would have strengthened the evaluation by highlighting the importance of maintaining trust and fairness in both roles.

Overall, the response provides a solid foundation for Miguel to address his ethical dilemma effectively, but could benefit from expanding on the implications of his choices to offer a more comprehensive evaluation.
