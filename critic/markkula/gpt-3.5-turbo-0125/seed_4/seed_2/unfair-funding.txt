This response provides specific and actionable steps for Claire to address the issue of potential bias in funding allocations within the student government. By suggesting that Claire holds a meeting with the entire funding committee to discuss the problem openly and transparently, the answer promotes communication and collaboration among committee members. The proposal to implement a rotation system for reviewing funding requests and establishing clear evaluation criteria is practical and can help ensure impartial decision-making and fairness in the distribution of funds.

However, one potential drawback is the lack of consideration for Garret's feelings and potential reactions to the proposed changes. While it is essential to address the issue of bias, Claire should also handle the situation delicately to avoid undermining Garret's contributions and dedication to the student government. It would be beneficial to incorporate a strategy to involve Garret in the decision-making process and seek his input on implementing changes that promote fairness and transparency.

Overall, this response offers a solid plan of action for Claire to address the funding allocation issue effectively. To improve, it could include suggestions on how to involve Garret in the proposed changes and address any potential challenges that may arise during the implementation process.
