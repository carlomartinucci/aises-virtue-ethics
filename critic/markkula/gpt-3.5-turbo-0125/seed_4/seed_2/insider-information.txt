The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes fairness and impartiality in the funding process for all student clubs and societies. By refusing to meet with Alex individually to review his proposal, Drake demonstrates a commitment to upholding professional ethics and preventing any potential conflicts of interest. The response also offers a practical solution by suggesting alternative ways to support Alex, such as answering general questions or providing clarification on available guidelines.

However, the answer could be improved by offering more specific suggestions on how Drake could help Alex without compromising fairness. For example, Drake could consider hosting group workshops or information sessions to provide guidance to multiple student organizations simultaneously. This would ensure that all groups have access to the same level of support and advice, promoting fairness and transparency in the funding process.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a sound ethical stance and provides a practical solution to the dilemma presented in the scenario. By incorporating more specific recommendations for alternative forms of support, the response could further enhance its effectiveness in promoting fairness and equality among student organizations.
