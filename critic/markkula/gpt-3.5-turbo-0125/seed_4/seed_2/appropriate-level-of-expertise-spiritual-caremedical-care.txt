The answer provided is generally ethical as it prioritizes the well-being of John and offers practical steps to support him. It acknowledges the limitations of the pastor's role in addressing clinical depression and substance abuse, emphasizing the importance of seeking professional help. The suggestion to accompany John to a therapy appointment and encourage him to join a support group shows a proactive approach to providing additional resources for his specific challenges.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific details on how to handle the situation if John continues to refuse professional help. It would be beneficial to outline potential steps for escalating the situation if his condition worsens or if there are signs of imminent harm to himself or others. Additionally, setting clear boundaries and discussing the limits of the pastoral role in addressing mental health and addiction issues could be included to manage expectations effectively.

Overall, the answer is on the right track by focusing on practical steps to support John while recognizing the need for professional intervention. Enhancing the response with more detailed strategies for addressing possible resistance to seeking help and establishing boundaries would further strengthen the ethical approach in this scenario.
