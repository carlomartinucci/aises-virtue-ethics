The answer provided is ethical and practical. It correctly identifies the need to prioritize Adam's safety and well-being above other considerations, such as public perception or trust. By suggesting that Jessica explain the potential risks to Adam and assure him that his safety will be respected, the answer shows empathy and a commitment to ethical journalism practices. Furthermore, the recommendation to discuss the situation with the editor, Anthony, is a proactive step in finding a solution that respects Adam's wishes while still upholding journalistic integrity.

One improvement could be to suggest specific ways in which Jessica can verify the credibility of the information shared by Adam without revealing his identity. This could involve corroborating his story through other sources or providing context and background information to support the claims made in the article. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of maintaining Adam's trust and confidentiality throughout the process would further strengthen the ethical approach to handling this sensitive situation.
