The suggested course of action is practical and specific, demonstrating a proactive approach to addressing the issue at hand. By scheduling a meeting with key stakeholders and proposing a compromise solution, Maria is actively seeking input from all parties involved and attempting to find a balanced resolution. This approach acknowledges the concerns about email volume impacting student engagement and offers a feasible alternative to ensure important information reaches students without overwhelming them.

One positive aspect of this approach is the emphasis on open communication and collaboration among stakeholders, which can lead to a more inclusive decision-making process. By exploring alternative communication channels for faculty members to reach students, Maria is also showing a willingness to adapt and find creative solutions to meet the needs of all parties involved.

However, one potential area for improvement is to more clearly outline the specific steps that will be taken following the meeting to implement the proposed compromise solution. Providing a detailed plan of action, including timelines and responsibilities, can help ensure that the agreed-upon solution is effectively put into practice.

Overall, the suggested approach is a good starting point for addressing the ethical dilemma faced by Maria in a practical and actionable manner. By continuing to prioritize open communication and collaboration while also focusing on concrete steps for implementation, Maria can work towards finding a resolution that balances the needs of students, faculty, and student organizations effectively.
