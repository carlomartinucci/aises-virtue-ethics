The answer provided is a good starting point in addressing the issue of misuse of office resources. It acknowledges the importance of raising concerns and addressing the situation directly with Julia, which is commendable. The approach of emphasizing the rules and guidelines, as well as the impact on the organization's budget, shows an understanding of the ethical implications involved.

However, the answer could be improved by being more specific about potential consequences if the behavior continues. It would be beneficial to outline potential steps that may need to be taken if Julia does not cooperate or change her behavior after the initial discussion. Additionally, providing more concrete suggestions for alternative solutions or compromises could make the approach more actionable and practical in resolving the situation effectively.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the ethical dilemma and proposes a solid course of action, but it could be enhanced by including more specific details and potential outcomes to ensure a more effective resolution of the issue.
