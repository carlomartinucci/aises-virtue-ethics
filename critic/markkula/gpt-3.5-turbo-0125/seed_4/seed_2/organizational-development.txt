The answer provided is practical and actionable, as it suggests specific steps for Carlos to take in order to address the issue of the increased cost of the retreat. By exploring alternative funding sources such as reaching out to other campus organizations, seeking sponsorships from local businesses, and organizing fundraising events, Carlos can potentially find a solution that allows the retreat to continue without affecting programs that benefit the student body.

One positive aspect of the answer is that it emphasizes the importance of exploring options beyond pulling money from programs that directly benefit the student body. By proactively seeking alternative funding sources, Carlos can demonstrate resourcefulness and a commitment to finding a solution that minimizes the impact on other important programs.

However, a potential downside is that the answer does not address the possibility that these alternative funding sources may not be successful in covering the increased cost of the retreat. It would be beneficial to also consider a contingency plan in case these efforts do not yield the desired results.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable approach for Carlos to consider, but it could be strengthened by including a backup plan in case alternative funding sources do not fully address the financial challenge.
