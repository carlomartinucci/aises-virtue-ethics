The proposed actions in response to the situation regarding the Diversity in Faces dataset released by IBM Research are specific and actionable, which is a positive aspect. Conducting an internal review to assess the selection process, reaching out to individuals included in the dataset, and collaborating with ethics experts demonstrate a proactive approach to addressing the concerns raised.

However, the plan lacks a clear timeline for these actions, which could lead to delays in addressing the issues promptly. Additionally, the suggestion to update the website with detailed information is good, but it would be beneficial to also include a public apology or acknowledgment of the oversight in handling the dataset.

Overall, the response is a good starting point in addressing the ethical concerns surrounding the dataset, but improvements could be made by setting specific deadlines for each action and emphasizing transparency and accountability throughout the process.
