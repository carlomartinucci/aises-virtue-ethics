It recommends conducting a thorough review of the product's psychological implications and consulting child psychologists and experts in child development to assess the risks associated with gamifying exercise and setting up a reward system tied to a virtual character's emotions.

Providing actionable steps for addressing the concerns raised would enhance the practicality and effectiveness of the response.
