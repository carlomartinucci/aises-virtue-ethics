The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes transparency, seeking guidance, and considering recusal to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. By disclosing the dual roles to both parties and discussing possible solutions, Miguel is taking proactive steps to address the situation. Seeking guidance from club leadership and student government advisors shows a willingness to navigate the issue responsibly. Recusing himself from the decision-making process regarding the club's petition demonstrates a commitment to upholding neutrality and fairness.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific actions Miguel could take to mitigate the conflict of interest. For example, outlining a clear plan for how Miguel can support the club's growth behind the scenes while temporarily stepping back from an active role would add practicality to the response. Additionally, suggesting ways for Miguel to communicate his decision to both parties effectively would enhance the overall effectiveness of the proposed solution.
