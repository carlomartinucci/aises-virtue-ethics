The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes fairness and impartiality in the funding process for all student clubs and societies. By declining to meet with Alex personally to review his proposal, Drake is upholding professional ethics and avoiding the potential conflict of interest that could arise from providing specific advice to a close friend. The suggestion to offer general guidance and clarification on the funding process demonstrates a commitment to maintaining transparency and equal opportunities for all student organizations.

However, the response could be improved by offering more proactive solutions to support all student organizations, not just Alex's club. Drake could consider hosting workshops or information sessions to provide guidance to multiple groups simultaneously, ensuring that all students have access to the same level of support and resources. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of following the established procedures could be strengthened by providing examples of how adherence to guidelines benefits the entire student body and fosters a fair and competitive environment.

Overall, the answer effectively addresses the ethical dilemma at hand by promoting fairness and impartiality in the funding process. To enhance the response, Drake could consider implementing broader support mechanisms to assist all student organizations and reinforce the importance of following established procedures for the benefit of the entire student community.
