The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing the scenario faced by Marcus. It correctly emphasizes the importance of evaluating candidates based on their qualifications, experience, and potential contributions to the executive cabinet. Prioritizing the overall goals and needs of the student government organization is a good approach to decision-making in this situation. Additionally, the suggestion to select a candidate who complements the existing team members to create a balanced and cohesive cabinet is a sound strategy.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more concrete examples of how Marcus could assess the strengths and weaknesses of the candidates, as well as how he could effectively communicate his decision to all parties involved. Offering specific steps or criteria for evaluating candidates and outlining a clear communication plan would enhance the practicality of the response.

Overall, the answer is on the right track but could benefit from more detailed and actionable suggestions to help Marcus navigate this complex decision-making process effectively.
