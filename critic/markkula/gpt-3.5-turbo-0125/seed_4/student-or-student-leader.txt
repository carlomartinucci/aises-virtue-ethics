The answer provided is ethical as it seeks to find practical solutions to the problem while considering the individual circumstances of the senators involved. By meeting with the senators individually and exploring options such as petitioning the professor for flexibility and identifying a proxy, the answer shows a commitment to finding ways for the senators to remain engaged despite their class conflicts. The proposal to allow remote participation through technology also demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing the issue.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on communication and collaboration with all stakeholders, including the senators, other Senate members, and potentially the professors involved. This inclusive approach can help build understanding and support for the proposed solutions.

However, one potential drawback is the lack of consideration for the potential challenges or limitations of implementing remote participation technology. It would be beneficial to address any logistical or technical issues that may arise and have contingency plans in place.

Overall, the answer provides practical and actionable steps to reconcile the problem, showing a thoughtful and ethical approach to finding solutions that prioritize the senators' ability to fulfill their duties while balancing their academic commitments.
