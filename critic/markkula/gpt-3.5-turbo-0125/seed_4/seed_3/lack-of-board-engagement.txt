The answer provided is a good starting point for addressing the issue of board engagement within the nonprofit organization. By scheduling individual meetings with each board member to understand their perspectives and motivations, the executive director shows a commitment to building relationships and fostering open communication. Communicating the vision for the organization's growth and the importance of board engagement is crucial for aligning everyone towards common goals.

Furthermore, seeking input from board members on increasing their involvement and addressing any concerns or barriers demonstrates a collaborative approach to problem-solving. Exploring opportunities for board training or education can help enhance their understanding of their roles and responsibilities, ultimately leading to more effective governance.

However, the answer could be improved by including specific strategies for implementing the proposed actions. For example, setting a timeline for the individual meetings, outlining a plan for board training sessions, and establishing clear expectations with measurable goals for board engagement would make the approach more actionable and results-oriented.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for addressing the issue of board engagement within the nonprofit organization, but could benefit from more specific and detailed action steps to ensure successful implementation.
