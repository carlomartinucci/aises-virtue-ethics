The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes transparency, communication, and seeking guidance to navigate the potential conflict of interest. By disclosing his dual roles and discussing possible solutions with both parties, Miguel is taking proactive steps to address the situation. Recusing himself from the decision-making process and considering stepping back temporarily from the club demonstrate a commitment to upholding integrity and avoiding any perception of bias.

To improve the response, it would be beneficial to suggest specific ways in which Miguel can support the club's growth behind the scenes while temporarily stepping back from his active role. This could involve mentoring new leaders, providing guidance on trip planning, or assisting with organizational tasks to ensure the club continues to thrive during his absence. Additionally, outlining a plan for rejoining the club in the future once the conflict of interest is no longer present would add clarity to the proposed course of action.
