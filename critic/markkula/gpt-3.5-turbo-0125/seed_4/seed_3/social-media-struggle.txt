The answer provided is a practical and actionable approach to the situation. It acknowledges the complexity of the dilemma Matt faces, considering both the potential consequences of speaking up and the importance of upholding professional standards in a leadership role. By suggesting a private conversation with John to address the issue directly and offer support, the answer provides a constructive way for Matt to handle the situation while maintaining integrity and promoting a positive image for the student government.

However, one potential improvement could be to also advise Matt to document the situation in case further action is needed in the future. Keeping a record of the conversation with John and any subsequent developments could help protect Matt and the student government if the situation escalates or if John fails to address the issue appropriately.

Overall, the answer offers a balanced approach that addresses the ethical dilemma effectively and provides a practical solution for Matt to navigate the situation with professionalism and integrity.
