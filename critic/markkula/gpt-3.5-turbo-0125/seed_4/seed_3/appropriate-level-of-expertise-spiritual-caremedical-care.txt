Your response is practical and action-oriented, which is good. You correctly identify the need for professional help and suggest concrete steps for John to take, such as seeking therapy and joining a support group. Offering to accompany him to an appointment shows genuine concern and support. Continuing to provide emotional support and checking in regularly are also positive steps to ensure John's well-being.

However, a potential improvement could be to address the immediate risk of alcohol relapse more directly. You could suggest alternative coping mechanisms or activities that could help him manage stress without turning to alcohol. Additionally, offering resources within the church community, such as connecting him with a mentor who has overcome addiction or organizing activities that promote mental health and well-being, could provide additional support for John.

Overall, your response is a good starting point, but could be enhanced by addressing the immediate risk of relapse and providing more specific resources within the church community for ongoing support.
