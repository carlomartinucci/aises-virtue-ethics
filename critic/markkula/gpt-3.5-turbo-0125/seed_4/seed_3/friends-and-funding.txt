The answer provided is ethical as it suggests recusing oneself from the decision-making process due to a conflict of interest. By acknowledging the personal relationship with Emily and the potential bias it may introduce, Angela is demonstrating a commitment to fairness and transparency in the decision-making process. Furthermore, communicating this decision to the Senate helps maintain integrity within the student government.

However, one downside to this approach is the potential delay in the vote due to the lack of a quorum, which could be frustrating for all involved. In such cases, it might be beneficial for Angela to explore alternative solutions that could prevent the delay while still ensuring fairness in the decision-making process. For example, she could seek guidance from a faculty advisor or suggest a temporary proxy vote to proceed with the meeting while maintaining transparency.

Overall, while the proposed action is ethical and aligns with principles of fairness and integrity, exploring ways to address potential delays without compromising transparency could enhance the effectiveness of the decision-making process.
