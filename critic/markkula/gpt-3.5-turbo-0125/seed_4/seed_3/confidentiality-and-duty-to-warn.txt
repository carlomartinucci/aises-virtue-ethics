Your response is specific and practical, outlining clear steps to address the client's concerning behavior. You correctly emphasize the potential harm in the client's fantasy and highlight the importance of setting boundaries and exploring the underlying reasons for his actions. Your suggestion to involve other mental health professionals or authorities if necessary demonstrates a proactive approach to ensuring the safety of all individuals involved. However, you could improve by providing more specific examples of healthier coping strategies or interventions that could be employed in this situation. Additionally, offering guidance on how to monitor and assess the client's progress in addressing these harmful impulses would enhance the practicality of your response. Overall, your answer is a good starting point but could benefit from more detailed and actionable recommendations.
