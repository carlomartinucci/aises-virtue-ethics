The answer provided is ethical as it suggests a balanced approach where Carrie includes the topic of the new statue and student jokes in her video while also considering the potential impact on donor relations. By acknowledging the humor and opinions surrounding the statue, Carrie maintains transparency and authenticity in representing student conversations. Additionally, the suggestion to include positive aspects or alternative viewpoints related to the statue helps provide a fair representation of the overall campus sentiment.

One positive aspect of this approach is that it upholds the value of openness and genuine representation of student discussions, which is important for the student government in reflecting the concerns and opinions of the student body. By presenting a balanced view, Carrie can navigate the potentially sensitive issue while still fulfilling her role effectively.

However, one potential drawback is that even with a balanced presentation, there is still a risk of negative repercussions from the university administration and donors who may not appreciate the inclusion of such a controversial topic. To address this, Carrie could have explored ways to mitigate these risks further, such as seeking approval or guidance from higher authorities before finalizing the video content.

Overall, while the answer provides a thoughtful and ethical solution, there could be room for further consideration of potential consequences and proactive measures to minimize any adverse impacts on donor relations or university reputation.
