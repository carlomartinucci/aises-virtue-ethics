It starts with a one-on-one meeting to discuss concerns and understand Jamie's perspective, which is a good way to open up communication and foster collaboration. Setting clear expectations and deadlines for improvement is a proactive step to address the issues. Additionally, offering support and resources shows a level of understanding and willingness to help Jamie overcome his challenges.
