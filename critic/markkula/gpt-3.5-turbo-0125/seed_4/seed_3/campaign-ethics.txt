The response provided offers practical steps for Olivia to take in her situation. Seeking advice from a mentor or advisor, consulting the university's guidelines, and considering adjustments to her approach demonstrate a thoughtful approach to addressing the ethical concerns raised by Olivia's actions. The emphasis on transparency and integrity is commendable as it highlights the importance of ethical conduct in navigating this situation.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples of potential adjustments Olivia could make to mitigate the perception of unfairness. For instance, suggesting concrete actions such as disclosing her campaign intentions to the ASI executive team or revisiting the timing of the events in relation to the election period would enhance the practicality of the advice given.

Overall, the response offers a solid foundation for Olivia to address the ethical dilemma she faces, but could benefit from greater specificity in suggesting actionable steps for her to take in order to uphold ethical standards and maintain fairness in the election process.
