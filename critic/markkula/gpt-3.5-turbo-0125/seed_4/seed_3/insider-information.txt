The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of maintaining impartiality and fairness in the funding process for all student clubs and societies. By refusing to meet with Alex personally to review his proposal and instead offering general guidance and clarifications on the guidelines available online, Drake ensures that there is no conflict of interest and that all student organizations have equal opportunities.

The good aspect of this response is that it upholds the principles of fairness and transparency in the funding process. By prioritizing the equal treatment of all student clubs and societies, Drake maintains the integrity of the system and avoids giving unfair advantages to any particular group.

However, a potential improvement could be to also offer to provide general advice sessions or workshops for all student clubs and societies to ensure that everyone has access to guidance and support. This proactive approach could help address the issue of not being able to meet with every group individually while still providing valuable assistance to all student organizations.

Overall, the response is clear, practical, and actionable in addressing the ethical dilemma faced by Drake in a fair and transparent manner.
