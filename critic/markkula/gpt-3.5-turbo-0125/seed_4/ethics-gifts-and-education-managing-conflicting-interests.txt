The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of adhering to the institution's policies of fairness and equal treatment for all students. By declining the offer of tickets and reiterating the available options within the existing services, Adam maintains integrity and professionalism in handling the situation. The suggestion to explore alternative ways to support Judith's learning progress without compromising fairness demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing the parents' concerns.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific strategies for offering additional support within the group learning program. For example, Adam could propose creating a personalized learning plan for Judith or arranging for periodic progress reviews to ensure her educational needs are being met effectively. These actionable steps would enhance the practicality of the solution and further demonstrate Adam's commitment to providing the best educational opportunities for all students while respecting cultural norms and maintaining fairness.
