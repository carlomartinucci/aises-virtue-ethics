The answer provided is practical and actionable in addressing the ethical dilemma faced by Carlos. By suggesting alternative funding sources such as reaching out to other campus organizations, seeking sponsorships, and organizing fundraising events for the retreat, the response offers concrete steps for Carlos to explore before resorting to pulling money from programs that benefit the student body. This approach demonstrates a commitment to finding a solution that balances the needs of the student government leaders with those of the broader student body.

However, one potential drawback of this answer is that it does not address the possibility that these alternative funding sources may not be sufficient to cover the increased cost of the retreat. It would be beneficial to acknowledge this potential limitation and provide additional suggestions for how Carlos could navigate this scenario if alternative funding sources do not fully offset the expenses.

Overall, the answer is practical and provides actionable steps for Carlos to consider in addressing the dilemma, but could be strengthened by acknowledging potential challenges and offering additional contingency plans.
