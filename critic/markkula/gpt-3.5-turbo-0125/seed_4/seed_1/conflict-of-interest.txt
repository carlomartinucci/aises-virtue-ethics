The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes transparency, seeking guidance, and considering recusal to avoid conflicts of interest. By disclosing the dual roles to both parties and discussing possible solutions, Miguel is taking proactive steps to address the situation. Seeking advice from club leadership and student government advisors shows a willingness to navigate the issue responsibly. Considering stepping back from the club temporarily also demonstrates a commitment to upholding the integrity of both roles.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting concrete actions that Miguel could take to mitigate the conflict of interest further. For example, Miguel could delegate his responsibilities within the club to others temporarily while maintaining oversight to ensure continuity. He could also establish clear boundaries and communication channels between his roles to prevent any perceived bias or favoritism. Additionally, Miguel could document his decisions and reasoning transparently to demonstrate accountability and fairness in his dual positions. By taking these additional steps, Miguel can more effectively manage the potential conflict of interest and uphold his reputation as a dedicated member of both the outdoor club and Associated Students.
