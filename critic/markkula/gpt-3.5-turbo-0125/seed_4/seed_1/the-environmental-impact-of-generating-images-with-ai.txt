The answer provided is practical and actionable in addressing the issue of environmental impact caused by image generation using AI. By collaborating with tech companies to implement features that inform users about the energy and water consumption associated with generating images, awareness can be raised among users. Encouraging users to optimize their instructions to reduce the carbon footprint is a proactive step in promoting environmentally friendly practices. 

One positive aspect of this approach is that it leverages the existing platforms and user behavior to educate and incentivize environmentally conscious actions. By integrating these features directly into the image-generation tools, it can potentially reach a wide audience and have a tangible impact on reducing the ecological cost of using AI for creative purposes.

However, a potential drawback could be the effectiveness of such features in actually changing user behavior. While providing information and incentives is valuable, there is no guarantee that all users will actively engage with these prompts or be motivated to alter their image generation practices. Additionally, the success of this initiative may depend on the willingness of tech companies to cooperate and implement these changes, which could pose a challenge if they prioritize user engagement and revenue over environmental concerns.

Overall, the proposed solution is a step in the right direction towards addressing the environmental impact of AI image generation, but it may require further refinement and consideration of potential obstacles in implementation and user adoption.
