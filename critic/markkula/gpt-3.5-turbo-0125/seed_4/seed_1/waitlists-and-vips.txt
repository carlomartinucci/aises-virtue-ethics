Your response to the scenario is ethical and practical. You address the issue of fairness by rectifying the errors in data entry and creating a waiting list to allocate the extra tickets. By setting a deadline for responses and ensuring random selection, you prioritize inclusivity and give all seniors an equal chance to attend the event. This approach minimizes bias and maximizes the opportunity for more seniors to participate in the Senior Ball, which aligns with ethical principles of fairness and equity. Additionally, by communicating clearly with the senior class, you maintain transparency and uphold integrity in the ticket distribution process.

Overall, your proposed solution effectively navigates the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. It balances the needs of the senior class as a whole while also considering Callie's responsibilities and time constraints. By taking decisive action to address the issue and promote fairness, you demonstrate a commitment to ethical decision-making in a challenging situation. Great job!
