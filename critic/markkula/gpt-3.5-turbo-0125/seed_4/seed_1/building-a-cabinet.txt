The answer provided is quite good as it outlines a clear and logical process for Marcus to follow in making his decision. By evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of all candidates, considering their qualifications and potential contributions, and prioritizing the overall goals of the organization, Marcus can make an informed choice. The suggestion to create a balanced team by selecting someone who complements the existing members is also a practical approach to ensure the effectiveness of the executive cabinet.

One area for improvement could be to emphasize the importance of addressing potential resentments and fostering unity more proactively. Marcus should not only communicate openly with all candidates but also take concrete steps to mitigate any negative feelings that may arise from his decision. Building trust and collaboration within the team is crucial for the success of the executive cabinet, and Marcus should strive to create a supportive and inclusive environment from the start.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for Marcus to navigate this challenging situation, but it could benefit from additional emphasis on addressing potential conflicts and promoting unity within the organization.
