While the answer mentions that some colleges and universities have stopped using such software, a clearer recommendation on when and how to phase out its use entirely could be beneficial.

Overall, the response offers practical steps to address the ethical concerns associated with proctoring software in online exams but could benefit from a more assertive stance on discontinuation and a broader perspective on advocating for ethical assessment practices in higher education.
