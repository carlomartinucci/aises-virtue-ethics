Your answer is well-structured and provides a clear course of action that prioritizes Peter's well-being. By emphasizing the importance of seeking specialized care from a psychiatrist and explaining the limitations of your own expertise, you are acting in Peter's best interest. Offering to assist him in finding a psychiatrist and providing ongoing support demonstrates your commitment to his care.

However, to improve your response, you could consider addressing Peter's reluctance more directly. Acknowledge his trust in you and the importance of your relationship while firmly reiterating the necessity of specialized care for his condition. You could also explore potential barriers to seeking help, such as stigma or fear, and work collaboratively with Peter to overcome them. Additionally, discussing the potential benefits of treatment with a psychiatrist in more detail could help Peter better understand the value of seeking additional support. Overall, your response is ethical and practical, but could benefit from a more empathetic and tailored approach to Peter's specific concerns.
