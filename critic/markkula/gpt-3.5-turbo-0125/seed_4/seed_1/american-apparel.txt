The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it emphasizes the importance of reviewing company policies, conducting an investigation, and taking appropriate disciplinary actions based on the findings. It also highlights the importance of communication with all stakeholders to address the situation transparently.

However, the answer could be improved by including more specific steps on how to conduct the investigation and what disciplinary actions might be appropriate based on the severity of the misconduct. Additionally, it could benefit from addressing the need for preventive measures to ensure such behavior does not occur in the future, such as implementing training programs or revising company policies.

Overall, the answer is a good starting point, but it could be strengthened by providing more detailed and actionable steps to address the situation effectively and prevent similar issues from arising in the future.
