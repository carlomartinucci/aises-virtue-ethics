This answer is quite thorough and provides actionable steps for Miguel to take in order to address the potential conflict of interest he is facing. By immediately disclosing his dual roles and seeking guidance from relevant parties, Miguel demonstrates a commitment to transparency and a willingness to address the issue head-on. The suggestion of recusing himself from decision-making and considering stepping back from his active role in the club are practical solutions to mitigate any perceived bias and maintain the integrity of both roles.

Overall, this response offers a strong and ethical approach to handling the situation. By proactively addressing the conflict of interest and seeking guidance, Miguel can navigate the complexities of his dual roles with integrity. The only potential area for improvement could be to provide more specific examples of how Miguel could support the club behind the scenes while temporarily stepping back from his active role. This would further enhance the practicality of the proposed solutions.
