Your response is fair and ethical. You have addressed the issue of fairness and inclusivity by rectifying the errors in data entry and creating a waiting list for the extra tickets. By setting a deadline for responses and ensuring random selection, you are promoting transparency and giving all seniors an equal chance to attend the event. This approach prioritizes the overall well-being of the senior class and upholds the integrity of the event. Additionally, your solution is practical and actionable, providing a clear course of action for Callie to follow in resolving the situation effectively. Well done!
