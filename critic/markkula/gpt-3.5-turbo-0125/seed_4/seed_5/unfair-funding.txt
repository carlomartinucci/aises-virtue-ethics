This response is specific and actionable, providing concrete steps for Claire to address the issue of potential bias in funding allocations. By suggesting a meeting with the funding committee, presenting data, encouraging open dialogue, implementing a rotation system, and establishing clear evaluation criteria, the answer offers practical solutions to promote fairness and transparency in decision-making.

One positive aspect of this response is the emphasis on open communication and collaboration within the committee. By involving all members in the discussion and decision-making process, Claire can foster a sense of accountability and shared responsibility for ensuring fair funding allocations.

However, one potential drawback is the lack of consideration for Garret's feelings and the potential impact on his reputation within the student government. While it is important to address bias and promote fairness, it is also essential to handle the situation delicately to avoid personal conflicts or damage to relationships within the committee.
