The answer provided is ethical as it suggests a course of action that prioritizes addressing the issue directly with John in a private and supportive manner. By doing so, Matt shows concern for John's well-being while also emphasizing the importance of upholding a professional image and following the rules as a representative of the student government.

On the positive side, the answer encourages open communication and offers support to John, acknowledging the complexities of the situation. It also recognizes the need to handle the matter internally before considering any further actions, which is a prudent approach to resolving conflicts within an organization.

However, a potential drawback is that the answer does not address the possibility that John may not respond positively to Matt's concerns or may continue engaging in behavior that reflects poorly on the organization. In such cases, Matt may need to consider involving other members of the student government or seeking guidance from a higher authority to address the issue effectively.

Overall, the answer provides a reasonable and ethical course of action for Matt to follow in addressing the situation with John, emphasizing the importance of professionalism and internal resolution while also leaving room for further steps if needed.
