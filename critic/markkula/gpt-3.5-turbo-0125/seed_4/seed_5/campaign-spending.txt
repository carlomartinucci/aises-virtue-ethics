The answer provided is ethical as it suggests that James should limit his campaign spending to level the playing field for Alix, who comes from an economically disadvantaged background. By reallocating funds to more equitable initiatives, James can demonstrate fairness and integrity in the election process.

The suggestion to invest in joint events or debates that showcase both candidates' strengths is a practical and actionable solution that promotes fairness and allows for a more merit-based competition. It encourages James to focus on the quality of his campaign rather than relying on financial advantages.

However, the answer could be further improved by providing specific examples of how James can reallocate funds effectively, such as investing in online advertising or grassroots outreach efforts. Additionally, it could mention the importance of engaging with the student body on important issues rather than relying solely on extravagant campaign tactics.

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for ethical decision-making in the given scenario, but could benefit from more specific and actionable suggestions for James to follow through on.
