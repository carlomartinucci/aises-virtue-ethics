Your response provides practical and actionable advice to address Saumya's dilemma. You correctly emphasize the importance of valuing the efforts of students who applied for the positions and demonstrating commitment. Your suggestion to provide additional support or training to selected candidates to help them fulfill their roles is also a good approach to address any gaps in expertise.

However, you could have provided more specific recommendations on how Saumya could support the selected candidates, such as offering mentorship programs, organizing workshops, or connecting them with resources to enhance their knowledge in specific areas related to the committees they are assigned to. Overall, your response is ethical, practical, and offers a balanced solution to the situation. Good job!
