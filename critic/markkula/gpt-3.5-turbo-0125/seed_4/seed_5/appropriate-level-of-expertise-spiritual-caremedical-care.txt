The answer provided is a good starting point in addressing the situation with John. It correctly emphasizes the importance of seeking professional help for John's depression and potential relapse into alcoholism. The suggestion to accompany him to an appointment with a therapist or counselor is a proactive step in ensuring he receives the necessary support. Encouraging him to join a support group tailored to his challenges is a practical recommendation that could provide him with additional resources.

However, the response could be strengthened by addressing the immediate risk of alcohol relapse more directly. In addition to suggesting professional help, it would be beneficial to discuss the potential dangers of using alcohol as a coping mechanism, especially given John's history of alcoholism. Exploring alternative coping strategies or interventions specific to managing stress and anxiety without resorting to alcohol could be a valuable addition to the approach.

Overall, the answer is ethical in its concern for John's well-being and the proactive steps suggested to support him. By incorporating a more direct discussion on the risks associated with alcohol use and providing additional coping strategies, the response could be even more effective in addressing John's complex situation.
