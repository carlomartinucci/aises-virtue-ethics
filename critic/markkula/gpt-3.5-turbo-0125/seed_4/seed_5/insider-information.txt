The answer provided is ethical as it promotes impartiality and fairness in the funding process. By declining to meet with Alex personally and instead offering general guidance, Drake is taking a principled stand to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. This approach ensures that all student clubs and societies have an equal opportunity to access funding without any preferential treatment.

One positive aspect of this response is the clear communication of the importance of following established procedures to maintain fairness. By emphasizing the need for equal opportunities for all student organizations, Drake is upholding the integrity of the funding process and demonstrating a commitment to ethical conduct.

However, one area for improvement could be to offer additional support to Alex in a way that does not compromise fairness. Drake could suggest that Alex seek advice from other resources such as student advisors or peer mentors who can provide personalized guidance without creating a conflict of interest. This would show a willingness to help while still upholding ethical standards.

Overall, the response demonstrates a strong ethical stance by prioritizing fairness and impartiality in the funding process. By providing clear guidance and alternatives to personal review, Drake can navigate the situation ethically while still supporting student organizations.
