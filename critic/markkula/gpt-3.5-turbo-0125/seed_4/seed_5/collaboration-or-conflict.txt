The answer provided is practical and actionable, offering specific steps for Josh to take in order to address the issue with Alanna and work towards a resolution. It emphasizes the importance of open communication, expressing appreciation for the collaboration, and proposing a clear plan of action. The suggestion to involve a neutral mediator if necessary is a good way to potentially overcome the current impasse.

However, there is a lack of consideration for the potential consequences of involving a third party, such as how it may impact the autonomy and dynamics of the student government and RHA. Additionally, the answer could benefit from addressing the long-term implications of the decision, such as the impact on future collaborations between the two organizations.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for Josh to address the current situation, but could be enhanced by further exploring the potential outcomes and consequences of the suggested actions.
