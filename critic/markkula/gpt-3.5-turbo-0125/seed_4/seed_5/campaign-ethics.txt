The answer provided is mostly ethical, as it emphasizes seeking guidance, adhering to university guidelines, and prioritizing transparency and integrity. Seeking advice from a mentor or advisor and consulting the university's code of conduct are positive steps to take in navigating this ethical dilemma. Additionally, considering adjustments to ensure fairness and transparency demonstrates a willingness to address any potential ethical concerns.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting specific actions that Olivia could take to mitigate the ethical gray area. For example, proposing concrete steps such as disclosing her campaign intentions to the ASI executive team, making the election timeline public earlier, or restructuring the timing of events to avoid a conflict of interest would provide a clearer roadmap for Olivia to follow. By offering more actionable solutions, the answer could enhance its practicality and effectiveness in addressing the ethical implications of Olivia's situation.
