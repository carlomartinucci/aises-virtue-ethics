The answer provided is specific and actionable, which is commendable. By suggesting a meeting with the staff at the sexual assault prevention center to address the issue of vague information and proposing the creation of new, more concrete materials, the response demonstrates a proactive approach to improving the situation. The idea of incorporating visual aids and step-by-step guides to enhance understanding and inclusivity is a positive step towards making the resources more accessible to neurodiverse individuals.

However, the answer could be further improved by emphasizing the urgency of the situation and the importance of immediate action. It would be beneficial to stress the need for a prompt revision of the materials to ensure that neurodiverse students are not left vulnerable to potential harm due to unclear information on consent. Additionally, offering specific suggestions on how to make the materials more universally applicable, such as consulting with experts in neurodiversity or conducting focus groups with neurodiverse students for feedback, would enhance the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the issue at hand, but could benefit from a stronger sense of urgency and more detailed strategies for ensuring the revised materials are truly inclusive and accessible to all students.
