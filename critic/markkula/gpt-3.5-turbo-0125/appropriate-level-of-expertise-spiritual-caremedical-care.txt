Your answer is specific and actionable, which is good. You correctly identified the need for John to seek professional help and offered practical steps to support him in doing so. Your suggestion to reach out to other church members for additional assistance is also a positive step. However, you could have been more direct in addressing the potential risks of John's situation, such as the danger of relapse and the urgency of seeking help. Additionally, you could have emphasized the importance of setting boundaries in your role as a pastor and not attempting to provide professional counseling beyond your expertise. Overall, your response is practical and provides a good starting point for helping John, but could benefit from more assertiveness in addressing the seriousness of the situation.
