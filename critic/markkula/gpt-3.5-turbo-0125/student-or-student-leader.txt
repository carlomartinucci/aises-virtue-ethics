The answer provided is ethical as it seeks to find a solution that balances the senators' academic commitments with their responsibilities in student government. The approach of meeting with the senators individually to understand their situations and explore potential solutions is commendable. Offering assistance in communicating with academic advisors and proposing the idea of finding a proxy to attend meetings on behalf of the junior senator shows a proactive and empathetic approach.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific details on how the proxy selection process would work and ensuring that the proxy is adequately briefed to represent the concerns of the constituents effectively. Additionally, the proposal to adjust the attendance policy should include concrete steps on how this adjustment would be implemented and communicated to the rest of the Senate to ensure transparency and fairness.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a thoughtful and considerate approach to resolving the conflict, but could benefit from more detailed planning and communication strategies to ensure the proposed solutions are effectively implemented.
