The answer provided is specific and actionable, offering a practical solution to the scenario presented. Scheduling a face-to-face meeting with Alanna to address the issues directly is a proactive step towards resolving the conflict. The emphasis on expressing the importance of the event, listening to Alanna's perspective, and proposing a clear plan of action demonstrates a thoughtful approach to communication and problem-solving. Involving advisors to mediate the discussion is a strategic move to facilitate a productive resolution and salvage the partnership.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the potential risks and challenges that may arise during the meeting with Alanna. It would be beneficial to consider alternative solutions in case the direct approach does not yield the desired outcome. Additionally, a contingency plan for the event should be outlined in case the collaboration with RHA cannot be salvaged.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the situation, but could benefit from a more comprehensive evaluation of potential obstacles and alternative strategies to ensure the success of the event and the preservation of the partnership between student government and RHA.
