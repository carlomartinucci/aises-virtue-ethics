Your answer is ethical as it recommends Angela to recuse herself from voting to avoid any potential conflict of interest. By promoting fairness and impartiality in the decision-making process, you are emphasizing the importance of ethical conduct in such situations. Furthermore, suggesting that Angela communicate her decision to the rest of the student senate is a good way to uphold transparency and integrity.

To improve your response, you could provide more specific guidance on how Angela can handle the situation after recusing herself. For example, you could recommend that she work with another senator to ensure the vote is rescheduled promptly to minimize any inconvenience caused by the delay. Additionally, offering advice on how Angela can support the affected organizations during the delay would enhance the practicality of your answer.
