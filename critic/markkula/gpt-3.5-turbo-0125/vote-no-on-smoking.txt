The answer provided is specific and actionable, offering a practical approach for Talia to navigate the situation. By suggesting a meeting with the university administration to understand their concerns and seeking legal advice to assess potential legal implications, the response encourages Talia to gather more information before making a decision. This approach demonstrates a willingness to engage with all stakeholders involved and make an informed choice that balances the interests of both the student body and the university.

However, the answer could be improved by also recommending that Talia communicate openly with her constituency about the university administration's concerns. By involving the students in the decision-making process and explaining the complexities of the situation, Talia can demonstrate transparency and potentially garner support for her decision, even if it goes against their initial wishes. Additionally, the response could have emphasized the importance of weighing the potential consequences of the decision on both the student body and the university, highlighting the need for a thoughtful and ethical approach to governance.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the scenario, but could benefit from further emphasis on communication with the student body and consideration of the broader implications of the decision.
