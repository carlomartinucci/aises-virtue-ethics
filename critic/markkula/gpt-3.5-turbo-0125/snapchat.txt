The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it advocates for a thorough investigation into the situation, considering all relevant information and potential legal implications. It emphasizes transparency and upholding the company's values and reputation, which are important aspects of ethical decision-making.

However, the answer could be improved by being more specific in outlining the steps that the board of directors should take during the investigation. For example, it could suggest involving an independent third party to ensure impartiality, setting a timeline for the investigation, and detailing the process for communicating the findings to stakeholders. Additionally, the answer could address the potential impact on employees, users, and investors, and propose strategies for mitigating any negative consequences.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the situation ethically, but could benefit from more specific and actionable recommendations to enhance its effectiveness.
