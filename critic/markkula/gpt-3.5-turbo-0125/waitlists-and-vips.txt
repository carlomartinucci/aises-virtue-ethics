The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes fairness and transparency in the distribution of the remaining tickets. By rectifying the errors in data entry and offering the tickets on a first-come, first-served basis to the senior class, the answer ensures that all students have an equal opportunity to attend the event. This approach also acknowledges the importance of upholding integrity and avoiding favoritism towards friends.

However, the answer could be improved by considering alternative solutions that could potentially accommodate more students who missed out on purchasing tickets. While the first-come, first-served approach is efficient, Callie could explore options such as organizing a lottery system or extending the event to accommodate a few more attendees within the venue's capacity limits. These additional considerations would further enhance the fairness and inclusivity of the ticket distribution process.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable solution to the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario, emphasizing the importance of equitable treatment for all students involved.
