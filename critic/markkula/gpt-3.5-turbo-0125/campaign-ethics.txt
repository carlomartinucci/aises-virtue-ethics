The answer provided is a good starting point for Olivia's situation. It emphasizes seeking guidance from a mentor or advisor, being transparent with colleagues, and evaluating the timeline of events to ensure fairness. These actions demonstrate a commitment to ethical considerations and integrity.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific steps Olivia could take to address the ethical concerns. For example, suggesting that Olivia document her decision-making process and rationale for the timing of events, or exploring alternative ways to showcase her accomplishments without potentially benefiting her campaign unfairly, would add practicality to the answer.

Overall, the answer is on the right track but could benefit from more actionable and specific recommendations to enhance Olivia's ethical decision-making process in this scenario.
