The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes fairness and impartiality in the funding process. By declining Alex's request for personalized guidance and encouraging the use of available resources, Drake ensures equal access to support for all student organizations. This approach maintains integrity and avoids the appearance of favoritism, which is crucial in a position of authority like Finance Commissioner.

To improve the response, it could be more actionable by suggesting specific ways Drake can support Alex without compromising fairness. For example, Drake could offer to hold a general workshop or Q&A session for all student organizations to address common questions and provide guidance in a group setting. This would demonstrate a commitment to helping all groups while upholding ethical standards.

Overall, the answer provides a clear course of action that aligns with ethical principles, but could benefit from more specific suggestions on how Drake can support Alex and other student organizations in a fair and transparent manner.
