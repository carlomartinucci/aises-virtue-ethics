Your response is specific, practical, and actionable, which is commendable. You provide clear steps for Jessica to prioritize Adam's safety while still maintaining the credibility of the article. Your advice to explain the risks to Adam, respect his decision to remain anonymous, and find alternative ways to corroborate his story is sound and ethical.

One area for improvement could be to suggest specific ways for Jessica to ensure the credibility of Adam's story without compromising his safety. For example, recommending that she seek input from other undocumented students or immigration advocates who can vouch for the authenticity of his experiences is a good start, but providing more concrete strategies or resources for verification would enhance the practicality of your advice.

Overall, your response effectively addresses the ethical dilemma at hand and offers actionable steps for Jessica to navigate the situation with integrity and sensitivity. Well done!
