Additionally, he should be prepared to handle potential pushback or resistance from his supervisor or higher-ups in the company.

Furthermore, Tre should be mindful of the sensitive nature of the situation, especially considering the possibility of layoffs and his status as a new employee. It would be wise for him to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, while still firmly advocating for ethical practices.

Overall, Tre's decision to address the issue directly with his supervisor is a positive step towards promoting honesty and integrity in the workplace. By taking a proactive stance and seeking clarification on the matter, Tre can contribute to a culture of transparency and accountability within the company.
