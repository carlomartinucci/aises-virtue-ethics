Your answer to advise Angela to disclose her conflict of interest to the rest of the student senate is a good step in the right direction. Being transparent and upfront about her personal connection to Emily and the Hawaiian cultural club is essential in maintaining integrity in decision-making processes. By doing so, Angela allows her colleagues to be aware of the potential bias and can take that into account when making their own decisions.

However, your advice lacks a specific plan of action on how the senate should proceed after the disclosure. It would have been more actionable if you had suggested potential solutions such as having a neutral party oversee the funding allocation process or proposing a compromise that benefits all student organizations involved. Providing clear steps for moving forward after the disclosure would have made your answer more practical and effective in addressing the ethical dilemma at hand.
