The answer provided is ethical as it suggests that Miguel prioritize his role on the student government and step down from the executive position in the outdoor club to avoid conflicts of interest. By communicating openly and honestly with the club members, Miguel shows accountability and transparency in his decision-making process. Offering support in other capacities also demonstrates a commitment to the club's success despite stepping down.

On the positive side, the answer emphasizes the importance of upholding ethical standards and maintaining neutrality in roles that may present a conflict of interest. It provides a practical solution by suggesting concrete actions for Miguel to take, such as stepping down and offering support in other ways.

One improvement could be to suggest that Miguel work with the club to establish clear boundaries and protocols to prevent conflicts of interest in the future, should he decide to rejoin after his term in the student government. This proactive approach could help mitigate potential conflicts and ensure a smoother transition back into the club after his absence.

Overall, the answer provides a clear, actionable solution to the dilemma Miguel faces, highlighting the importance of ethical behavior and professional integrity in navigating dual roles within the student organization.
