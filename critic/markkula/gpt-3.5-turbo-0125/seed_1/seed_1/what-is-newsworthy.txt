The suggested course of action for Fatimah to discuss her concerns with her editor or supervisor at the newspaper is a practical and actionable step in addressing the ethical dilemma presented. By expressing her reservations and discussing the potential impact on individuals involved, she is engaging in a constructive dialogue that could lead to a more thoughtful approach to sharing campus safety reports on social media.

This approach acknowledges the importance of ethical considerations in journalism and promotes a discussion on the newsworthiness and impact of the content being shared. It also recognizes the potential consequences of sensationalizing safety incidents for the sake of increasing readership.

However, the evaluation could be improved by providing more specific examples of potential ethical implications and highlighting the need for a clear editorial policy on sharing campus safety reports. Additionally, suggesting that Fatimah propose alternative ways to engage the student body on digital platforms without compromising ethical standards would enhance the practicality of the response.
