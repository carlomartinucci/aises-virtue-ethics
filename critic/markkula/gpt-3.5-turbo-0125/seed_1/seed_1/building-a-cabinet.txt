The answer provided is specific and actionable, offering a clear step-by-step approach for Marcus to follow in making his decision. By suggesting individual meetings with both the opposing candidates and campaign supporters, the answer emphasizes the importance of assessing motivation, skills, and alignment with Marcus's vision. Additionally, considering the overall balance of experience, seeking feedback from key stakeholders, and prioritizing the organization's best interests showcase a thoughtful and thorough decision-making process.
