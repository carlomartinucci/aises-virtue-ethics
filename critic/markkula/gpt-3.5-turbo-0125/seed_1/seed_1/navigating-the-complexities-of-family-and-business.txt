The answer provides practical steps for Mary to take in addressing the situation with her brother Donald and the future of the family business, which is commendable. Recommending open communication, proposing compromise solutions, highlighting financial implications, and emphasizing the importance of family harmony are all constructive approaches to resolving the conflict.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific strategies for how Mary can navigate the conversation with Donald effectively. For instance, suggesting specific ways to present the financial impact of selling the building, outlining potential alternatives to selling, and offering concrete steps for maintaining family relationships during this challenging time would enhance the answer's practicality.

In conclusion, while the answer offers sound advice on how Mary should proceed ethically in this complex situation, it would benefit from more detailed and actionable guidance to help Mary effectively address the conflicting viewpoints within her family and make a well-informed decision that balances financial considerations and familial relationships.
