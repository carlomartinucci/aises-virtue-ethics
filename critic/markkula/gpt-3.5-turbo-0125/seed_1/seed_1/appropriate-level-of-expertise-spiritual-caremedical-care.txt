The answer provided is ethical and takes appropriate steps to address the situation with John. It acknowledges the seriousness of the issues at hand, such as potential depression and relapse into alcoholism, and emphasizes the importance of seeking professional help. By expressing genuine concern, offering support, and providing resources, the response demonstrates a caring and responsible approach to helping John navigate his challenges.

However, the answer could be improved by being more specific in outlining the steps to connect John with professional help. For instance, the response could suggest making a list of counselors or therapists for John to consider, offering to accompany him to an appointment, or reaching out to local support groups on his behalf. Providing concrete actions would enhance the practicality of the response and make it more actionable for both John and the pastor.

Overall, the answer is well-intentioned and ethical, but it could benefit from more specific guidance on how to facilitate John's access to professional help in a tangible way.
