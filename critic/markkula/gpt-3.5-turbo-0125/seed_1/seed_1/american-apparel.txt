The answer provided addresses the situation at American Apparel involving Dov Charney by proposing concrete actions to review and enhance the company's code of conduct, investigate past incidents, implement strict policies, and monitor compliance. It also suggests working closely with the new board and management team to ensure a safe and respectful work environment, as well as reviewing marketing strategies to align with ethical practices. These actions demonstrate a proactive approach to addressing the ethical issues within the company and striving for positive change.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific details on how the investigation would be conducted, what specific policies would be implemented, and how training sessions on appropriate workplace behavior would be structured. Additionally, there could be more emphasis on holding individuals, including top management, accountable for their actions and ensuring transparency in decision-making processes.
