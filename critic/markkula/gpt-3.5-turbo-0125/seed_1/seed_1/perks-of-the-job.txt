Your proposed course of action is commendable in its emphasis on addressing the issue directly and attempting to find a collaborative solution. By scheduling a meeting with Julia and discussing the matter privately, you show respect for her and the organization's policies. Your approach of calmly explaining the importance of following the rules and highlighting the potential consequences of her actions is a good way to raise awareness.

Additionally, suggesting alternative solutions to reduce costs and offering assistance in implementing them demonstrates a proactive and constructive attitude towards problem-solving. By aiming to find a resolution that balances both the organization's values and the working relationship with Julia, you show a thoughtful consideration of the various stakeholders involved.

However, it would be beneficial to also address the potential conflict of interest in Julia's justification for her actions. Bringing up the ethical implications of using organizational resources for personal benefit, even in exchange for time contributed, could provide a more comprehensive perspective on the issue.

Overall, your response is practical and actionable, focusing on communication, collaboration, and problem-solving. It effectively balances the need to address the misconduct while maintaining professionalism and respect.
