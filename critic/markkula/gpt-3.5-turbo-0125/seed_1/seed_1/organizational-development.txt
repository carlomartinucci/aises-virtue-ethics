The answer provided is practical and actionable, offering specific steps for Carlos to take in addressing the dilemma. By suggesting alternative funding options such as seeking sponsors or conducting fundraising initiatives, the response shows a proactive approach to solving the financial challenge. Additionally, the recommendation to communicate transparently with the student body about the decision demonstrates a commitment to honesty and accountability.

On the positive side, the answer encourages Carlos to explore creative solutions and maintain open communication, which are essential aspects of ethical decision-making. By involving others in the decision-making process and being transparent about the reasoning behind the choice, Carlos can build trust and understanding within the student government organization.

However, one area for improvement could be to further emphasize the importance of considering the potential impact on the student body when making decisions about budget allocation. While the focus is on justifying the retreat's significance for student government members, it would be beneficial to also address how the retreat ultimately contributes to better serving the broader student community.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for addressing the ethical dilemma faced by Carlos, with room for enhancement in highlighting the connection between the retreat and the organization's ability to positively impact the student body as a whole.
