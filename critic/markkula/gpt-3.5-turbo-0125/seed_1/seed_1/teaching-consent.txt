However, the response could benefit from more specific details on how the collaboration with the sexual assault prevention center would be initiated and sustained. It would be helpful to outline a clear timeline for the workshop development, as well as a plan for ongoing support and evaluation of its effectiveness. Additionally, addressing potential challenges or barriers that may arise during the implementation of the workshop could further strengthen the response.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the issue of consent education for neurodiverse students.
