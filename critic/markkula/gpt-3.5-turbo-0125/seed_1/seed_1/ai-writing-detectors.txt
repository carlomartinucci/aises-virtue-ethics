The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of reviewing research findings, collaborating with stakeholders, and exploring alternative strategies to address the issue of AI-generated text in student assignments. By considering the impact on student engagement and motivation, the answer demonstrates a commitment to fairness and student welfare. 

Positively, the answer suggests a proactive approach to understanding the limitations of AI detection tools and seeking input from relevant parties. It also encourages the promotion of academic integrity through education and fostering a culture of originality, which can have long-term positive effects on student learning outcomes.

However, the answer could be further improved by offering more specific actions, such as conducting pilot studies to test the accuracy of Turnitin's AI detection feature in diverse contexts, developing guidelines for interpreting results from AI tools, and implementing additional support mechanisms for students flagged by the system. By providing actionable steps, the response could enhance its practicality and effectiveness in addressing the ethical concerns surrounding AI detection tools in academia.
