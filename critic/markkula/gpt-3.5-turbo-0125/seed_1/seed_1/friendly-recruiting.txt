The answer provided is mostly ethical in addressing the situation. It emphasizes reviewing the applications of the remaining candidates first, offering support and guidance to help them succeed, and encouraging Saumya's friends to apply through the regular process. These actions show a consideration for fairness and giving all candidates a chance.

However, the answer could be improved by including a specific plan on how to address the mismatch between the remaining candidates and the committee preferences. It would be beneficial to outline concrete steps on how to provide training or resources to help the candidates develop the necessary skills for their roles.

Additionally, the answer could further enhance its ethical standing by ensuring transparency throughout the process. Saumya should communicate openly with both the candidates and her friends about the selection process, the criteria being considered, and the importance of fairness and equal opportunity for all applicants.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a balanced approach to the dilemma, focusing on maximizing the quality of student representation while also considering the growth and development opportunities for all candidates involved. With some additional specificity and transparency, this response could be even more effective in handling the situation ethically.
