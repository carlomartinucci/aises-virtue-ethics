The answer provided is specific and practical in addressing the ethical considerations at play in the scenario. It recommends that Andres carefully weighs the potential consequences of publishing the student's name, considering the impact on his safety and well-being, as well as the credibility of the newspaper. The suggestion to consult with an editor or senior staff member for guidance is a proactive step to ensure ethical standards are upheld.
