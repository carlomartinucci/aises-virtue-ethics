The answer provided is a practical and specific course of action for Matt to take in this scenario. By privately messaging John, Matt can address his concerns about the unprofessional behavior without risking his own reputation or relationship within the organization. The suggestion to discuss the situation further in person shows a willingness to handle the issue maturely and responsibly.

However, there are potential downsides to this approach. By confronting John privately, Matt may not be able to ensure that the issue is appropriately addressed within the organization. There is a risk that John may not take the feedback seriously or may even react negatively to being called out. Additionally, if John does not take down the video or make changes, Matt may be left with the decision of whether to escalate the situation further.

In conclusion, while the suggested course of action is a good starting point for Matt to address the situation, he should also be prepared to take additional steps if necessary to uphold the professionalism and reputation of the student government. It would be beneficial for Matt to have a plan in place for how to proceed if John does not respond positively to his message.
