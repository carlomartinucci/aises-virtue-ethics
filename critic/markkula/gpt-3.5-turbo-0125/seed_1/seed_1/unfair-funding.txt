The suggested actions are practical and actionable. Implementing a blind review process for funding requests would indeed help mitigate bias and ensure that decisions are made based on merit rather than personal relationships. Establishing clear evaluation criteria is also a good step to standardize the process and promote fairness. These actions address the issue of unequal funding distribution and aim to create a more equitable system.

However, it would be beneficial to also consider involving a third-party oversight mechanism to ensure the integrity of the blind review process and evaluation criteria. This additional layer of accountability could further strengthen the fairness of the funding distribution system and provide assurance to all involved parties.

Overall, the answer provides specific steps for Claire to take to address the issue at hand effectively. By incorporating third-party oversight, the proposed actions could be even more robust and ensure transparency and fairness in the decision-making process.
