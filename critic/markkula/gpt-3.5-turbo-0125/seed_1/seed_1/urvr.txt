The answer provided is fairly ethical in addressing the scenario. By ensuring that all employees are trained on data handling and privacy protection measures, conducting regular audits, and implementing strong encryption measures, the response shows a proactive approach to safeguarding user privacy. This demonstrates a commitment to upholding the company's promise of deleting data within the specified time frame and protecting user information.

However, the answer could be improved by including specific details on how the encryption measures would be implemented and what specific training modules would be included for employees. Providing concrete steps and examples would enhance the actionable nature of the response.

Overall, the answer showcases a good understanding of the importance of data privacy and protection in the context of the VR file-sharing app scenario. It could be further enhanced by adding more specific details to make the plan more robust and effective in practice.
