The answer provided is ethical as it addresses the serious issue of child labor in IKEA's supply chain and outlines specific actions to tackle the problem. 

Positive aspects of the answer include the immediate review of supplier contracts, implementation of strict inspection policies, development of training programs, collaboration with authorities and NGOs, and transparent communication with stakeholders. These actions demonstrate a commitment to addressing the root causes of child labor and working towards sustainable solutions.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of detail on how IKEA plans to enforce these actions and hold suppliers accountable. It would be beneficial to include specific measures for monitoring compliance, implementing consequences for violations, and ensuring continuous improvement in supply chain practices.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the issue of child labor in a proactive and responsible manner. By incorporating more specific strategies for enforcement and accountability, IKEA can enhance the effectiveness of its efforts to eradicate child labor from its supply chain.
