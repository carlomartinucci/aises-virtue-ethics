The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on advocating for the affected Michigan residents and working towards systemic reforms to prevent similar injustices in the future. By collaborating with legal aid organizations to provide pro bono legal assistance, helping residents navigate legal processes, and engaging with policymakers for increased transparency and accountability, the response addresses the immediate needs of the impacted individuals and aims to create long-term positive change.

The proactive approach of offering legal assistance and advocating for policy reforms demonstrates a commitment to seeking justice and accountability for those affected by the flawed automated system. By working with legal aid organizations and policymakers, the answer shows a practical and actionable way to support the impacted residents and address the root causes of the issue.

However, the answer could be further improved by specifying concrete steps to engage with policymakers and advocacy groups, such as drafting specific policy recommendations or organizing advocacy campaigns. Additionally, ensuring ongoing support for the affected residents beyond legal assistance, such as providing resources for financial counseling or mental health support, would enhance the overall impact of the proposed actions.
