The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes maintaining neutrality and avoiding conflicts of interest in Miguel's dual roles. By stepping down from the executive position in the outdoor club, Miguel demonstrates a commitment to upholding ethical standards and ensuring fairness in the decision-making process within the student government. Communicating openly with the club members about his decision and offering continued support in other capacities shows respect for the club's goals and the importance of ethical conduct.

However, one potential downside of this approach is that Miguel may miss out on the exciting time of growth and development within the outdoor club. To address this, Miguel could explore ways to stay involved with the club in a non-leadership capacity, such as participating in trips or events as a regular member. This would allow him to continue supporting the club's mission while avoiding conflicts of interest in his role on student government.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable solution to the ethical dilemma faced by Miguel, emphasizing the importance of transparency, communication, and ethical decision-making in navigating his dual roles.
