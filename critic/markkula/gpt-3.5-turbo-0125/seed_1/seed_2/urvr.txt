The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on safeguarding user privacy and data protection. The proactive approach of training employees, conducting regular audits, and implementing encryption measures demonstrates a commitment to upholding the company's promise of prioritizing user privacy. This approach not only aligns with the company's stated values but also ensures compliance with data protection regulations.

However, to further improve the answer, it could have included specific details on how to handle situations where employees fail to follow the data deletion process or how to address potential security breaches. Additionally, implementing measures to inform users about their privacy rights and providing them with tools to control their data would enhance transparency and trust.
