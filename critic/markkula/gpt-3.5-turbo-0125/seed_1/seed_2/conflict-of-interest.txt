The answer provided is practical and specific in advising Miguel to prioritize his role in student government and step down from the executive position in the outdoor club to avoid conflicts of interest. This solution demonstrates a clear understanding of the ethical dilemma Miguel faces and offers a concrete course of action to address it. By communicating openly with the club members and offering continued support in other capacities, Miguel can maintain his integrity and uphold ethical standards in both roles.

However, a potential downside of this approach is that Miguel may miss out on the exciting growth of the club during his absence. To mitigate this, Miguel could consider delegating specific responsibilities to trusted club members or creating a clear plan for his return to the club after his term on student government ends. This would allow him to maintain a connection with the club and its members while still prioritizing his ethical obligations.

Overall, the answer provides a practical solution to the ethical dilemma Miguel faces, with clear steps for implementation and potential areas for improvement to ensure a smooth transition and continued support for the club.
