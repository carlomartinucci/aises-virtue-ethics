The answer provided offers practical and actionable steps for Carlos to consider in addressing the dilemma. It suggests exploring alternative funding options, such as seeking sponsors or engaging in fundraising activities, which is a proactive approach to mitigating the financial strain on the student government budget. Additionally, the recommendation to communicate transparently with the student body about the decision demonstrates a commitment to maintaining trust and accountability within the organization.

However, the answer could be improved by delving deeper into the potential consequences of reallocating funds from the greater student government budget. It would be beneficial to consider potential alternatives to reduce costs or maximize resources before resorting to this option. Additionally, a more thorough evaluation of the long-term benefits of the retreat on both student government members and the student body as a whole would provide a stronger justification for the decision.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma faced by Carlos, but could benefit from a more comprehensive analysis of the potential impacts and considerations involved in making this decision.
