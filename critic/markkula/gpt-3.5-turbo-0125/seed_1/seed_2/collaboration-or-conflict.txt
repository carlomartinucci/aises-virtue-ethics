The answer provided suggests a practical and actionable course of action for Josh in this scenario. By arranging a face-to-face meeting with Alanna to address the concerns and issues, Josh shows a willingness to communicate openly and seek understanding. The proposal of a clear plan of action and involving a neutral third-party mediator if needed demonstrates a proactive approach to resolving the situation.

However, the answer could benefit from additional specificity in terms of outlining specific steps to address Alanna's concerns or potential barriers to collaboration. It would also be helpful to include a contingency plan in case Alanna remains uncooperative even after the proposed actions are taken.

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for resolving the conflict between student government and RHA, but could be strengthened by incorporating more detailed strategies for effective communication and problem-solving.
