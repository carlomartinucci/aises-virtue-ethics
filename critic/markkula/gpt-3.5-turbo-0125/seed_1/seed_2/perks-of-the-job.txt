The answer provided is practical and actionable. It acknowledges the complexity of the situation, considering both Julia's contributions to the organization and the ethical issue at hand. The approach of scheduling a private meeting with Julia to address the misuse of office resources is appropriate and shows a willingness to address the issue directly. By emphasizing the importance of adhering to organizational policies, expressing concerns about the budget impact, and offering assistance in finding alternative solutions, the answer demonstrates a thoughtful and diplomatic approach to resolving the issue.

However, one potential improvement could be to address the issue of Julia justifying her actions by stating she deserves perks due to her time commitment. It would be beneficial to discuss how such reasoning may not align with the values of the organization and how all members should uphold ethical standards regardless of their level of involvement.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for addressing the ethical dilemma while maintaining professionalism and respect for all parties involved.
