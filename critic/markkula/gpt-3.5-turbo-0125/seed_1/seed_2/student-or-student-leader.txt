The answer provided is a practical and actionable approach to reconciling the problem faced by the student government's Senate. 

The positive aspects of the response include: 
1. Initiating individual discussions with the affected senators to understand their perspectives and explore potential solutions.
2. Involving the Senate as a whole to seek input and brainstorm possible alternatives.
3. Proposing a solution of designating alternate representatives to attend meetings on behalf of the absent senators to ensure constituents' concerns are still represented.
4. Considering adjusting the attendance policy for these specific circumstances to accommodate the unique constraints faced by the senators.

However, one area for improvement could be to address potential challenges that may arise from designating alternate representatives, such as ensuring effective communication between the absent senators and the designated representatives, and how decision-making processes will be handled in their absence. Additionally, it would be beneficial to consider the long-term implications of adjusting the attendance policy and how it may impact future situations.

Overall, the response demonstrates a thoughtful and proactive approach to finding a solution that balances the needs of the organization with the individual circumstances of the senators involved.
