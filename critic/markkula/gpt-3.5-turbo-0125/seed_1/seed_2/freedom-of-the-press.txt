The answer provided is ethical as it encourages Carrie to include the topic of the new statue and related jokes in her video, acknowledging the importance of transparency and authenticity in reflecting student conversations. By presenting different perspectives and framing the discussion constructively, Carrie can address the topic in a balanced manner. However, the response lacks specific guidance on how to mitigate potential negative impacts on donor relations and university resources. To improve, Carrie could explore ways to address the issue tactfully, possibly by emphasizing the university's efforts to engage with student feedback and showcasing positive aspects of the statue project alongside the criticisms. This would help maintain a respectful dialogue while still upholding the values of openness and honesty in representing student sentiments.
