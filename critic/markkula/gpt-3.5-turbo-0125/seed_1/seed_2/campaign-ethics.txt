The answer provided for Olivia's situation is ethical to a large extent. Seeking guidance from a mentor or advisor, conducting self-assessment, and being transparent with colleagues are all positive steps to address the ethical concerns raised in the scenario. These actions demonstrate a willingness to reflect on the situation, consider different perspectives, and potentially make adjustments for fairness and integrity.

However, the answer could be improved by delving deeper into the potential consequences of Olivia's actions. While seeking advice and feedback is commendable, the answer could have emphasized the importance of considering the impact on the overall democratic process within the university. It would have been beneficial to suggest Olivia explicitly evaluate whether her actions could give her an unfair advantage over potential competitors and how that might affect the credibility of the election process.

Overall, the answer offers practical steps for Olivia to navigate her ethical dilemma effectively, but could be strengthened by more explicit considerations of the wider implications of her actions on the election process and the perception of fairness among students and other ASI members.
