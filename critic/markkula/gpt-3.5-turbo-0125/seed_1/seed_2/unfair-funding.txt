The suggested course of action to implement a blind review process for funding requests and establish clear evaluation criteria is a practical and actionable solution to the ethical dilemma Claire faces. By removing identifying information from the proposals, the process becomes more fair and impartial, mitigating the potential bias that may arise from personal relationships or admiration for influential members like Garret. Additionally, setting clear guidelines for evaluating funding requests ensures consistency and transparency in decision-making, promoting fairness across all clubs.

However, the evaluation could be improved by providing more specific details on how to implement the blind review process and what specific criteria should be included in the evaluation guidelines. For example, details on the process of anonymizing proposals, ensuring confidentiality during the review, and defining specific evaluation metrics would enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the solution. Moreover, addressing potential challenges or resistance from committee members, such as Garret's personal feelings or concerns about limiting creativity, would further strengthen the practicality of the proposed actions. Overall, the response offers a solid foundation for addressing the ethical issue at hand but could benefit from more specificity and depth in implementation strategies.
