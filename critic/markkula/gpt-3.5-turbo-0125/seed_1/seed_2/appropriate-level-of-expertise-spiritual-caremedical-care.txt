The answer provided is ethical and practical. It acknowledges the seriousness of the situation and the potential risks John is facing. The response emphasizes the importance of seeking professional help from a qualified counselor or therapist, which is a crucial step in addressing John's mental health and substance abuse concerns effectively. Additionally, offering support, resources, and continuing to provide spiritual guidance shows care and concern for John's well-being holistically.

However, there is room for improvement in the response. It could be more specific in detailing the steps the pastor could take to assist John in finding a suitable professional, such as researching local counselors or therapists specializing in mental health and addiction issues and providing John with contact information or making an appointment on his behalf if needed. Furthermore, the response could suggest alternative support options in case John remains hesitant about seeking professional help, such as support groups or hotlines that could offer immediate assistance and guidance. Providing specific action steps and alternative solutions would enhance the practicality and effectiveness of the pastor's approach to supporting John in this challenging situation.
