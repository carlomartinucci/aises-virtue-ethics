The answer provided is ethical as it addresses the issue of workload distribution among the staff members and prioritizes the neglected state-level advocacy work that is crucial for the student body. The action of scheduling individual meetings with each staff member to assess their workload and stress levels shows consideration for their well-being and recognizes the importance of aligning tasks with their capabilities.

Moreover, the plan to reassess and potentially redistribute tasks to ensure a more balanced workload, as well as the commitment to taking a more active role in the neglected responsibilities, demonstrates a proactive approach to resolving the situation. By communicating openly with the staff about the need for balance and providing support in reallocating tasks, the answer aims to improve efficiency and effectiveness in fulfilling all aspects of the position.

Additionally, implementing regular check-ins or feedback sessions to monitor workload balance and address any emerging issues could help prevent future overload situations.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable solution to Bryson's dilemma, highlighting the importance of balancing responsibilities, supporting the well-being of the team, and ensuring all aspects of the role are adequately addressed.
