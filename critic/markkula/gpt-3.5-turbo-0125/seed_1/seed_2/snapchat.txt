You offer practical steps such as conducting an internal investigation, seeking external guidance, developing a communication plan, and considering disciplinary action.

Additionally, a more explicit mention of the importance of transparency, accountability, and cultural change within the organization would enhance the ethical dimension of your recommendations.

Overall, your response is practical and offers a structured approach for Snapchat to navigate the crisis effectively. To improve, consider incorporating a stronger ethical framework and highlighting the significance of addressing the underlying issues of misconduct and promoting a more inclusive workplace culture.
