The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being of the patient and recognizes the limitations of the physician's expertise. It appropriately emphasizes the importance of seeking a specialist's evaluation for a potential serious psychiatric disorder like bi-polar disorder. Encouraging the patient to reconsider seeing a psychiatrist and offering to assist in finding a mental health professional demonstrates a commitment to providing comprehensive care. Additionally, documenting discussions in the patient's medical records and monitoring symptoms closely are responsible actions to take in this situation.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific details on potential alternative options for support and care within the primary care physician's scope of practice. It would be beneficial to outline specific resources or strategies that could help manage the patient's symptoms while respecting his autonomy and preferences. Additionally, discussing potential consequences of untreated bi-polar disorder and involving Peter in developing a plan for his care could further enhance the response.
