The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of transparency, honesty, and open communication in dealing with Grace's situation. By advising Grace to have a candid conversation with senior members of the student government and potential constituents, the answer promotes ethical behavior by ensuring that all parties involved are informed and have the opportunity to provide input.

The suggestion to seek input from senior members on potential solutions and to communicate openly with constituents about her graduation plans demonstrates a practical approach to addressing the dilemma. By exploring alternatives such as finding a temporary replacement or identifying other ways to contribute post-graduation, Grace can work towards a resolution that minimizes disruption to the organization while still honoring her commitments.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how Grace can proactively address the potential impact of her early graduation on committee work and voting ratios. Offering concrete steps or strategies for mitigating these effects would enhance the actionable nature of the advice given.

Overall, the answer strikes a good balance between ethical considerations and practical solutions, but could benefit from additional specificity in addressing the operational challenges that may arise from Grace's situation.
