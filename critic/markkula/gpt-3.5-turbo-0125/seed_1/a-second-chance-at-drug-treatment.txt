The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing the complex situation with Jerome. Scheduling a meeting to discuss his situation in more detail shows a willingness to understand his circumstances better. Expressing concerns about his relapse and the need for more intensive treatment demonstrates a commitment to his well-being. Exploring alternative treatment options and resources also shows a proactive approach to finding the best solution for Jerome's recovery.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the ethical dilemma more directly. It would be beneficial to acknowledge the potential impact of racial discrimination on Jerome's access to treatment and consider how to address this issue within the constraints of the program's policies. Additionally, outlining a clear plan for monitoring Jerome's progress and setting specific goals for his treatment would enhance the actionable steps outlined in the response.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for supporting Jerome through his recovery journey, but could benefit from a more explicit consideration of the ethical implications and a more detailed plan for ongoing support and monitoring.
