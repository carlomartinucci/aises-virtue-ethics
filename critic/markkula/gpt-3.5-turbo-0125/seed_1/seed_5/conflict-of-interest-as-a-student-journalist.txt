The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes transparency, credibility, and balance in reporting. By advising Nadia to disclose her affiliations at the beginning of the article, readers are informed about any potential biases, allowing them to assess the objectivity of the piece. Encouraging her to remain diligent in seeking diverse perspectives and verifying information ensures a balanced view of the issue is presented. This approach maintains journalistic integrity and trust with the audience.

However, it would be beneficial to also suggest that Nadia actively seek out voices from different perspectives involved in the issue, including those who may not align with the views of the student organization. By ensuring a range of opinions are included in the article, she can further demonstrate fairness and impartiality in her reporting. Additionally, providing guidance on how to navigate potential conflicts of interest in future assignments would enhance the practicality of the advice given.
