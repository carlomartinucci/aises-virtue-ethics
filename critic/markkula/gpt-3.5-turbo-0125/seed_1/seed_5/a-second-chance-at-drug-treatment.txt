The answer provided is relatively ethical as it recognizes the complexity of Jerome's situation and the limitations of available resources. Scheduling a meeting to discuss his case in more detail shows a willingness to understand his specific needs and challenges. The consideration of providing another chance based on his motivation and commitment levels is commendable, as it takes into account individual circumstances rather than applying a blanket policy.

However, the response could benefit from more clarity on the specific support services that will be offered to Jerome beyond the outpatient program. It would be helpful to outline concrete steps and interventions that can be implemented to address his relapse and increase his chances of success. Additionally, a more explicit plan for monitoring and evaluating his progress over time would enhance the effectiveness of the intervention.

Overall, the answer is a good starting point, but it could be improved by providing more detailed and actionable steps to support Jerome in his recovery journey.
