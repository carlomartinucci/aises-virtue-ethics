The response provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of maintaining fairness and impartiality in the funding process by encouraging the use of available resources rather than providing personalized guidance. By doing so, Drake ensures that all student clubs have equal access to information and resources, which is commendable.

However, the response could be improved by suggesting additional steps Drake could take to support Alex while maintaining professional ethics. Drake could offer to answer specific questions via email or schedule a group session to provide general advice to all student clubs, ensuring fairness and equal access to guidance. This way, Drake can support Alex and other student organizations without compromising his professional ethics.

Overall, the response is practical and actionable, but it could be enhanced by providing more specific suggestions for supporting Alex and other student clubs within the boundaries of professional ethics.
