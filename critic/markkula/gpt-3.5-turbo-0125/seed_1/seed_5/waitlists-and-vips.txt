By rectifying the errors in data entry and creating a fair and efficient process for distributing the remaining tickets, you address the issue of fairness and integrity in the ticket distribution process. Additionally, your suggestion of using a random selection method through an online form ensures that the process is transparent and impartial.

One strength of your response is the emphasis on fairness and efficiency, which are crucial considerations in this situation. By proposing a systematic approach to ticket distribution, you mitigate the risk of bias or favoritism in selecting recipients. Furthermore, your solution balances the need to address the immediate ticket availability issue while allowing Callie to focus on her event preparation tasks.

However, a potential drawback of your answer is the lack of consideration for the personal relationships involved.
