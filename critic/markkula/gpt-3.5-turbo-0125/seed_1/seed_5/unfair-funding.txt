The suggested course of action to implement a blind review process for funding requests and establish clear evaluation criteria is a practical and actionable solution to address the potential bias in the funding allocation process. By removing identifying information and setting specific guidelines, Claire can ensure a fair and transparent decision-making process.

This approach effectively addresses the concerns of favoritism and ensures that funding decisions are based on merit rather than personal relationships. It also helps maintain a positive relationship with Garret and other committee members by promoting fairness and consistency in the distribution of funds.

However, one potential downside of this approach is that it may require additional time and resources to implement the blind review process and develop clear evaluation criteria. Claire will need to communicate effectively with the committee members to ensure they understand and adhere to the new guidelines.

Overall, the suggested solution strikes a good balance between addressing the ethical dilemma at hand and maintaining positive relationships within the student government. It provides a practical way forward for Claire to improve the fairness of the funding allocation process.
