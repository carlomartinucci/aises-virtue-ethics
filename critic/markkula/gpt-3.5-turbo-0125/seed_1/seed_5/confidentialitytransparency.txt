Your response as Akira is well-considered and tactful. You effectively communicate the reasons for asking the senator to leave while acknowledging his concerns. You prioritize privacy and integrity in handling the sensitive disciplinary issue, which is commendable. By emphasizing the importance of confidentiality and the need to protect the dignity of all involved, you show empathy and professionalism.

One potential improvement could be to offer the upset senator an alternative way to address his concerns or be kept informed without compromising the confidentiality of the disciplinary discussion. This could help address his desire for transparency while still maintaining the necessary confidentiality. Additionally, considering the lack of specific bylaws regarding executive privilege in the student government, it might be beneficial for Akira to work towards establishing clearer guidelines or procedures for handling such situations in the future.

Overall, your response effectively balances the ethical considerations of privacy and transparency in a challenging situation, demonstrating a commitment to upholding ethical standards while navigating interpersonal dynamics within the student government.
