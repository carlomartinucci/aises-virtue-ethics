The answer provided is fairly ethical in the sense that it encourages open communication and private resolution of the issue. By addressing John directly and expressing concerns about professionalism, Matt is taking a proactive approach to uphold the organization's reputation.

One positive aspect of the answer is that it acknowledges the complexities of the situation, such as the fear of backlash from other senators and the importance of maintaining professionalism. The suggestion to communicate privately with John shows a level of empathy towards a fellow student leader.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of consideration for the seriousness of John's actions, which involve underage drinking and public representation of the student government. While the answer focuses on resolving the issue discreetly, it may not fully address the underlying ethical concerns at play.

In conclusion, the answer provides a practical course of action for Matt to address the situation with John while weighing the potential consequences. To improve, Matt could also consider involving a higher authority within the organization to ensure appropriate measures are taken to address John's behavior in a more formal manner.
