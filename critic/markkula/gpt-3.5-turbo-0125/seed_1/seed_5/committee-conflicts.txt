The answer provided is a practical and actionable approach to Tyler's dilemma. By proposing a meeting with the University Affairs Committee members to discuss reallocating workload, Tyler shows initiative in finding a solution to balance his committee responsibilities with his desire to connect more with his constituents. Delegating some projects to others demonstrates a willingness to prioritize engaging with students, which aligns with his role as a senator representing their interests.

However, the answer could be improved by specifying potential strategies for effectively engaging with students once he frees up time. Tyler should consider concrete actions such as organizing town hall meetings, conducting surveys, or setting up regular office hours to gather feedback and address concerns directly from his constituents. This would ensure that his efforts to connect with students are purposeful and impactful.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing Tyler's situation, but adding more detailed plans for engaging with students would enhance the effectiveness of his approach.
