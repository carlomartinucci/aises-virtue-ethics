The answer provided is ethical as it advocates for transparency and authenticity in reflecting student conversations, which are crucial for the student government to accurately represent their constituency. By including the topic of the new statue and related jokes in the video, Carrie is staying true to her role in showcasing trending topics on campus. The suggestion to present the information in a balanced and objective manner, while highlighting diverse perspectives and encouraging open dialogue, demonstrates a thoughtful approach to addressing the issue.

However, the response could be improved by offering more specific strategies on how Carrie can mitigate potential negative impacts on donor relations and university resources. Providing actionable steps, such as seeking approval from university administration before including sensitive topics, or offering to feature positive aspects of the statue project alongside the criticisms, would enhance the practicality of the advice.

Overall, the answer is ethical and emphasizes the importance of authenticity and inclusivity in representing student voices. To enhance the response, it would benefit from more specific guidance on navigating the potential consequences of discussing controversial topics.
