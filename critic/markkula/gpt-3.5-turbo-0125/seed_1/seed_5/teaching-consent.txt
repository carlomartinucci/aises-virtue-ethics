Your answer is specific, practical, and actionable, which is commendable. By proposing a tailored workshop focusing on clear communication about consent for neurodiverse students, you are directly addressing the issue at hand. Incorporating visual aids, role-playing scenarios, and seeking feedback from the target audience are excellent strategies to ensure the effectiveness and relevance of the materials. This approach shows a proactive and empathetic response to the unique challenges faced by neurodiverse individuals in understanding consent.

However, one area for improvement could be to also consider involving neurodiverse individuals or experts in the planning and execution of the workshop. By including their perspectives and insights, you can further enhance the workshop's relevance and effectiveness. Additionally, ensuring that the workshop is inclusive and welcoming to all students, regardless of neurodiversity, is crucial to promoting a culture of consent and safety on campus.

Overall, your proposed actions demonstrate a practical and thoughtful approach to addressing the issue, with room for further refinement by incorporating direct input from neurodiverse individuals and promoting inclusivity in the workshop design.
