The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing the issue of AI detection tools in academia. By suggesting a thorough review of the latest research, collaboration with relevant stakeholders, and exploration of alternative strategies, the response demonstrates a proactive approach to tackling the problem. 

Positively, the answer acknowledges the complexities of the situation, particularly the potential biases and limitations of existing AI detection tools, and emphasizes the importance of considering the impact on students. Furthermore, the suggestion to promote academic integrity through education aligns with fostering a positive learning environment.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of explicit mention of advocating for transparency and accountability from companies like Turnitin regarding the limitations of their AI detection feature. It would be beneficial to include a plan for communicating with students about the use of such tools and ensuring that they are not unfairly penalized.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the issue of AI-generated text in student assignments but could be strengthened by incorporating strategies for improving fairness, transparency, and student communication in the process.
