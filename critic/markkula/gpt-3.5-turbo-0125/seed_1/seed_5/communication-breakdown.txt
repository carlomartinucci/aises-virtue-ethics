Your advice to Derek to schedule a one-on-one meeting with the Vice Provost to discuss the off-campus thefts affecting fraternity and sorority members is practical and actionable. By presenting the facts and emphasizing the impact on a large portion of the student body, Derek can effectively convey the urgency of the situation. Proposing solutions and highlighting the benefits of addressing these issues shows a proactive approach to problem-solving.

However, it's important to note that while advocating for students' needs is commendable, there is a risk of alienating the administration if Derek pushes too aggressively against their explicit goals and learning objectives. It would be beneficial for Derek to find a balance between representing student concerns authentically and working within the constraints of the administration's priorities.

Additionally, encouraging Derek to seek input and support from other student government leaders who may have faced similar challenges could provide him with additional perspectives and strategies for navigating the complex dynamics between students and administration.

Overall, your advice provides a practical approach for Derek to address the immediate issue while considering the long-term implications of maintaining relationships with the administration and preserving the credibility of the student government.
