This answer is quite ethical. It recognizes the potential conflict of interest in Miguel's dual roles and suggests a proactive solution to address it. By prioritizing his role in student government and stepping down from the executive position in the outdoor club, Miguel is taking a responsible and ethical approach to ensure neutrality and integrity in both roles. The suggestion to communicate openly with the club members, offer continued support in other ways, and emphasize the importance of ethical standards demonstrates a good understanding of the situation and a commitment to upholding ethical practices.

Overall, this response provides a practical and actionable solution to the ethical dilemma faced by Miguel. It offers a clear course of action that prioritizes integrity and transparency, while still allowing for support of the club in alternative capacities. This approach is commendable as it addresses the conflict of interest directly and aims to maintain trust and fairness in both roles.
