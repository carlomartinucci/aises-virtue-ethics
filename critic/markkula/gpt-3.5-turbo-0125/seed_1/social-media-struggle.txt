The answer provided is a practical and actionable solution to the scenario. It acknowledges the ethical dilemma Matt faces and provides a specific course of action for him to take. By privately messaging John, Matt can address his concerns while also offering a solution that allows John to rectify the situation without causing unnecessary public embarrassment. The suggestion to discuss the situation further in person shows a willingness to handle any potential fallout in a mature and responsible manner.

However, one potential downside is that the answer does not address the possibility that John may not take Matt's concerns seriously or may react negatively to the message. In such a case, Matt should be prepared to escalate the situation if necessary, perhaps by involving other members of the student government or seeking guidance from a higher authority within the organization.

Overall, the answer provides a good starting point for Matt to address the issue with John in a constructive and professional manner. It encourages open communication and offers a way for Matt to uphold the values of the organization while also considering the potential consequences of his actions.
