The answer provided is a practical and actionable response to the scenario presented. It suggests that Mary should engage in open communication with her brother Donald to discuss their differing viewpoints and potential consequences. The recommendation to propose a compromise solution that considers both financial and family dynamics is a positive step towards finding a resolution that benefits all shareholders. Additionally, highlighting the tax implications of selling the building and emphasizing the importance of family harmony are crucial ethical considerations in this situation.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific strategies for how Mary can navigate the conversation with Donald effectively. For instance, outlining specific talking points or negotiation tactics could enhance the practicality of the response. Additionally, addressing potential challenges that may arise during the discussion and offering solutions to overcome them would further strengthen the answer.

Overall, the response offers a solid foundation for guiding Mary's decision-making process, but it could benefit from more detailed and actionable steps to ensure a successful outcome in resolving the conflict within the family business.
