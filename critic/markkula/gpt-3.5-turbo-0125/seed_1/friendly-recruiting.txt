The answer provided is ethical as it considers the importance of fair representation and providing opportunities for growth to all candidates. It suggests a practical approach of reviewing the remaining candidates' applications, offering support and guidance to help them succeed, and encouraging friends to apply through the regular process.

Positively, the response emphasizes the importance of giving all candidates a chance and providing resources for their development. It also acknowledges the significance of having the right expertise and perspective on each committee.

However, a potential drawback is that the answer does not explicitly address the conflict of interest that Saumya faces by considering appointing her friends. It would be beneficial to include a clear plan on how to manage this conflict transparently and ensure that the selection process remains fair and unbiased.

Overall, the response provides a practical and actionable approach to the situation, focusing on supporting all candidates while also seeking the best fit for the committees. To improve, it could address the conflict of interest more directly and outline steps to mitigate it effectively.
