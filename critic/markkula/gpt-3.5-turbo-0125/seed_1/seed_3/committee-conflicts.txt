The answer provided is practical and actionable. Scheduling a meeting with the committee members to discuss reallocating some of the workload to focus on connecting with the student body shows a proactive approach to addressing Tyler's dilemma. By explaining his concerns and proposing a solution that involves delegating tasks to others, Tyler is attempting to strike a balance between his responsibilities to the committee and representing the needs of his constituents.

The positive aspects of this approach include recognizing the importance of staying connected with the student body, being transparent about his concerns, and seeking a collaborative solution within the committee. Delegating tasks to others shows a willingness to prioritize direct engagement with students while still fulfilling his committee duties.

However, a potential downside could be the reluctance or resistance from other committee members to take on additional tasks, especially if they are already overwhelmed with their own projects. Tyler should be prepared to negotiate and find compromises to ensure a successful reallocation of workload.

Overall, this approach is a practical way for Tyler to address his dilemma and align his priorities with representing the changing needs of his constituents. It demonstrates a proactive and collaborative mindset, but Tyler should be prepared to navigate potential challenges in reallocating tasks within the committee.
