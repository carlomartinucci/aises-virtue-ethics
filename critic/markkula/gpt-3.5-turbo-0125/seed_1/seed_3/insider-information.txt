The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of maintaining fairness and impartiality in the funding process. By advising Drake to stick to the online resources and tip guides, the answer promotes equal access to information for all student clubs and societies, which is commendable. This approach ensures transparency and integrity in the allocation of funds.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting that Drake offer to provide general advice or clarification to all student organizations, not just his friend Alex. This way, Drake can still offer assistance without showing favoritism. Additionally, it would be helpful to recommend that Drake communicate openly with Alex about the need to maintain professional boundaries and fairness in the funding process, fostering transparency and understanding in their relationship.
