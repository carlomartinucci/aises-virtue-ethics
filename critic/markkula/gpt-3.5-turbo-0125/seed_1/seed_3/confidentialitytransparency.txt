The answer provided is fairly ethical as it balances the importance of transparency with the need for privacy and confidentiality in handling sensitive disciplinary matters. By politely explaining the situation to the upset senator and requesting them to leave in a respectful manner, Akira is attempting to uphold the integrity of the process while addressing the concerns raised.

What could be improved in the answer is to also acknowledge the senator's perspective and concerns, showing empathy towards their feelings of being excluded and addressing them more directly. Additionally, Akira could consider discussing the lack of bylaws regarding executive privilege with the student government to establish clearer guidelines for handling similar situations in the future. This proactive approach would help prevent similar conflicts from arising and ensure consistency in decision-making processes.
