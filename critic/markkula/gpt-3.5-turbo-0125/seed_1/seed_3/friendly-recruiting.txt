The answer provided is a practical and actionable approach to Sauyma's situation. By reviewing the applications of the remaining candidates and considering providing resources for training and support, the answer acknowledges the importance of giving all applicants a fair chance. Additionally, reaching out to the candidates individually to discuss their potential for growth shows a commitment to helping them succeed in their roles.

Encouraging friends to apply for positions where they are a good fit is also a positive step to ensure the committees have the most qualified representatives. However, a potential downside could be the perception of favoritism towards Sauyma's friends, which may undermine the fairness of the selection process. To mitigate this, it would be beneficial to be transparent about the selection criteria and the reasons for encouraging specific individuals to apply.

Overall, the answer offers a balanced approach that aims to balance the need for qualified representatives with providing opportunities for growth to all candidates. Clear communication and transparency throughout the process would further strengthen the ethical considerations in this situation.
