The answer provided is practical and actionable. It addresses the issue directly by suggesting a meeting with Julia to discuss the misuse of office resources. The approach of calmly explaining the importance of following organization policies and expressing concerns about the budget is a good way to raise awareness of the problem. The suggestion of finding alternative solutions and offering assistance shows a collaborative effort to address the issue.

However, the response could benefit from being more assertive in conveying the gravity of the situation.

To further improve, the response could be strengthened by being more assertive in conveying the urgency of the matter and the need for immediate corrective action.
