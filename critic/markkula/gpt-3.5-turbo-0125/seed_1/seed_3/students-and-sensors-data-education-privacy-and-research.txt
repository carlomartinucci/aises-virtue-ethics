The answer provided is a good starting point for addressing the ethical concerns surrounding the use of student data by universities. By suggesting a review of current data practices, ensuring compliance with laws like FERPA, and assessing transparency, the answer demonstrates a commitment to legal and ethical standards. The consideration of the ethical implications and the need to balance benefits with privacy rights is commendable.

To improve the response, it could be more specific in recommending practical steps to enhance transparency and student choice. For example, suggesting the development of clear, easily accessible privacy policies for students, providing opt-out mechanisms for specific data collection practices, and involving students in discussions about data usage could further strengthen the approach.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the issue, but could benefit from more concrete recommendations on how to implement transparency and respect student privacy rights in practice.
