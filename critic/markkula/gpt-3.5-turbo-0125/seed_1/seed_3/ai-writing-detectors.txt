However, to further improve the response, it could benefit from specific examples of alternative strategies that could be implemented to supplement or replace reliance on AI detection tools. Providing concrete steps or case studies of successful implementations would enhance the practicality of the proposed solution.

Overall, the answer is commendable for its detailed approach and consideration of various perspectives, but could be strengthened by incorporating more specific examples of alternative strategies to tackle the issue effectively.
