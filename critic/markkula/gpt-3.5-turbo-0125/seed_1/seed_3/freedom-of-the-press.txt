The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of transparency and authenticity in representing the student body's conversations, even if the topic may not be favorable to the university administration or donors. By including the discussion on the new statue and related jokes in a balanced and objective manner, Carrie can accurately reflect the trending topics among students on campus.

However, the response could benefit from more specific strategies on how Carrie can mitigate the potential negative impact on donor relations and university resources. For instance, she could consider reaching out to the university administration beforehand to discuss the inclusion of the topic, providing them with context and explaining the importance of reflecting student sentiment. Additionally, Carrie could offer solutions or suggestions for addressing the concerns raised by students about the statue, thus demonstrating a proactive approach to problem-solving.

Overall, while the answer is commendable for its emphasis on transparency and authenticity, it could be strengthened by providing more actionable steps for Carrie to navigate the situation effectively and responsibly.
