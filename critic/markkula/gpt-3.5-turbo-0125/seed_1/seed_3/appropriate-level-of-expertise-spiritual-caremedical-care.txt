Your answer is specific and practical in addressing the situation with John. You appropriately express your concerns about his well-being and the potential risks associated with his recent behavior. Encouraging him to seek professional help from a counselor or therapist is a good step, as is offering to help him find suitable professional assistance. Continuing to provide spiritual guidance and prayers while emphasizing the importance of addressing mental health and addiction issues with appropriate professional help shows a balanced approach. To improve, you could also consider involving other members of the church community to provide additional support for John and his family during this difficult time.
