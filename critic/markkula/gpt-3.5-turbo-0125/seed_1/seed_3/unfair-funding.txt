The suggested course of action is specific and practical, providing clear steps for Claire to address the issue of potential bias in the funding approval process. Implementing a blind review process and establishing clear evaluation criteria are effective ways to ensure fairness and transparency in decision-making. These actions would help mitigate the influence of personal relationships and admiration for Garret, ultimately leading to more equitable distribution of funds among clubs.

However, it's important to note that while these measures are beneficial in promoting fairness, they may not entirely eliminate the perception of bias or favoritism. Claire should also consider addressing the underlying issue of unequal funding distribution among clubs with similar needs, which could involve revisiting the allocation process and criteria to ensure a more equitable distribution of resources. Additionally, open communication with Garret and the committee members about the changes being implemented would help maintain trust and collaboration within the student government.

Overall, the suggested actions provide a practical and actionable approach for Claire to address the fairness concerns in the funding approval process, but further steps may be needed to address underlying issues and maintain positive relationships within the student government.
