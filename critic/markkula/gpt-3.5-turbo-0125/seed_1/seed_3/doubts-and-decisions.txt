The answer provided is ethical as it encourages honest communication and prioritizes personal growth and alignment with interests. By scheduling a meeting with the President and Vice President, Leah is taking a proactive approach to address her concerns and express her gratitude for the offer. The response also highlights the importance of open dialogue in conveying her passion for specific areas within the organization, which is crucial for both personal fulfillment and maximizing impact.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific suggestions on how Leah could contribute to marketing efforts while still pursuing her passion in other areas. Offering concrete ideas or examples of how she could integrate her graphic design skills into the marketing role would demonstrate a proactive approach to finding a solution that benefits both Leah and the organization. Additionally, considerations for the impact on her friend and strategies for managing that relationship could have been included to address potential interpersonal conflicts. Overall, the response is ethical and practical, but could benefit from more actionable suggestions for navigating the situation effectively.
