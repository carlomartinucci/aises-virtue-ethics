The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it considers the importance of fairness and providing opportunities to all candidates, including those who actively applied. It also emphasizes the need for qualified and dedicated student representatives on the committees, which aligns with the goal of ensuring effective student governance.

One positive aspect of the response is the initial step of reviewing the applications of the remaining candidates to assess their potential suitability for the committees. This shows a willingness to give all applicants a fair chance and not dismiss them outright.

Additionally, the suggestion to provide resources and support to candidates who may need additional training or guidance demonstrates a commitment to helping them succeed in their roles, which is a proactive and positive approach.

However, one potential downside is the reliance on personal connections with Saumya's friends to fill the remaining committee positions. While it's understandable to want the best fit for the committees, this approach may raise concerns about favoritism and potentially undermine the credibility of the selection process.

To improve the response, it would be beneficial to involve other members of the student government or university staff in the decision-making process. Seeking input from a diverse group of individuals could provide different perspectives and help ensure a more transparent and inclusive selection process.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable approach to the situation, balancing the need for qualified representatives with fairness and support for all candidates. By incorporating additional perspectives and maintaining transparency, Saumya can enhance the integrity of the appointment process and promote a more inclusive student governance system.
