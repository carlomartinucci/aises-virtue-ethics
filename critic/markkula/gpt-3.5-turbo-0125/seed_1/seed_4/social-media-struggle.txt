The answer provided is fairly ethical as it emphasizes addressing the issue privately with John, highlighting the importance of professionalism and reputation. It suggests a constructive approach by offering to discuss the situation further in person to address any potential consequences. By recommending that John consider taking down the video or adjusting privacy settings, it shows a proactive effort to rectify the situation.

However, the answer could be improved by including a suggestion for Matt to consider seeking advice from a mentor or advisor within the student government to navigate the situation effectively. This additional step would provide Matt with additional support and guidance in handling a delicate matter involving a fellow senator.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable solution for Matt to address the issue while considering the potential implications for both himself and the organization.
