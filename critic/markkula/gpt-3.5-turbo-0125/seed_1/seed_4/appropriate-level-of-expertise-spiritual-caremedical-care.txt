Your response is ethical and practical. You have shown genuine concern for John's well-being and acknowledged your limitations in addressing his mental health and substance abuse concerns. By encouraging him to seek professional help, offering to assist in finding a suitable counselor or therapist, and providing resources and support, you are taking proactive steps to ensure John receives the help he needs. Additionally, continuing to offer spiritual guidance and prayers shows your commitment to supporting him holistically. Overall, your approach is compassionate, responsible, and focused on getting John the necessary professional support while continuing to provide spiritual care.

You could further improve your response by specifically addressing the potential consequences of not seeking professional help, such as the risks of untreated depression and relapse into alcoholism. Emphasizing the urgency of the situation and the importance of prioritizing his well-being could strengthen your message to John. Additionally, providing concrete steps on how to access mental health and substance abuse services within the community could empower him to take action.
