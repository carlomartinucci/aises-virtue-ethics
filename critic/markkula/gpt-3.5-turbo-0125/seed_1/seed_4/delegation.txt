The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing Bryson's situation. Scheduling individual meetings with each staff member to assess their workload and stress levels shows a proactive approach to understanding the team's challenges. Prioritizing neglected state-level advocacy work and communicating the importance of balancing responsibilities demonstrates a strategic decision-making process.

Positively, the answer emphasizes the importance of supporting the well-being of the team and ensuring tasks align with job descriptions and capabilities. The approach to redistributing tasks and seeking additional support to manage workload effectively is a good way to address the issue of over-delegation.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of specific details on how exactly tasks will be reassigned and how support will be provided. Providing more concrete steps on how to address the workload imbalance and ensure all responsibilities are adequately covered would enhance the answer's effectiveness.

Overall, the response offers a practical plan of action to address Bryson's dilemma and demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of both the team's well-being and the importance of fulfilling all aspects of the role.
