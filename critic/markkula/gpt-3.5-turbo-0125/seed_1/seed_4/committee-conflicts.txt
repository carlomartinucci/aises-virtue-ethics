The answer provided is practical and actionable in addressing Tyler's dilemma. Scheduling a meeting with the University Affairs Committee members to discuss reallocating workload shows initiative and a proactive approach to finding a solution. By explaining his concerns and proposing a solution to delegate some projects to free up time for engaging with students, Tyler is taking steps towards balancing his responsibilities to the committee and his constituents. Involving the committee in the discussion also demonstrates a collaborative effort to find a resolution that benefits both parties.

However, the answer could be improved by considering potential pushback or challenges from other committee members. It would be beneficial for Tyler to develop a more detailed plan on how to effectively delegate tasks and ensure that the workload is distributed fairly among the committee members. Additionally, Tyler should be prepared to address concerns about his productivity and achievements, possibly by highlighting the value of direct student engagement in improving campus services.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and specific course of action for Tyler to address his dilemma, but it could benefit from further planning and preparation for potential obstacles that may arise during the process of reallocating workload.
