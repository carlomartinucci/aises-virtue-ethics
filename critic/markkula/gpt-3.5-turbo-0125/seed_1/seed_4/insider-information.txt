The answer provided is ethical as it promotes fairness and impartiality in the funding process. By advising Drake to maintain a professional boundary with his friend Alex and directing him to use the available resources, it ensures that all student clubs have equal opportunities in accessing funding support. This approach helps uphold integrity and prevent favoritism or bias towards specific groups.

However, one potential drawback is that it may strain Drake's relationship with Alex, as his friend may feel disappointed or upset by the decision. To mitigate this, Drake could offer to provide general advice or support to all student organizations equally, rather than singling out Alex for personalized guidance. This way, Drake can still support his friend while upholding ethical standards in the funding process.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable solution to the dilemma, emphasizing the importance of fairness and impartiality. It encourages Drake to prioritize the integrity of the funding process while also maintaining positive relationships with student organizations.
