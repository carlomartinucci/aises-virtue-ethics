The answer provided is fairly ethical, as it acknowledges the importance of reflecting student conversations authentically while also considering the potential impact on donor relations and university resources. By suggesting that Carrie present the topic in a balanced and objective manner, showcasing different perspectives and opinions, the answer promotes transparency and open dialogue. Furthermore, the suggestion to frame the discussion constructively highlights the importance of fostering a respectful conversation around sensitive topics.

However, one potential drawback is the lack of specific strategies for mitigating any negative impact on donor relations and university resources. Offering concrete suggestions on how Carrie could navigate this delicate balance, such as providing context or offering solutions to address concerns raised by students, would enhance the practicality of the response. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of ensuring that the video does not come across as overly critical or disrespectful towards donors could further strengthen the ethical considerations in the answer.
