The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes honesty, transparency, and open communication in handling Grace's predicament. It encourages Grace to seek advice from senior members of the student government and discuss potential solutions, while also being transparent with her potential constituents about her graduation plans.

One positive aspect of the answer is the focus on involving others in the decision-making process, seeking input from senior members and being transparent with constituents. This approach fosters collaboration and allows for a more informed decision-making process.

However, one area for improvement could be to provide more specific suggestions for potential solutions that Grace could explore with the senior members of the student government. Offering concrete ideas for temporary replacements or alternative ways for Grace to contribute post-graduation would make the advice more actionable.

Additionally, while the answer encourages Grace to be transparent with her constituents, it could further emphasize the importance of managing expectations and clearly outlining the potential impact of her early graduation on her role as a senior class senator.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing Grace's situation ethically by promoting open communication and collaboration. To enhance its practicality, offering more specific solutions and emphasizing the importance of managing expectations would be beneficial.
