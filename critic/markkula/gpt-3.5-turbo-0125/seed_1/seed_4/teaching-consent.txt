The answer provided is specific and actionable, addressing the issue of vague consent descriptions for neurodiverse individuals in a practical manner. By proposing a workshop tailored for neurodiverse students with clear communication about consent, incorporating visual aids and role-playing scenarios, the response is detailed and offers a tangible solution to the problem at hand. Seeking feedback from neurodiverse students is also a positive step towards ensuring the effectiveness and relevance of the information presented.

However, one potential improvement could be to also involve neurodiverse individuals in the planning and development stages of the workshop to ensure their perspectives and specific needs are thoroughly considered from the outset. This could further enhance the inclusivity and effectiveness of the workshop. Additionally, the answer could have mentioned the importance of ongoing support and resources for neurodiverse students beyond the workshop to facilitate a comprehensive approach to addressing sexual assault prevention within this community.
