The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing the issue at hand. It suggests a proactive approach by arranging a face-to-face meeting with Alanna to address concerns and work towards a solution. The suggestion of proposing a clear plan of action, understanding Alanna's perspective, and involving a neutral mediator if necessary are all actionable steps that could potentially lead to a positive outcome.

One potential improvement could be to include a contingency plan in case Alanna remains uncooperative even after the meeting and mediation attempts. Having a backup plan in case the collaboration with RHA falls through would be wise to ensure the event's success and prevent last-minute chaos.

Overall, the answer offers practical steps to address the current issue while emphasizing the importance of maintaining the positive relationship between student government and RHA. It provides a good framework for Josh to navigate the situation effectively and ethically.
