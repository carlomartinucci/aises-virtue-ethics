The suggested course of action to implement a blind review process and establish clear evaluation criteria is a practical and actionable solution to address the perceived bias in funding allocation. By removing identifying information and setting objective criteria, Claire can ensure that funding decisions are made based on merit rather than personal relationships. This approach promotes fairness and transparency in the distribution of funds, which is commendable.

However, it is important to acknowledge that implementing a blind review process may not completely eliminate bias, as committee members may still have implicit biases or knowledge of the clubs submitting requests. Therefore, it would be beneficial for Claire to also provide training on unconscious bias to the committee members to further mitigate any potential bias in the decision-making process.

Overall, the suggested solution is a step in the right direction towards creating a fairer system for allocating funds. It is practical and provides actionable steps for improving the current situation while maintaining positive relationships within the student government committee.
