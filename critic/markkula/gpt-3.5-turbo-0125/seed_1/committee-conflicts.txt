The answer provided is practical and actionable in addressing Tyler's dilemma. By scheduling a meeting with the committee members to discuss reallocating workload, Tyler is taking a proactive approach to finding a solution that balances his responsibilities to the committee and his constituents. By explaining his concerns and proposing a solution that involves delegating tasks to others, Tyler is showing initiative in addressing the issue of feeling disconnected from the student body.

However, one potential downside is that the success of this approach relies heavily on the willingness of other committee members to take on additional tasks. If they are not receptive to the idea or if there is resistance to reallocating workload, Tyler may face challenges in achieving his goal of connecting more with his constituency.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and specific course of action for Tyler to consider, but it would be beneficial to also have a backup plan in case the proposed solution does not yield the desired results.
