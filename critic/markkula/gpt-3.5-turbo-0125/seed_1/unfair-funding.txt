The suggested course of action to implement a blind review process for funding requests and establish clear evaluation criteria is a practical and actionable solution to address the potential bias in the funding allocation process. By removing identifying information and setting objective criteria, Claire can ensure that funding decisions are based on merit rather than personal relationships or influence.

This approach promotes fairness and transparency in the distribution of funds, which is commendable. It also acknowledges the need to maintain a positive relationship with Garret and the other committee members while addressing the underlying issue of unequal funding distribution.

However, one potential drawback of this solution is that it may not fully address the root cause of the issue, which is the perception of favoritism or bias due to Garret's involvement with the club. While the blind review process helps mitigate bias during the evaluation stage, it does not address the potential influence that Garret's involvement may have on the overall decision-making process.

To further enhance the effectiveness of this solution, Claire could consider implementing additional measures to ensure that all committee members are aware of the importance of impartiality and fairness in their decision-making. This could involve providing training on ethical considerations in funding allocation and reinforcing the importance of upholding the integrity of the process.

Overall, the suggested course of action is a practical step towards promoting fairness and transparency in the funding allocation process, but additional measures may be needed to address the underlying issues of perception and influence within the committee.
