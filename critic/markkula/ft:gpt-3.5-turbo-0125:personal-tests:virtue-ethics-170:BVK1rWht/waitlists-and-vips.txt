The answer provided is ethical. It addresses the issue of fairness by rectifying the errors in data entry and creating a waiting list to give other seniors who were turned away a chance to attend the event. By setting a deadline for responses and randomly selecting five seniors from the waiting list, the answer ensures transparency and fairness in the distribution of the remaining tickets. It also acknowledges the importance of upholding integrity and providing equal opportunities for all seniors to participate in the Senior Ball. The suggested course of action is practical and feasible given the time constraints Callie is facing.
