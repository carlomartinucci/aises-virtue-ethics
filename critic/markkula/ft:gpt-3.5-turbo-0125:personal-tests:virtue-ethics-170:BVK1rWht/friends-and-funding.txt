Your answer is ethical. By choosing to recuse yourself from the vote and informing the Senate about the conflict of interest, you are prioritizing fairness and impartiality in the decision-making process. You also suggest a practical solution by proposing to postpone the vote until a later meeting when more senators are present to ensure a more representative decision. This demonstrates a clear understanding of the ethical considerations at play in this scenario and a practical approach to addressing them. Well done.
