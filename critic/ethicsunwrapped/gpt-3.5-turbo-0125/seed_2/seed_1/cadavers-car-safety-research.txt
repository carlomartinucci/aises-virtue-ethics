The answer provided is specific and actionable in addressing the ethical concerns raised by the scenario. By suggesting an investigation into the process of obtaining cadavers, reviewing documentation, and recommending disciplinary action if ethical standards were breached, it shows a clear path towards addressing the issue. Furthermore, the proposal to implement stricter regulations for the ethical use of human cadavers in research is a proactive step towards preventing similar incidents in the future.

However, one potential drawback is the lack of consideration for the argument that the research may have saved lives. While ethics and consent are paramount, the potential benefits of the research should also be weighed against the ethical concerns. It would be beneficial to acknowledge this aspect and suggest ways to balance the ethical considerations with the potential benefits of the research.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and specific approach to addressing the ethical issues raised in the scenario, but could benefit from a more balanced consideration of both the ethical concerns and potential benefits of the research.
