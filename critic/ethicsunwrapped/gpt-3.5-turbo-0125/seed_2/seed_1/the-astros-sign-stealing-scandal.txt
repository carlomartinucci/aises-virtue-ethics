The answer provided is ethical as it aligns with the principles of fairness and integrity in sports. By reporting the sign-stealing scheme to the appropriate authorities within MLB and providing all available evidence, the individual is promoting transparency and upholding the rules and values of the game.

The action of reporting the cheating scandal is commendable as it seeks to maintain the integrity of baseball and ensure a level playing field for all teams. By bringing the wrongdoing to light, it allows for accountability and disciplinary actions to be taken against those involved, preventing similar incidents in the future and restoring trust in the sport.

However, the answer lacks specific details on how the individual would gather the evidence or handle potential repercussions of reporting such a high-profile scandal. It would be beneficial to include a plan for protecting oneself from potential backlash or retaliation, as whistleblowing can sometimes lead to personal risks.

Overall, while the action of reporting the sign-stealing scheme is the right thing to do, the response could be enhanced by including a more detailed strategy for gathering evidence, ensuring personal safety, and following up on the outcome of the investigation.
