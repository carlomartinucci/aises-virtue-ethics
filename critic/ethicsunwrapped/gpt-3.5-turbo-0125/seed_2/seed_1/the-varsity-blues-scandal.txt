The answer provided focuses on addressing the impact of the scandal on the students involved, which is a positive step in mitigating the consequences of the fraud. By suggesting the establishment of a task force involving education professionals and mental health experts, the response acknowledges the need for comprehensive support for these students.

However, the answer could benefit from more specific actions to ensure accountability and justice for all parties involved. It would be helpful to include measures such as conducting thorough investigations to identify all students who gained admission through fraudulent means and implementing appropriate consequences for those students, including potential revocation of their admissions. Additionally, outlining steps to prevent such fraudulent practices in the future, such as enhancing oversight and transparency in college admissions processes, would add a more proactive element to the response.

Overall, while the focus on supporting affected students is commendable, the response could be strengthened by including more concrete steps to address the broader implications of the scandal and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
