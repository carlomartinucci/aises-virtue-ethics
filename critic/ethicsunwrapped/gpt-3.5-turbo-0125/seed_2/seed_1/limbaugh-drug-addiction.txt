However, the answer could be improved by offering more specific actions or recommendations on how to provide support and resources for individuals struggling with addiction. Suggestions such as endorsing evidence-based treatment options, advocating for policies that prioritize addiction treatment over punitive measures, and promoting education and awareness campaigns could have made the response even more actionable and practical. By providing concrete steps to address the issue, the answer could have been more effective in guiding ethical behavior in this context.
