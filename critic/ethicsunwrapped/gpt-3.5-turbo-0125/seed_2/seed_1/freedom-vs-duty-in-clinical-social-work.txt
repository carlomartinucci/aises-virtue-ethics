The suggested course of action is fair and practical. Consulting with a supervisor or ethics committee is a responsible step to take when facing a challenging ethical dilemma. Seeking guidance from a higher authority can help the social worker navigate the conflict between their personal beliefs and professional duties. It also emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the client's well-being and ensuring they receive unbiased care. Additionally, reflecting on personal biases and exploring strategies to manage them is crucial for maintaining professionalism and providing effective mental health services.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples of strategies the social worker could use to manage their biases. For instance, attending cultural competency training, seeking supervision or consultation specifically focused on working with LGBTQ+ clients, or engaging in personal reflection and self-awareness exercises could be suggested. These concrete actions would enhance the practicality of the response and offer the social worker tangible steps to address the ethical dilemma more effectively.
