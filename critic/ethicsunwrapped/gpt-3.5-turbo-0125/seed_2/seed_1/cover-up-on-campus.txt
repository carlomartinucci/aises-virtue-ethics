The answer provided is ethical as it advocates for transparency, accountability, and taking appropriate actions to address the mishandling of sexual assault cases at Baylor University. By reporting the details and findings of the investigation to the authorities, cooperating with ongoing investigations, and holding responsible parties accountable, the answer addresses the serious issues that occurred under Art Briles' tenure at Baylor.

The positive aspects of this response include the emphasis on ensuring that the information is properly documented and legal actions are initiated, as well as the call for cooperation with authorities to provide further information or evidence. By advocating for accountability and measures to prevent future incidents, the answer aligns with ethical principles of justice and transparency.

However, one area for improvement is to also stress the importance of supporting the victims of sexual assault and ensuring that they receive the necessary care and resources. While holding responsible parties accountable is crucial, it is equally important to prioritize the well-being and justice for the survivors of these traumatic incidents.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and actionable plan for addressing the ethical violations at Baylor University, but could benefit from further emphasis on supporting the victims and survivors of sexual assault throughout the process.
