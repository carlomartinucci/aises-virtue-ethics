The answer provided is clear and specific in terms of following legal obligations and court orders. By emphasizing the importance of upholding the rule of law and supporting the investigation of a terrorist attack for national security and justice, it demonstrates a commitment to legal compliance and societal well-being. However, the evaluation lacks consideration for the broader implications of creating a backdoor into encrypted devices, potentially compromising the privacy and security of all users. It also does not address the concerns raised by Apple and its supporters regarding the violation of free speech rights and the potential abuse of such access by government agencies. 

To improve the evaluation, it would be beneficial to acknowledge the complex ethical dilemmas at play, such as balancing national security with individual privacy rights and the potential long-term consequences of setting precedents for government access to private technology. Additionally, discussing alternative approaches that could address the investigative needs while safeguarding privacy and security concerns would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the situation.
