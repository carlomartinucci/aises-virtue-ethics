The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of reporting the findings of the investigation to the appropriate authorities, cooperating with ongoing investigations, and holding accountable those responsible for the mishandling of sexual assault cases. By taking these actions, justice can be served, and steps can be taken to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

The answer is specific and actionable, focusing on concrete steps that can be taken to address the issue at hand. By reporting the details to law enforcement and regulatory bodies, ensuring full cooperation with investigations, and holding individuals accountable, the necessary measures to address the misconduct are outlined clearly.

However, one area for improvement could be to also mention the importance of providing support and resources to the victims of sexual assault. Ensuring that the survivors receive proper care, counseling, and support should also be a priority in addition to the legal and investigative actions outlined in the response. This would demonstrate a more comprehensive approach to addressing the issue and prioritizing the well-being of those affected.
