The answer provided is specific and actionable, outlining a clear plan of action to investigate the unauthorized bonuses and financial transactions during Dennis Kozlowski's tenure as CEO at Tyco International. By conducting a thorough review of financial records, documentation, board meeting minutes, internal controls, and interviewing key personnel, the response demonstrates a methodical approach to uncovering the truth behind the allegations.

On the positive side, the plan to review all relevant documents and conduct interviews with key personnel shows a commitment to thoroughness and diligence in investigating the matter. This approach will help in understanding the authorization process for the transactions in question and shed light on any potential lapses in internal controls or policies that may have contributed to the financial misconduct.

However, on the negative side, the evaluation could be enhanced by explicitly stating the importance of following ethical guidelines and legal regulations throughout the investigation. Emphasizing the need for transparency, accountability, and integrity in handling the review of financial records and conducting interviews would strengthen the ethical framework of the response.

In summary, while the answer provides a detailed and practical plan for investigating the unauthorized bonuses and financial transactions at Tyco International, it could benefit from a clearer emphasis on ethical considerations and adherence to legal standards throughout the process.
