In your response, you have outlined a series of actionable steps that focus on ensuring a fair legal process for Edward Snowden, advocating for legal representation, and promoting public debate on government surveillance programs. This approach demonstrates a practical and specific response to the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario.

One positive aspect of your answer is the emphasis on upholding due process and providing Snowden with legal representation. This highlights a commitment to fairness and justice, which are crucial elements in addressing complex ethical issues.

Furthermore, your suggestion to engage in public debate fosters transparency and encourages critical thinking about the balance between national security and individual privacy.
