By refraining from reporting graphic and unnecessary details about Robin Williams' suicide, the answer suggests focusing on reporting the broader context of mental health issues, suicide prevention resources, and the importance of seeking help. This approach honors the memory of Robin Williams while being sensitive to the impact of media coverage on his family and the public perception of suicide.

The good in this answer lies in its clear direction to prioritize privacy and dignity, highlighting the importance of responsible journalism when reporting on sensitive topics like suicide.
