The answer provided demonstrates a practical and actionable approach to understanding the factors contributing to Costco's success in treating employees well. By proposing a detailed analysis comparing Costco's business model with those of Walmart and Target, the responder aims to identify specific practices and strategies that lead to Costco's ethical reputation. This approach is commendable as it seeks to delve into multiple aspects such as wage levels, benefits packages, training programs, turnover rates, and productivity levels to draw meaningful conclusions.

However, the response could be improved by incorporating a more explicit plan on how to conduct this analysis. For instance, outlining specific metrics to be compared, setting a timeline for data collection and analysis, and detailing the methodology for drawing conclusions would enhance the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for investigating the relationship between company practices, employee treatment, and business success, but could benefit from additional clarity and specificity in outlining the steps to be taken in conducting the analysis.
