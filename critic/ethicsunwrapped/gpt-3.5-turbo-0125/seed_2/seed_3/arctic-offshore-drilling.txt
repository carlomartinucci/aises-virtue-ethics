The answer provided is ethical as it suggests conducting a comprehensive environmental impact assessment before making a decision on expanding offshore drilling in the Arctic. This approach considers the potential risks to the environment, wildlife, and indigenous communities, which aligns with ethical principles of environmental stewardship and accountability.

Positively, the suggestion of an environmental impact assessment demonstrates a commitment to understanding the consequences of offshore drilling on the Arctic ecosystem. It also emphasizes the importance of informed decision-making based on empirical data, which is crucial in balancing economic interests with environmental protection.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of specificity in addressing how the assessment would be carried out, who would be involved, and how the findings would be utilized in the decision-making process. Providing more details on these aspects would enhance the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In conclusion, while the answer is commendable for prioritizing environmental impact assessment, further elaboration on the implementation and utilization of the assessment findings would strengthen its ethical and actionable nature.
