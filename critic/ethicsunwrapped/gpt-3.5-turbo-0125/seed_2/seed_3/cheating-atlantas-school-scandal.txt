The answer provided is ethical because it emphasizes the importance of upholding ethical standards and integrity in education. It offers practical and actionable steps to support students without compromising ethical principles. By suggesting alternative ways to help students, such as providing additional tutoring and implementing targeted interventions, the answer shows a commitment to finding solutions that are both effective and ethical.

Moreover, the answer encourages open communication and seeking support from educational authorities to address the underlying issues affecting the school, which is a proactive approach to addressing systemic problems rather than resorting to cheating.

However, one area for improvement could be to also address the potential consequences of refusing the principal's request, such as potential retaliation or negative impact on job security. Offering strategies to navigate these challenges while still upholding ethical principles would enhance the practicality of the response. Similarly, outlining specific steps to report unethical behavior and seek external support could further strengthen the actionability of the answer.
