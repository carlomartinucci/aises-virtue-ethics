The response provided offers practical and actionable steps for addressing the ethical concerns surrounding President Ford's decision to pardon Nixon. Recommending transparent communication, engaging with the media and the public, and being open to feedback are all positive steps that could help rebuild trust with the American people. Moreover, the suggestion to establish an independent commission for further transparency is a proactive measure that could lend credibility to the pardon decision.

However, the answer could be improved by offering more specific details on how President Ford could effectively engage in transparent communication. Providing concrete examples of what President Ford could communicate, how he could address specific concerns raised by the public, and outlining a clear plan for establishing the independent commission would enhance the response's practicality.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the need for transparency and accountability in government actions, but could be strengthened by offering more specific and detailed recommendations for President Ford to effectively address the public outrage and suspicions surrounding the Nixon pardon.
