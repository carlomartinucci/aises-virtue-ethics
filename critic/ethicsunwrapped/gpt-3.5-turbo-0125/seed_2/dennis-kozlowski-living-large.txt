The answer provided is specific and actionable in addressing the ethical concerns surrounding Dennis Kozlowski's unauthorized bonuses and financial misconduct at Tyco International. By proposing a thorough review of financial records, documentation, board meeting minutes, internal controls, policies, and interviews with key personnel, the response demonstrates a proactive approach to understanding the authorization process for these transactions.

Positively, the answer emphasizes the importance of examining the relevant documents and internal controls to determine the legitimacy of the transactions in question. By conducting interviews with key personnel, it shows a commitment to gaining insights into the decision-making process and understanding the circumstances surrounding the unauthorized bonuses.

However, a potential drawback could be the lack of mention of potential external oversight or involvement, such as bringing in independent auditors or regulatory bodies to ensure impartiality and transparency in the review process. Additionally, while the answer focuses on the internal mechanisms and processes within Tyco, it could benefit from addressing broader ethical considerations and implications beyond just the legality of the transactions.

Overall, the response is practical and specific in its proposed actions to investigate the financial misconduct, but it could be enhanced by considering external oversight and broader ethical dimensions in the review process.
