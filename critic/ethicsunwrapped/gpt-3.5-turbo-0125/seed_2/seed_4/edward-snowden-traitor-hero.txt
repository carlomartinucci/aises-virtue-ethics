Your answer provides a practical and actionable approach to the Edward Snowden scenario. By advocating for a fair legal process for Snowden and supporting public debate on government surveillance, you aim to address the complexities of the situation. 

The positive aspects of your response include promoting transparency, upholding the rule of law by ensuring legal representation for Snowden, and fostering a constructive dialogue on important issues such as government surveillance and civil liberties. These actions can lead to a more informed and democratic decision-making process.

However, a potential drawback is that your answer does not explicitly address the ethical dimension of Snowden's actions. While you focus on legal processes and public debate, a more comprehensive evaluation could have included a discussion on the ethical considerations of whistleblowing, government transparency, and individual rights.

Overall, your response offers practical steps to navigate the Snowden case, but it could benefit from a deeper analysis of the ethical implications involved.
