The answer provided is ethical in that it advocates for transparency, accountability, and taking appropriate actions to address the mishandling of sexual assault cases at Baylor University. By reporting the findings of the investigation to the relevant authorities and cooperating with ongoing investigations, it aims to ensure that justice is served and steps are taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.

The strength of this response lies in its emphasis on taking concrete actions to address the issue at hand. By involving law enforcement and regulatory bodies, it seeks to hold accountable those responsible for the failures in addressing sexual assault cases. Additionally, cooperating with investigations demonstrates a commitment to providing further information and evidence to support the pursuit of justice.

However, a potential improvement could be to also highlight the importance of implementing systemic changes within the institution to prevent such failures from occurring again. While reporting and cooperating with investigations are crucial steps, advocating for reforms in policies, procedures, and campus culture to prioritize the safety and well-being of all students would further strengthen the ethical stance of the response. It is essential not only to address the immediate consequences of the mishandling of cases but also to proactively work towards creating a safer environment for all members of the university community.
