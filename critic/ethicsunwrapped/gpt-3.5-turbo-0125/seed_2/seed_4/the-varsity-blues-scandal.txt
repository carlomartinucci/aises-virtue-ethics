Your answer is specific and actionable, focusing on creating a task force to support the affected students in the aftermath of the scandal. By involving education professionals and mental health experts, you aim to provide necessary resources for their academic and emotional well-being, which is a positive step in addressing the situation. This approach recognizes the students' well-being as a priority and acknowledges the impact of the fraudulent admissions on their college experience.

However, it would be beneficial to also consider addressing the broader implications of the scandal, such as implementing stricter oversight and accountability measures to prevent similar fraudulent activities in the future. By not addressing the systemic issues that allowed this scandal to occur, there is a risk that similar incidents may happen again. Additionally, involving the students in discussions about the situation and providing transparency about the steps being taken to rectify the wrongs done could help rebuild trust and integrity within the affected institutions.

Overall, your response is practical and focuses on a specific action to support the students, but it could be further strengthened by considering preventative measures and involving the broader community in the process of addressing the scandal.
