The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the safety and well-being of the victims by reporting the incident to the authorities promptly. By advocating for immediate action and intervention, it acknowledges the significance of holding the perpetrator accountable and preventing further harm to potential victims. The response highlights the crucial role of external authorities in handling such serious matters and does not support internal handling or keeping the information quiet.

However, the evaluation could be improved by suggesting additional steps that could have been taken to ensure a more comprehensive and proactive approach to addressing the situation. For instance, recommending that the individual should have also reached out to the victim to offer support and assistance, as well as advocating for systemic changes within the institution to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Furthermore, acknowledging the need for ongoing monitoring and follow-up to verify that appropriate actions are being taken by the authorities would enhance the evaluation's practicality and actionability.
