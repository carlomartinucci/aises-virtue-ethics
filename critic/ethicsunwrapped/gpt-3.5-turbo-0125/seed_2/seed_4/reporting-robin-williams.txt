The answer is ethical as it prioritizes respecting the privacy and dignity of the deceased and their family. By refraining from reporting graphic details about Robin Williams' suicide and instead focusing on broader mental health issues and suicide prevention resources, the answer demonstrates sensitivity and empathy towards all affected parties.

Positively, the answer acknowledges the potential harm of sensationalizing suicide and providing "how-to" information, showing a commitment to responsible reporting. By highlighting the importance of honoring Robin Williams' memory and considering the impact of media coverage on the family and the public, the answer promotes ethical journalism practices.

However, it could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how to balance the public's right to know with the need for sensitivity. For example, suggesting ways to discuss suicide in a responsible manner, such as including information on available support services or expert opinions on suicide prevention, would enhance the answer's practicality and actionable steps.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of ethical considerations in journalism but could benefit from more specific recommendations on how to ethically report on sensitive topics like suicide.
