The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it advocates for a careful legal review of President Roosevelt's actions to ensure adherence to constitutional and legal boundaries. By recommending a thorough examination of Roosevelt's policies, the response promotes accountability and respect for the rule of law within the administration. This approach also aims to prevent potential conflicts within the party and promote a more systematic decision-making process based on legal considerations.

However, the response could be improved by offering more specific steps on how to conduct the legal review effectively. Providing guidance on the scope of the review, the criteria for assessing overreach, and the process for implementing any necessary changes would enhance the practicality of the recommendation. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of transparency and consultation with legal experts in this review process would strengthen the ethical foundation of the proposed course of action.
