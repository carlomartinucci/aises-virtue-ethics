The answer provided is ethical in the context of the scenario presented. By recommending a thorough legal review of President Roosevelt's actions and advocating for adherence to legal boundaries and precedents, the response promotes a principled approach to governance that respects the rule of law and constitutional limits on executive power.

One positive aspect of the answer is the focus on conducting a legal review to assess the legality of President Roosevelt's actions. This demonstrates a commitment to upholding legal standards and ensuring that presidential decisions are grounded in a clear understanding of the Constitution and existing laws.

Furthermore, the advice to prioritize adherence to legal boundaries and precedents in decision-making is sound, as it promotes a more cautious and measured approach to governance that seeks to prevent potential conflicts and maintain the integrity of the legal system.

However, a potential drawback of the response is the lack of consideration for the broader implications of challenging or reversing President Roosevelt's policies. While legal review is important, it is also essential to assess the practical consequences of such actions on national interests, public opinion, and political stability.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable recommendation for addressing the tensions between the stewardship and strict constructionist models of the presidency, emphasizing the importance of legal scrutiny and adherence to legal principles in decision-making.
