Your answer is ethical as it promotes honesty and integrity in education, prioritizing the well-being and academic growth of students. Refusing to participate in cheating and seeking alternative means to support students are commendable actions that align with ethical standards in the field of education. By advocating for additional resources and addressing the underlying issues affecting the school, you demonstrate a commitment to long-term solutions rather than short-term, unethical practices.

However, one area for improvement is the need for more concrete steps on how to address the pressure to cheat with the school administration and seek support from educational authorities. Providing specific strategies or actions to navigate these conversations and advocate for change would enhance the practicality of your response. Additionally, outlining a plan for ongoing ethical behavior and integrity in challenging situations would further strengthen your approach in dealing with similar dilemmas in the future.
