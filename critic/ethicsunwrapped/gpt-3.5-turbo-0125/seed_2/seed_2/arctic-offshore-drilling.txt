The answer provided is ethical as it proposes conducting a comprehensive environmental impact assessment before proceeding with offshore drilling in the Arctic. This approach demonstrates a commitment to understanding the potential risks and consequences of such activities on the environment, wildlife, and local communities. By analyzing mitigation measures and feasibility, it aims to make an informed decision that considers the broader impact beyond just economic benefits.

Positively, conducting an environmental impact assessment is a responsible and necessary step to ensure informed decision-making and to assess the potential harm to the delicate Arctic ecosystem. It shows a recognition of the importance of environmental preservation and the need to balance economic interests with ecological concerns.

However, a potential drawback is the time and resources required to conduct such a comprehensive assessment. Delays in the approval process could impact economic benefits and energy security goals. Additionally, there is a risk of bias in the assessment process depending on who conducts it and how transparent the findings are.

To improve, it would be beneficial to involve a diverse group of stakeholders, including environmental experts, local indigenous communities, and industry representatives, in the assessment process to ensure a well-rounded evaluation. Transparency in the assessment findings and a commitment to implementing recommended mitigation measures are essential for upholding the ethical intent of the proposed action.
