The answer provided is specific and actionable in addressing the ethical concerns raised by the use of human cadavers in research at Heidelberg University and Wayne State University. By proposing an investigation into the process of obtaining the cadavers and ensuring proper consent was obtained, the response aims to hold researchers and institutions accountable for their actions. Recommending disciplinary action if unethical practices are found and advocating for stricter regulations to prevent future incidents demonstrates a commitment to upholding ethical standards in research involving human subjects.

However, the answer could be further improved by considering the broader implications of such research practices beyond just the process of obtaining cadavers. It would be beneficial to also address the ethical considerations surrounding the necessity of using human cadavers in crash tests compared to alternative methods, such as crash test dummies. Exploring the potential alternatives and weighing the ethical implications of each approach would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the situation.

Overall, the response is practical and specific in its proposed actions to address the ethical concerns raised by the use of human cadavers in research, but could benefit from a more thorough analysis of the ethical considerations surrounding the research methods themselves.
