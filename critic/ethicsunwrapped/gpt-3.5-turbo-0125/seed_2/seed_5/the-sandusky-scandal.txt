By taking immediate action and involving the proper authorities, potential future harm could have been prevented, and justice could have been served for the victims of Jerry Sandusky's abuse.

The answer also acknowledges the critical role of external intervention in handling such a serious issue, rather than attempting to handle it internally or keep it quiet. This demonstrates a commitment to accountability and transparency in addressing cases of abuse and misconduct.

However, the answer could be further enhanced by highlighting the need for ongoing support and advocacy for victims of abuse, as well as the importance of creating a safe environment for individuals to come forward with any concerns or allegations. Additionally, emphasizing the significance of educating and raising awareness about child abuse prevention and reporting mechanisms would contribute to a more comprehensive approach in addressing such incidents effectively.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and actionable response to the scenario by advocating for reporting the abuse to the authorities promptly, but could be strengthened by incorporating additional measures to support victims and prevent future incidents of abuse.
