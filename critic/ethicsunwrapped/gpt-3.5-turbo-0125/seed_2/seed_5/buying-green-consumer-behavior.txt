The answer provided is specific and actionable in addressing the issue raised by the studies conducted by psychologists Nina Mazar and Chen-Bo Zhong regarding the potential negative effects of green consumer behavior. By recommending further research to explore the underlying mechanisms and conducting qualitative interviews or surveys with consumers, the answer seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the motivations and attitudes driving ethical consumption.

Additionally, proposing experimental studies to test interventions aimed at mitigating the negative effects of moral licensing, such as implementing prompts or reminders, demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing the identified behavior patterns. This suggests a practical and strategic way to tackle the potential ethical dilemmas associated with green consumer behavior.

However, the answer could be further strengthened by providing more specific details on the types of interventions that could be tested, as well as outlining a plan for how the research and interventions could be implemented in real-world settings. By offering a more detailed and comprehensive strategy for addressing the issue, the answer could be even more effective in promoting consistent ethical conduct among green product consumers.
