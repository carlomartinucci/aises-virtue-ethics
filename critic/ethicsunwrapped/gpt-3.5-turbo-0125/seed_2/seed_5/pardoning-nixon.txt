The answer provided acknowledges the complexity of President Ford's decision to pardon Nixon and offers practical steps to address the public outrage and suspicions. Recommending transparent communication through press conferences, detailed statements, and openness to feedback is a positive approach to rebuilding trust with the American people. By suggesting the establishment of an independent commission to review the pardon decision, the answer also highlights the importance of accountability and transparency in government actions.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific details on how President Ford could address the public's concerns effectively. For instance, outlining a timeline for when these communication efforts should take place, setting clear objectives for the independent commission, and offering concrete steps to engage with critics could enhance the actionable nature of the response.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a sound understanding of the need for transparency and accountability in the aftermath of the Nixon pardon but would benefit from additional specificity and actionable steps to ensure a more comprehensive and effective approach to rebuilding public trust.
