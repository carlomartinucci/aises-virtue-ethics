The answer provided is a practical and actionable response to the scenario presented. By advocating for an investigation into the process of obtaining the cadavers at Heidelberg University and Wayne State University, it addresses the core issue of ethical sourcing and consent. The suggestion to review documentation and recommend disciplinary action if necessary demonstrates a commitment to holding accountable those responsible for any wrongdoing. Furthermore, proposing the implementation of stricter regulations for the ethical use of human cadavers shows a proactive approach to preventing similar ethical lapses in the future.

However, the answer could be strengthened by elaborating on the specific steps that could be taken during the investigation process. For instance, detailing the involvement of relevant oversight bodies or legal authorities in conducting the investigation would provide a clearer roadmap for addressing the ethical concerns raised in the scenario. Additionally, outlining potential consequences for non-compliance with ethical standards and ensuring transparency in the investigative process would enhance the effectiveness of the proposed actions.
