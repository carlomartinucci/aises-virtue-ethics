Your response focuses on providing practical support for the affected students, which is a positive step in addressing the consequences of the scandal. Establishing a task force with a diverse range of expertise is a good approach to ensure comprehensive support for the students' academic and emotional needs. By offering resources like tutoring and counseling, you aim to help these students succeed in college despite the dishonest means through which they gained admission.

However, it would be beneficial to also address the broader implications of the scandal, such as the erosion of trust in the education system and the impact on future college applicants. Implementing measures to prevent similar fraudulent practices in the future and promoting transparency and fairness in college admissions could be additional actions to consider. Furthermore, acknowledging the ethical breach and discussing ways to prevent such misconduct in the future would be essential for promoting integrity within the education system.

Overall, your response provides a practical and actionable solution to support the affected students, but it could be strengthened by including measures to prevent future unethical behavior and restore trust in the college admissions process.
