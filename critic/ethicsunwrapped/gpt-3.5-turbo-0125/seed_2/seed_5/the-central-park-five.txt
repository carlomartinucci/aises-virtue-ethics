The answer provided is ethical as it aims to raise awareness about the Central Park 5 case and advocate for systemic changes to prevent similar injustices. By organizing public events, collaborating with advocacy groups and legal experts, and pushing for reforms in police practices and the criminal justice system, the answer promotes justice and accountability.
