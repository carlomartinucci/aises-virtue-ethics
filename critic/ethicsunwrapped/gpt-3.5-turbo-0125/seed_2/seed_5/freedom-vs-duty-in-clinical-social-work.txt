The answer provided is practical and actionable. By suggesting that the social worker consult with a supervisor or ethics committee within their organization, it addresses the need for seeking guidance in a professional setting. It also emphasizes the importance of considering the client's best interests and ensuring they receive appropriate care, which aligns with the ethical duty of providing optimal service and "doing no harm." Additionally, the answer prompts the social worker to reflect on how their personal beliefs may impact their work and explore strategies to manage biases, which is crucial for maintaining objectivity in mental health treatment.

However, to improve the answer, it could be more specific in outlining potential strategies for managing biases, such as undergoing cultural competence training or seeking supervision from someone with expertise in working with LGBTQ+ clients. Providing concrete steps for self-reflection and bias management would enhance the practicality of the response and better equip the social worker to navigate the ethical dilemma effectively.
