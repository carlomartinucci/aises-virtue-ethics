The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being and integrity of the athletes involved in the doping program. By choosing to stop administering performance-enhancing drugs, refusing to continue the unethical practice, and reporting the program to authorities, the individual is taking a stand against harmful actions that jeopardize the athletes' health. Seeking support for affected athletes and advocating for transparency and accountability in the sports community are positive steps towards rectifying the situation and preventing similar abuses in the future.

However, the answer could be further improved by addressing the need for personal accountability and acknowledging any potential legal consequences for being complicit in the doping program. Taking responsibility for one's actions and actively seeking ways to make amends or provide restitution to the athletes who have suffered due to the doping program would demonstrate a deeper commitment to ethical behavior. Additionally, outlining specific steps to ensure the athletes receive proper medical care and support in dealing with the physical and emotional consequences of the doping would enhance the practicality of the response.
