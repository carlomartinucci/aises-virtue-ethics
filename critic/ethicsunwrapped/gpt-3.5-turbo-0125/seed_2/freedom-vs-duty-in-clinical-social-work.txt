The suggested course of action is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being of the client and seeks guidance to ensure the client receives appropriate care. By recommending consultation with a supervisor or ethics committee, the social worker is taking a proactive step to address the conflict between their personal beliefs and professional responsibilities. This approach acknowledges the importance of maintaining objectivity and providing unbiased treatment to the client.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific strategies for the social worker to manage their biases effectively. For example, the social worker could engage in self-reflection exercises, attend cultural competency training, or seek supervision specifically focused on addressing personal biases. These actionable steps would help the social worker navigate the ethical dilemma more effectively and enhance their ability to provide quality care to the client.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the ethical considerations involved in the scenario and offers a practical solution. By incorporating more specific strategies for managing biases, the social worker can further enhance their professional practice and ensure the client's needs are met appropriately.
