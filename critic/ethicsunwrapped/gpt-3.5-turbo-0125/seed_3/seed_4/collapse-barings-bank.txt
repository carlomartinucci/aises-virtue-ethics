The answer provided is a fair evaluation of the situation. It emphasizes the importance of implementing proper risk management procedures, monitoring trading activities, setting up clear reporting mechanisms, establishing checks and balances, fostering a culture of transparency and open communication, and conducting regular audits and reviews. These actions are practical and actionable steps that could help prevent a situation like the collapse of Barings Bank from happening again.

Including measures to hold individuals accountable for their actions and ensuring that there are severe consequences for fraudulent activities would further strengthen the ethical framework within the organization.
