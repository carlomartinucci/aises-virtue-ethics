The answer provided is a good starting point in addressing the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. It demonstrates self-awareness and a willingness to seek guidance from a supervisor or colleague, which is commendable. By acknowledging the potential impact of personal beliefs on the therapeutic relationship and considering the client's best interests, the social worker is showing a commitment to ethical practice.

However, the response could be improved by providing more concrete steps on how to navigate the situation. For example, the social worker could explore ways to separate personal beliefs from professional responsibilities during therapy sessions, such as focusing on the client's needs and goals rather than imposing personal views. Additionally, the social worker could discuss the situation openly with the client to ensure transparency and address any concerns the client may have about potential biases.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the ethical considerations at play in the scenario. By implementing more specific strategies for managing personal biases and maintaining the therapeutic relationship, the social worker can ensure that the client receives the best possible care in line with professional ethical standards.
