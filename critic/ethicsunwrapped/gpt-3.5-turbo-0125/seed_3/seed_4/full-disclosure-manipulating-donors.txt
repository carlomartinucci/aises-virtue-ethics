Your answer is specific and actionable, which is good. You correctly identified the issue of miscommunication and suggested a course of action to address it internally with Mary. By proposing to clarify misconceptions to donors and discussing strategies for effective communication, you are aiming to uphold transparency and integrity in fundraising efforts, which is commendable.

However, a potential downside is that your response focuses mainly on internal actions and does not address the immediate issue of the inaccurate donation. While addressing the miscommunication internally is crucial for long-term integrity, it might also be necessary to consider reaching out to Robert to clarify the situation and potentially return the donation if he was misled. This would ensure ethical fundraising practices are upheld both internally and externally.

To improve your response, consider including a plan for rectifying the immediate situation with Robert while still emphasizing the importance of internal communication and transparency moving forward. This more comprehensive approach would address both the short-term and long-term ethical considerations in this scenario.
