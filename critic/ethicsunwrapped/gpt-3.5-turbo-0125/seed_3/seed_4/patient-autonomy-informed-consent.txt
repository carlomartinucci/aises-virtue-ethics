The answer provided is a well-considered and practical approach to the ethical dilemma presented in the case. 

Positively, convening a meeting with hospital staff to discuss concerns and emphasize ethical standards is a proactive step that fosters collaboration and open communication within the care team. Seeking guidance from the hospital's ethics committee demonstrates a commitment to ethical decision-making and a willingness to engage with experts in the field of bioethics to ensure the best course of action is taken.

Additionally, initiating a discussion with the patient's son, who serves as the guardian, to explore alternative options for drug administration shows a respect for the son's role while also considering the patient's values and goals. This approach prioritizes transparency and inclusivity in decision-making, which is crucial in complex ethical situations.

However, it would be beneficial to further emphasize the importance of the patient's best interests and well-being in the decision-making process. The focus should always center on providing the highest quality of care while respecting the autonomy and dignity of the patient, even in cases where guardians are involved. 

Overall, the response provides a structured and actionable plan that balances the various ethical considerations at play in the scenario. By continuing to prioritize the patient's needs and involving all relevant stakeholders in the decision-making process, a more comprehensive and ethically sound solution can be achieved.
