Your answer is clear and specific in addressing the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. You prioritize respecting the family's privacy and avoiding reporting on the graphic details of Robin Williams's suicide. This shows a commendable consideration for the potential harm such information could cause, especially in influencing vulnerable individuals. Additionally, your focus on highlighting Williams's struggles with mental health and his advocacy for open conversations about mental illness is a positive approach to raising awareness and reducing stigma.

However, while your response is ethically sound in terms of prioritizing privacy and sensitivity, you could strengthen it further by suggesting alternative ways to report on the story that would still inform the public without divulging graphic details. This could involve focusing on Williams's legacy, contributions to the entertainment industry, and his advocacy for mental health awareness. Providing concrete suggestions on how to balance the public's right to information with the family's need for privacy would enhance the actionable aspect of your response.
