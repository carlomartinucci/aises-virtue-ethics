The answer provided is a good starting point for addressing the ethical issues that arose in the scenario involving Nick Leeson and the collapse of Barings Bank. By advocating for proper risk management procedures, regular monitoring, clear reporting mechanisms, checks and balances, transparency, open communication, and regular audits, the response emphasizes the importance of creating a robust system to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

However, the answer lacks specificity in terms of how exactly these procedures would be implemented and enforced. It would have been more effective if the response had included concrete steps such as specific risk management frameworks to be adopted, details on how oversight and monitoring would be structured, examples of reporting mechanisms, and strategies for fostering a culture of transparency and open communication within the organization.

To improve the response, it would be beneficial to provide more actionable and detailed measures for implementing the proposed risk management procedures, monitoring mechanisms, reporting structures, checks and balances, and cultural initiatives. This would ensure a more comprehensive and practical approach to addressing the ethical issues highlighted in the scenario.
