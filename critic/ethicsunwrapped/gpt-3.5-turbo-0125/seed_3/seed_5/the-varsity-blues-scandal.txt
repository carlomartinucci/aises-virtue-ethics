The answer provided is ethical as it advocates for reporting illegal activities to the appropriate authorities, cooperating with investigations, and upholding the integrity of the college admissions process. By taking immediate action to report the fraudulent schemes and assist in the investigation, it aligns with ethical principles of accountability and justice.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting additional steps to mitigate the harm caused by the scandal. For instance, advocating for reforms in the college admissions process to prevent similar incidents in the future would be a proactive approach. Encouraging educational institutions to implement more transparent and fair admissions criteria could help restore trust in the system and ensure equal opportunities for all students.

Overall, the answer is ethical in its call for reporting misconduct and cooperating with authorities, but it could be enhanced by including concrete actions to address the underlying issues and prevent future occurrences of such unethical behavior.
