By organizing public forums and including experts from various fields, the answer promotes constructive conversation and a multidisciplinary approach to address the conflicting views on bullfighting.

Positively, the answer acknowledges the need for a nuanced understanding of the issue and the importance of mutual respect in engaging with differing perspectives.

However, a potential limitation is the lack of a clear stance or action plan to address the ethical implications of bullfighting. While promoting dialogue is valuable, it may not directly address the core issue of animal welfare and the ethical considerations surrounding the practice of bullfighting.

To improve the response, it could benefit from proposing concrete steps or recommendations for potential solutions or alternative approaches that balance cultural traditions with animal welfare concerns. This would provide a more actionable and practical approach to addressing the ethical dilemmas associated with bullfighting, moving beyond dialogue towards tangible outcomes and potential resolution.
