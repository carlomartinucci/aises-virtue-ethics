The answer provided is specific and actionable in addressing the issue of academic fraud at UNC involving student-athletes and the AFAM department. By working closely with the university administration, reviewing evidence, conducting interviews with relevant individuals, and supporting efforts to implement stricter oversight and accountability measures, the response demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing the problem.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on conducting thorough investigations and collaborating with other committee members to address the issue effectively. Additionally, the suggestion to establish clearer guidelines for course enrollment, enhance faculty supervision of independent study courses, and conduct regular audits shows a commitment to preventing future instances of academic fraud.
