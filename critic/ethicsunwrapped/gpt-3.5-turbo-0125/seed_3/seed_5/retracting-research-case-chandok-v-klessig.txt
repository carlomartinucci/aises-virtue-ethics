By ensuring all co-authors are fully informed of the legal proceedings and the court's ruling, potential misunderstandings and concerns can be addressed effectively.

It would be beneficial to incorporate a plan for facilitating discussions among the co-authors about lessons learned from the situation and how they can collectively improve practices for future research projects. Encouraging accountability and fostering a culture of transparency and integrity within the research team would further enhance the ethical response to the scenario.
