The answer provided is ethical in that it acknowledges the social worker's potential biases and seeks consultation to address the ethical dilemma. By recognizing the conflict between personal beliefs and professional duties, the social worker demonstrates a commitment to the well-being of the client. Seeking guidance from a supervisor or colleague is a proactive step to ensure that the client's needs are met effectively.

However, the answer lacks specificity in terms of exploring concrete strategies to set aside personal beliefs and provide nonjudgmental therapy. It would be beneficial to mention techniques such as self-reflection, cultural competence training, and seeking supervision to navigate challenging situations effectively. Additionally, discussing potential implications for the therapeutic relationship and exploring ways to maintain boundaries while transitioning the client to another therapist could enhance the response.

Overall, the answer shows a good foundation in ethical decision-making by acknowledging personal biases and seeking guidance. To improve, it could benefit from more specific strategies and considerations for navigating the ethical dilemma in a practical and actionable way.
