The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on supporting Albert Snyder's mental health and well-being in the face of the distress caused by the actions of the Westboro Baptist Church. By suggesting seeking help from mental health professionals and engaging with support groups, it acknowledges the importance of addressing emotional distress and seeking comfort from others who have faced similar challenges.

However, the answer could be improved by also recommending legal avenues for seeking justice or closure, such as exploring further legal options or advocacy groups that specialize in cases of emotional distress caused by harassment or defamation. Providing a more comprehensive range of options, including both mental health support and legal guidance, would offer a more well-rounded approach to addressing the situation.

Overall, the answer is practical and actionable in its focus on mental health support, but it could be enhanced by including additional suggestions for seeking legal recourse or advocacy.
