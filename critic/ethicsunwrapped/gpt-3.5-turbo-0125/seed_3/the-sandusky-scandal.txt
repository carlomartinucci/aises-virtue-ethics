The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of reporting the incident to the authorities, ensuring the victim receives support and protection, and cooperating with law enforcement to prevent further harm. By taking immediate action and not keeping the information quiet, the response aligns with ethical principles of prioritizing the well-being of the victim and promoting justice.

However, the evaluation could be improved by including specific steps on how to support the victim, such as offering counseling services or connecting them with appropriate resources. Additionally, it would be beneficial to mention the importance of holding the perpetrator accountable through legal channels and acknowledging the systemic failures that allowed the abuse to continue unchecked for so long. By addressing these aspects, the response would provide a more comprehensive and actionable ethical approach to the situation.
