The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of taking immediate action, reporting the incident to the authorities, ensuring the victim's safety and well-being, cooperating with law enforcement, and preventing further harm to potential victims. By doing so, it aligns with ethical principles of prioritizing the protection of vulnerable individuals and promoting justice.

However, the answer could be further improved by mentioning the importance of following institutional reporting protocols, seeking guidance from legal experts or counselors on how to handle such situations, and advocating for systemic changes to prevent similar incidents in the future. Additionally, acknowledging the responsibility to hold perpetrators and enablers accountable for their actions would strengthen the ethical stance of the response.
