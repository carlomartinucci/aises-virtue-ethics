The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it promotes academic integrity and fairness in the assessment process. Refusing to change students' answers on standardized tests and seeking alternative strategies to support students is commendable. Reporting suspicions of cheating to the appropriate authorities is also crucial for upholding educational standards.

On the positive side, by refusing to engage in cheating, the answer demonstrates a commitment to ethical conduct and maintaining the integrity of the assessment process. Seeking alternative ways to support students shows a dedication to helping them succeed through legitimate means.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific details on the alternative strategies that could have been implemented to support students. For instance, outlining a comprehensive plan for extra tutoring, study resources, and targeted interventions tailored to individual student needs would have made the response more actionable and practical.

Overall, while the answer aligns with ethical principles by rejecting cheating and advocating for fair assessment practices, it could benefit from a more detailed and actionable approach to supporting students in achieving academic success through legitimate means.
