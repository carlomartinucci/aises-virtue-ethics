The answer provided is ethical as it demonstrates a thoughtful approach to addressing the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. The social worker acknowledges their own religious beliefs and potential biases, showing self-awareness of how these could affect their ability to provide unbiased treatment. Consulting with a supervisor or colleague to seek guidance is a proactive step in navigating the situation effectively. Exploring the possibility of setting aside personal beliefs to provide nonjudgmental therapy shows a commitment to the client's well-being.

On the positive side, the social worker's willingness to consider transferring the client to another therapist if their beliefs are likely to interfere with the therapeutic relationship prioritizes the client's needs above their own personal convictions. This decision reflects a commitment to ethical principles and the client's right to receive effective and unbiased mental health services.

However, a potential improvement could be to proactively address how the social worker will support the client during the transition to another therapist. This could involve ensuring a smooth handover process and providing the client with appropriate resources and support to continue their therapy effectively. Additionally, discussing boundaries and limitations related to personal beliefs within the therapeutic setting could help prevent similar ethical dilemmas in the future.

Overall, the response demonstrates a sound ethical decision-making process, emphasizing the importance of maintaining professional boundaries and prioritizing the client's well-being. By taking proactive steps to address the ethical dilemma, the social worker shows a commitment to upholding the values and ethical standards of the social work profession.
