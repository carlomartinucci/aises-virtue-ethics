The response provided offers a practical and actionable approach to addressing the potential negative consequences of green consumer behavior. By educating consumers, encouraging reflection, promoting balanced consumption, offering alternatives, and monitoring and evaluating the impact of these efforts, the answer tackles the issue from multiple angles. 

The emphasis on raising awareness, fostering self-reflection, and providing alternative avenues for ethical expression is commendable. These actions have the potential to empower consumers to make more conscious decisions and avoid falling into the trap of moral licensing.

However, the response could benefit from more specific strategies on how to implement these actions effectively. For instance, detailing the channels through which consumer education will be delivered, outlining methods for encouraging reflection, and providing concrete examples of alternative ethical practices would enhance the overall effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Overall, the response provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical implications of green consumer behavior, but additional specificity in implementation strategies would further strengthen the plan.
