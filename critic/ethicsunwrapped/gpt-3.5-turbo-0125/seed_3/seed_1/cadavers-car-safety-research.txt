The answer provided is specific and actionable in addressing the issue at hand. By suggesting a thorough investigation into the research practices at Heidelberg University and Wayne State University, the responder aims to determine if proper ethical guidelines were followed. This includes reviewing consent procedures, examining methodologies used in the crash tests, and assessing the validity of the data obtained. Engaging with experts in bioethics to evaluate the ethical implications and seek recommendations is a proactive step towards upholding ethical standards while advancing scientific knowledge in car safety.

Positive aspects of the answer include the emphasis on investigation and evaluation of the research practices, as well as the consideration of seeking expert advice in bioethics. These actions demonstrate a commitment to ensuring ethical standards are upheld and that the research is conducted responsibly.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of immediate action or stance on the ethical concerns raised by various groups and individuals. While the proposed investigation is a critical step, addressing the ethical implications more directly in the response could have added clarity on the stance towards the controversial use of human cadavers in crash tests.

Overall, the answer is practical and specific in its proposed actions, focusing on investigating the research practices and seeking expert guidance in bioethics. To enhance the response further, it could include a more explicit acknowledgment of the ethical concerns raised and a commitment to addressing them in a transparent and accountable manner.
