The answer provided is ethical as it addresses the need for proper risk management procedures, oversight, transparency, and communication within the organization to prevent a situation like the Barings Bank collapse from happening again. It emphasizes the importance of clear reporting mechanisms, checks and balances, and a culture that encourages open communication and reporting of issues. The suggestion of regular audits and reviews to detect irregularities early on is also crucial in maintaining the integrity of the organization.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific details on how these risk management procedures and oversight mechanisms would be implemented. For example, outlining specific steps to be taken in terms of setting up reporting structures, conducting audits, and enforcing accountability measures would make the response more actionable and practical. Additionally, addressing the role of training and education for employees on risk management practices could further enhance the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Overall, while the answer is on the right track in terms of addressing the ethical considerations, it could benefit from more specific and detailed action steps for implementation.
