The answer provided is fair and practical. It addresses the issue of miscommunication with a donor and suggests a concrete course of action to address it. By proposing to have a private conversation with Mary to express concerns and suggest ways to ensure transparency with donors, the answer demonstrates a proactive approach to maintaining integrity in fundraising efforts. It also emphasizes the importance of clarifying misconceptions to donors, which is crucial for maintaining ethical standards in fundraising practices.

However, the answer could be improved by specifying potential strategies to effectively communicate with donors and prevent similar misunderstandings in the future. Providing specific examples or steps to take during donor interactions would enhance the practicality of the response and make it more actionable. Additionally, considering discussing potential training or guidelines for staff on how to handle such situations could further strengthen the proposed solution.
