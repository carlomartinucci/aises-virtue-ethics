The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on implementing proper risk management procedures, establishing clear reporting mechanisms, checks and balances, promoting transparency and open communication, and conducting regular audits and reviews. These actions would indeed help prevent situations like the collapse of Barings Bank due to unchecked risky trading activities. By emphasizing the importance of oversight, communication, and early detection of irregularities, the answer addresses the core issues that led to the downfall of the bank.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific details on how exactly these risk management procedures would be implemented. For instance, outlining specific steps for monitoring trading activities, detailing the structure of reporting mechanisms, and explaining how the culture of transparency would be fostered within the organization would make the response more actionable and practical. Additionally, addressing the need for consequences for individuals who engage in deceptive practices would further strengthen the ethical stance of the answer.
