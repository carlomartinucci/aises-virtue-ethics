Your answer is ethical as it prioritizes respecting the family's privacy during a difficult time and acknowledges the potential harm that detailed reporting on suicide methods can cause. By focusing on the broader issues of mental health awareness and reducing stigma, you are taking a sensitive and responsible approach to reporting the story. This demonstrates a consideration for the well-being of both the family and the broader community affected by the news.

To improve your response, you could also mention the importance of following established guidelines on reporting on suicides, such as those from the Press Complaints Commission, which recommend avoiding excessive detail about the method used. By referencing such guidelines explicitly, you would be providing a clear framework for ethical reporting in similar situations. Additionally, highlighting the need for empathy and sensitivity in journalism when dealing with sensitive topics like suicide would further strengthen your answer.
