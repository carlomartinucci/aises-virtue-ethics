The answer provided is ethical as it aims to raise awareness about the issues of false confessions, wrongful convictions, and racial bias in the criminal justice system. By sharing the story of the Central Park 5 widely and accurately, advocating for reforms in police interrogation practices, and legal procedures, it addresses the systemic injustices that led to the wrongful conviction of these young men.

Advocating for reforms is crucial to prevent similar miscarriages of justice from happening in the future.

Additionally, incorporating strategies to support the exonerees and address the lasting impact of their wrongful convictions would enhance the overall effectiveness of the proposed actions.
