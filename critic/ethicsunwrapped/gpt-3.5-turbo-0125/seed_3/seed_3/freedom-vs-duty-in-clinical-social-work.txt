The answer provided is a practical and specific approach to handling the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. By acknowledging personal beliefs and biases, seeking guidance from a supervisor or colleague, and considering the impact on the client's therapy, the social worker demonstrates a willingness to address the conflict professionally. Consulting with others and exploring the possibility of setting aside personal beliefs for the client's benefit are positive actions that prioritize the client's well-being. The decision to transfer the client to another therapist if personal beliefs may interfere with treatment shows a commitment to providing quality care.

However, a potential improvement could be to emphasize the importance of ongoing self-reflection and continuous efforts to remain aware of personal biases that may affect the therapeutic relationship. Additionally, the social worker could consider discussing the situation openly and honestly with the client, explaining the reasons for the potential transfer to ensure transparency and maintain trust.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and actionable response to the ethical dilemma, highlighting the need for self-awareness, consultation with colleagues, and prioritizing the client's best interests.
