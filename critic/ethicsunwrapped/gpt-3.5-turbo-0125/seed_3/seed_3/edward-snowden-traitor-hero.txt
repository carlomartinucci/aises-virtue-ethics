By acknowledging the complexity of the matter and considering the potential impacts on national security and the public interest, the response demonstrates a holistic perspective. Consulting with various experts and stakeholders to gather diverse viewpoints is a commendable step towards making an informed decision.

However, the evaluation could be enhanced by providing more specific details on how the analysis would be conducted and what criteria would be used to determine whether Snowden's actions were in the public interest. Additionally, a clearer stance on whether Snowden should be prosecuted or not, based on the analysis, would strengthen the response.
