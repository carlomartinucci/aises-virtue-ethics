The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of reporting the incident to the authorities, ensuring the victim receives support and protection, and cooperating fully with law enforcement to prevent further harm. By taking immediate action and prioritizing the well-being of the victim, the response aligns with ethical principles of accountability and justice.

However, the response lacks specificity in terms of outlining concrete steps that could have been taken beyond reporting the incident. For a more actionable approach, the answer could have included suggestions such as offering counseling or support services to the victim, advocating for policy changes within the institution to prevent similar incidents, and actively engaging in efforts to raise awareness about child abuse and prevention.

In conclusion, while the answer demonstrates a commitment to ethical behavior by advocating for reporting the incident and supporting the victim, it could be further enhanced by providing specific actions that could have been taken to address the situation comprehensively and prevent future occurrences.
