The answer provided is ethical as it proposes concrete steps to address the concerns raised by the public and various organizations regarding the use of human cadavers in car crash tests. By suggesting a thorough investigation into the research practices at the universities involved, reviewing consent procedures, examining methodologies, and seeking input from experts in bioethics, the answer aims to ensure that ethical guidelines are followed and that the research is conducted in a responsible manner.

The positive aspects of this response include the proactive approach of initiating an investigation to evaluate the ethical implications of the research practices. By engaging with experts in bioethics, there is an emphasis on seeking outside perspectives to guide decision-making and ensure that ethical standards are upheld.

However, a potential limitation of this response is the lack of immediate action to halt the controversial research pending the investigation. While it is important to gather information and consult experts, there may be an argument for taking more decisive steps in response to the public outcry and concerns raised by ethical organizations. Additionally, the answer could have outlined specific actions that would be taken based on the findings of the investigation to address any ethical violations or gaps in research practices.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a commitment to addressing ethical concerns through investigation and consultation with experts, but could benefit from a more assertive stance in addressing the immediate ethical issues at hand.
