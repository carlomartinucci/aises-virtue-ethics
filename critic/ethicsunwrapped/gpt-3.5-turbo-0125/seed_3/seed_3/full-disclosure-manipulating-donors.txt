The answer provided is ethical as it addresses the issue of miscommunication with a donor and emphasizes the importance of transparency and integrity in fundraising efforts. By suggesting a private conversation with Mary to express concerns and proposing strategies to avoid similar misunderstandings in the future, the response shows a commitment to maintaining ethical standards in handling donor relations.

However, one area for improvement could be to include specific examples of how to clarify the organization's mission and the population it serves to donors. Providing concrete suggestions on how to address misperceptions directly with donors could enhance the practicality of the proposed solution. Additionally, offering ideas on how to educate staff members on handling such situations effectively could further strengthen the response.
