The answer provided is ethical as it demonstrates a thoughtful and reflective approach to the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. By acknowledging personal beliefs and potential biases that could impact the client's treatment, seeking guidance from a supervisor or colleague, and considering the best interest of the client, the social worker is taking steps to address the conflict between their religious beliefs and professional responsibilities.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on self-awareness and seeking guidance from others. By recognizing the potential for personal biases to interfere with the therapeutic relationship, the social worker is demonstrating a commitment to ethical practice and the well-being of the client. Consulting with a supervisor or colleague shows a willingness to engage in ethical decision-making and seek support when facing challenging situations.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of a clear plan for addressing the situation if personal beliefs do indeed interfere with the ability to provide unbiased treatment. While transitioning the client to another therapist may be a valid solution, more concrete steps could be outlined to ensure a smooth and ethical transition for the client.

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. To enhance the response, the social worker could consider developing a more detailed plan for managing personal biases and ensuring the client's needs are met effectively and ethically.
