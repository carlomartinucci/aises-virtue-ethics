The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it focuses on supporting Albert Snyder's mental health and well-being in the face of the emotional distress caused by the actions of the Westboro Baptist Church. Encouraging him to seek help from mental health professionals and connect with support groups shows a genuine concern for his healing process and resilience.

However, the answer could be improved by also suggesting legal avenues for seeking justice or closure, such as exploring further legal options or advocacy for legislative changes to prevent similar incidents in the future. While mental health support is crucial, addressing the underlying issue of the harm caused by organizations like the Westboro Baptist Church is also important in achieving a more comprehensive resolution.

Overall, the answer provides a compassionate and practical approach to supporting Albert Snyder, but could benefit from a more holistic approach that includes both mental health support and potential legal or advocacy actions to address the root cause of his distress.
