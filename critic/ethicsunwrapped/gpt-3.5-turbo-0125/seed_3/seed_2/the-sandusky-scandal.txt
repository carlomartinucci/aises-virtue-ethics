The answer to the scenario question is indeed ethical. By immediately reporting the incident to the authorities, ensuring the victim's safety and support, and cooperating with law enforcement, the individual is taking the right steps to address the serious issue of child sexual abuse. This response shows a commitment to prioritizing the well-being of the victim, seeking justice, and preventing further harm.

However, it would have been beneficial to also mention the importance of following up with the authorities to ensure that appropriate actions were taken, and to advocate for policies and procedures within the institution to prevent similar incidents in the future. Additionally, acknowledging the ethical responsibility to report such incidents promptly and not keeping the information quiet would further enhance the ethical evaluation.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a strong ethical stance in addressing the situation involving child sexual abuse, but could be improved by including a more comprehensive approach to accountability and prevention within the institutional context.
