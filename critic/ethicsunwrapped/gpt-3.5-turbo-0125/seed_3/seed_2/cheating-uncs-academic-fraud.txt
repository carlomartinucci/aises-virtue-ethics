The answer provided is specific, practical, and actionable in addressing the issue of academic fraud at UNC involving student-athletes and the AFAM department. By working closely with the university administration, investigating the specific cases, and reviewing evidence, the response demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing the problem. Additionally, advocating for stricter academic oversight, clearer guidelines, and increased transparency shows a commitment to preventing future instances of fraud and promoting academic integrity.

However, the response could benefit from further emphasis on the importance of accountability and consequences for those involved in the fraud scheme. While implementing reforms and promoting transparency are essential steps, holding individuals responsible for their actions is crucial to upholding academic standards and restoring trust in the university's academic programs.
