The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing the issue of cheating in Paralympic sports. By suggesting collaboration with relevant authorities to strengthen the classification system and ensure its integrity, implementing stricter protocols, conducting thorough evaluations, increasing oversight, and supporting educational initiatives like the online course launched by Australia, the response offers actionable steps to address the problem. Additionally, advocating for harsh penalties for cheaters to deter misconduct shows a commitment to upholding the integrity of Paralympic competition.

However, the response could benefit from a more detailed plan on how to specifically improve the classification system. Providing concrete suggestions on what specific protocols could be implemented, how evaluations could be enhanced, and what additional monitoring measures could be put in place would make the answer even more actionable. Furthermore, considering the global nature of the issue, exploring ways to promote international collaboration and standardization in classification practices could also strengthen the proposed actions.
