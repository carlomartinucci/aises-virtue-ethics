The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it aims to raise awareness and educate the public on the importance of addressing climate change from an ethical perspective. By emphasizing the global, intergenerational, and philosophical dilemmas of climate change, the proposed action seeks to encourage individuals to reflect on their roles and responsibilities in mitigating the issue.

One positive aspect of this approach is that increased public awareness and education can indeed lead to a better understanding of the ethical complexities surrounding climate change. It has the potential to mobilize public support for ambitious climate action and may influence societal norms towards more sustainable practices and policies.

However, a potential drawback of this approach is that while raising awareness is important, it may not directly address the systemic challenges and barriers that prevent more significant climate action. Without concrete measures to hold governments and corporations accountable for their commitments under the Paris Agreement, or to address the underlying economic and political factors that hinder progress, the impact of awareness campaigns alone may be limited.

To enhance the effectiveness of this approach, it would be beneficial to complement educational efforts with advocacy for stronger policies, regulations, and international cooperation to ensure that the goals of the Paris Agreement are met. This could involve engaging with policymakers, supporting grassroots movements, and promoting sustainable practices at both individual and institutional levels. By combining educational initiatives with concrete actions to drive change, the proposed approach can have a more substantial and lasting impact in the fight against climate change.
