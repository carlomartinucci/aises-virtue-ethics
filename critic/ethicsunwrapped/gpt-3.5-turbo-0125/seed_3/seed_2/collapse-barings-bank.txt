The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on implementing proper risk management procedures, monitoring trading activities, promoting transparency, and establishing a culture of open communication within the organization. By setting up clear reporting mechanisms, checks and balances, and conducting regular audits, the organization can detect and address issues like the one that led to the downfall of Barings Bank.

The strengths of this response lie in its practical approach to preventing similar incidents in the future by addressing the root causes of the problem through improved oversight and communication. By implementing these measures, the organization can better protect itself from individual actions that could have catastrophic consequences.

However, a potential weakness is the lack of emphasis on individual accountability and consequences for unethical behavior. While implementing procedures and checks is important, it is equally crucial to hold individuals responsible for their actions and ensure that there are repercussions for unethical conduct. Including measures for accountability and consequences in addition to the proposed risk management procedures would further strengthen the organization's ethical framework.
