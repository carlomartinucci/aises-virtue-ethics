The answer provided is ethical as it involves taking immediate action to report the information about sexual assaults and cover-ups to the appropriate university officials. By doing so, the victims can receive the necessary support and protection they deserve. Additionally, providing evidence such as the exchanged messages between Briles and McCaw can assist in the investigation and response to the situation.

The proactive approach of reporting the wrongdoing and cooperating with the university officials is commendable as it prioritizes the well-being and safety of the victims. By not remaining silent and bringing the issue to light, it helps in addressing the misconduct and holding those responsible accountable.

However, one aspect that could be improved upon is the suggestion to also report the information to external authorities, such as law enforcement, to ensure a comprehensive investigation and legal actions if necessary. While reporting to university officials is crucial, involving external authorities can provide an additional layer of oversight and ensure a thorough examination of the situation.

Overall, the provided response is actionable and ethical, emphasizing the importance of taking immediate steps to address the serious misconduct and protect the victims involved.
