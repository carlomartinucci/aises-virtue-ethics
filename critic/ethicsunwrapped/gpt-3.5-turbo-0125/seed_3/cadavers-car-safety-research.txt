The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it advocates for a thorough investigation into the research practices at Heidelberg University and Wayne State University to ensure that proper ethical guidelines were followed. By reviewing consent procedures, methodologies, and data validity, the response aims to address the concerns raised by various groups and political leaders regarding the use of human cadavers in crash tests.

The good in this response lies in its proactive approach to investigating the situation and seeking expert advice in bioethics. By engaging with experts, there is a potential for gaining valuable insights on how to navigate the ethical complexities of using human cadavers in research while still advancing scientific knowledge in car safety.

However, the response could be improved by specifying concrete actions that would be taken based on the investigation's findings. For example, outlining steps to rectify any ethical breaches discovered, implementing stricter guidelines for future research involving human subjects, and ensuring transparency in the research process would enhance the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed solution.

Overall, the response demonstrates a commitment to addressing the ethical concerns raised by the controversial research practices, but it could benefit from a more detailed plan of action to ensure accountability and adherence to ethical standards in the future.
