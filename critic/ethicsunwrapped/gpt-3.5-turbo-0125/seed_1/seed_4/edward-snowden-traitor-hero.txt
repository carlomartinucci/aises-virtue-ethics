The answer provided presents a practical approach to addressing the complexity of Edward Snowden's actions by suggesting a thorough evaluation of the leaked documents by a panel of experts. This approach acknowledges the need to consider both the potential harm caused by the disclosure and the public interest served by the information being made known. By examining the implications on privacy rights and national security, the answer attempts to balance the ethical considerations involved.

One positive aspect of this response is the focus on gathering specific information to make a more informed decision regarding Snowden's actions. By involving legal and ethical experts in the evaluation process, a more nuanced understanding of the situation can be achieved, aiding in determining the ethical and legal implications.

However, a potential limitation of this approach is the lack of a clear stance on the ethical evaluation of Snowden's actions. While the suggestion to convene a panel of experts is actionable, it does not explicitly provide a definitive ethical judgment on Snowden's whistleblowing. This ambiguity may hinder the ability to reach a conclusive decision on the matter.

Overall, the answer offers a practical step forward in addressing the ethical and legal complexities surrounding Edward Snowden's actions by proposing a detailed evaluation process. To enhance this response, it would be beneficial to include a more explicit ethical stance on the whistleblowing act itself, thus providing a clearer direction for potential decisions on accountability.
