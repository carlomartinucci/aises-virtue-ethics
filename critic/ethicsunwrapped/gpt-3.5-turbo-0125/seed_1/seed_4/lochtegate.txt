The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it addresses the need for a thorough investigation into the incident, gathering all available evidence, and taking appropriate actions based on the findings. It emphasizes the importance of accountability and making amends for the negative impact caused by Lochte's actions. The focus on providing support and guidance to Lochte as he deals with the aftermath is commendable.

However, the answer could be improved by being more specific about the steps to be taken during the investigation process. For example, detailing how witness statements will be collected, outlining a timeline for completing the investigation, and specifying how legal counsel will be involved in determining the appropriate course of action. Additionally, offering concrete suggestions for how Lochte can actively engage in making amends, such as engaging in outreach programs or public awareness campaigns, would enhance the overall effectiveness of the response.
