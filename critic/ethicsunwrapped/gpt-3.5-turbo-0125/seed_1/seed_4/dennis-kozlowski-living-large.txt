The answer provided is specific and actionable, demonstrating a clear plan of action to review and analyze the financial records and documentation of Tyco International during Dennis Kozlowski's tenure. By examining details of unauthorized bonuses, large purchases, investments, and financial transactions recorded in the company's official records, the answer aims to verify the accuracy of Kozlowski's statement and investigate the authorization processes in place within Tyco.

The strengths of this approach lie in its methodical and evidence-based methodology, focusing on concrete financial records to determine the validity of the allegations against Kozlowski. By conducting a thorough examination, the answer seeks to uncover the truth behind the accusations and clarify the legitimacy of the charges brought against him.

However, a potential weakness could be the narrow focus solely on verifying the accuracy of Kozlowski's statement and the company's financial records. While important, the answer could also benefit from considering broader ethical implications and addressing the underlying issues of corporate governance and accountability that allowed such misconduct to occur.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for investigating the financial misconduct allegations against Kozlowski but could be enhanced by incorporating a more comprehensive analysis of the ethical dimensions surrounding the case.
