The answer provided is a practical and actionable response to the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. By suggesting scheduling a consultation with a supervisor or experienced colleague, the social worker is actively seeking guidance on how to navigate the conflict between their religious beliefs and their ethical obligation to provide unbiased mental health treatment to the client. This demonstrates a willingness to address the issue and seek assistance in making a difficult decision.

Additionally, discussing the potential implications of transferring the client to another therapist and exploring alternative solutions shows a proactive approach to finding a resolution that upholds the client's best interests while also considering the social worker's personal beliefs. Ultimately, committing to follow the guidance provided during the consultation ensures that the client receives appropriate care and support, prioritizing the client's well-being above personal beliefs.

However, the evaluation could be improved by explicitly mentioning the importance of upholding the ethical principles outlined by the National Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics, particularly the duty to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation. Emphasizing the need to prioritize the client's rights and well-being while balancing personal beliefs would strengthen the ethical decision-making process in this scenario.
