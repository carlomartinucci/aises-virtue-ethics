This answer provides specific and actionable steps to address the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. By convening a meeting with hospital staff, encouraging open dialogue, and consulting with the hospital's ethics committee, the responder demonstrates a proactive approach to discussing and resolving the ethical concerns. The recommendation to explore alternative strategies and engage in shared decision-making with the patient's guardian also shows a commitment to respecting autonomy and seeking a solution that aligns with the patient's preferences.

However, the answer could benefit from further clarification on how to balance the competing interests involved in this situation. It would be helpful to provide more concrete suggestions on how to navigate the tension between the patient's autonomy and the need for treatment, particularly in cases where the patient has been deemed mentally incompetent. Additionally, addressing the discomfort of hospital staff about deceiving the patient could be more explicitly acknowledged and integrated into the proposed course of action.

Overall, the response offers a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to handling the ethical dilemma, emphasizing the importance of ethical reflection, consultation, and collaboration in decision-making processes. It could be strengthened by providing additional guidance on reconciling conflicting principles and addressing the emotional challenges faced by healthcare professionals in such complex situations.
