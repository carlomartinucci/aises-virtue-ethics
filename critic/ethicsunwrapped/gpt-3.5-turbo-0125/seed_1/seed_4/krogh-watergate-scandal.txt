The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of raising concerns about the legality and morality of the proposed operation, advocating for upholding the rule of law and ethical standards, and promoting the use of lawful methods to address the issue. By prioritizing ethical behavior and respect for the law, the response shows a commitment to integrity and accountability in government actions.

However, to improve the response, it could have included more specific actions that could have been taken in that situation. For example, suggesting consulting with legal advisors, requesting a formal legal opinion on the proposed operation, or proposing alternative strategies to address the leak while staying within legal boundaries. Providing concrete steps or strategies would have made the response more actionable and practical in guiding decision-making in such a challenging situation.
