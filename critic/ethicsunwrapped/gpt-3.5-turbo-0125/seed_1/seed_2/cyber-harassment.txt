The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on addressing the issue of cyberbullying in a constructive and proactive manner. By prioritizing the well-being and safety of the student who posted the hurtful messages, providing support and guidance, and organizing educational sessions on cyberbullying, online etiquette, and consequences of digital behavior, the response aims to prevent future incidents and promote positive online interactions.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on education and awareness-raising, both within the school community and among parents. By involving all stakeholders in addressing cyberbullying, the approach seeks to create a comprehensive strategy for prevention and intervention.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of specific details on the types of counseling or mediation that would be provided to the student, as well as the exact content of the educational sessions. Providing more concrete examples of intervention strategies and educational materials would enhance the effectiveness of the response.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for addressing cyberbullying in a school setting, but could benefit from more specific action steps and detailed implementation plans to ensure its success.
