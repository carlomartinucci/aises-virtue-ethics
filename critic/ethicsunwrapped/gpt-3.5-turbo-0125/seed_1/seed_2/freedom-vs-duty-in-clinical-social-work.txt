The answer provided is ethical as it suggests seeking guidance from a supervisor or colleague experienced in ethical decision-making in social work practice. This demonstrates a willingness to address the conflict between personal beliefs and professional obligations in a responsible manner. By discussing the implications of transferring the client and exploring alternative solutions, the social worker shows a commitment to upholding the client's best interests while also considering their own beliefs.

However, the answer could be improved by specifying the steps that would be taken during the consultation with the supervisor or colleague. For example, discussing specific ethical principles or guidelines from the NASW Code of Ethics that could inform the decision-making process would provide a more concrete and actionable approach. Additionally, considering the potential impact on the client's therapeutic progress and exploring ways to address the client's concerns while remaining within ethical boundaries would further enhance the response.
