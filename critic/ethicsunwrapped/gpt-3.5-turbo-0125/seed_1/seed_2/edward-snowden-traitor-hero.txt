Your response offers a practical and actionable approach to addressing the complexity of Edward Snowden's actions. By suggesting the formation of a panel of legal and ethical experts to carefully analyze the leaked documents, you propose a methodical way to evaluate the situation. This approach allows for a thorough examination of the potential harm caused by Snowden's actions, as well as an assessment of whether the public interest was served. Furthermore, your suggestion to consider alternative, legal channels for reporting concerns within the government oversight framework demonstrates a balanced perspective.

On the positive side, your response emphasizes the importance of a detailed analysis and evaluation process involving experts from relevant fields. This methodical approach could lead to a more nuanced understanding of the ethical and legal implications of Snowden's actions.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of a clear recommendation or conclusion based on the evaluation process. While it is valuable to emphasize the need for careful consideration and analysis, a more definitive stance or course of action could enhance the practicality of your response.

Overall, your response provides a solid framework for evaluating the situation surrounding Edward Snowden's actions, but it could benefit from a more decisive recommendation at the end of the process.
