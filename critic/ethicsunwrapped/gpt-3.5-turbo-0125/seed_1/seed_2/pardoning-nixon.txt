The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it suggests addressing the concerns and suspicions of the public through transparency and open communication. By recommending a nationally televised press conference where President Ford can explain the reasons for pardoning Nixon, the answer acknowledges the importance of accountability and honesty in leadership.

However, the answer could be improved by including more concrete actions that President Ford could take to address the public outrage. For example, specific details about what President Ford would say in the press conference or how he would demonstrate his commitment to transparency could have been included. Additionally, the answer could have addressed the potential consequences of Ford's decision more directly, such as the impact on public trust and the perception of the presidency.

Overall, while the answer provides a general direction for addressing the situation, it could benefit from more specific and actionable steps to effectively address the ethical concerns raised by the scenario.
