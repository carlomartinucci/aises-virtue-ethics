The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of not engaging in illegal activities like hacking and instead encourages reporting concerns through proper channels within the organization. This approach promotes integrity and compliance with the law, which are essential in maintaining trust and upholding ethical standards in the workplace.

The answer is specific and actionable, offering a clear course of action to address the situation. By advising to report suspicions to appropriate authorities and provide evidence for investigation, it demonstrates a practical approach to dealing with potential intellectual property theft.

However, one area for improvement could be to also highlight the importance of documenting any concerns or suspicions raised, as well as following up on the reported issues to ensure they are properly addressed. This would further strengthen the response by emphasizing the need for accountability and transparency in handling such sensitive matters.

Overall, the answer provides a solid ethical framework for addressing concerns of intellectual property theft without resorting to illegal activities, and with some additional emphasis on documentation and follow-up, it could be even more comprehensive in its guidance.
