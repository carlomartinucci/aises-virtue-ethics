The answer provided is specific and actionable, offering practical steps to address the ethical concerns in the scenario. By convening a meeting with hospital staff to discuss the situation and encouraging open dialogue, the responder promotes transparency and ethical reflection within the care team. Additionally, seeking guidance from the hospital's ethics committee demonstrates a commitment to engaging with a diverse group of experts to navigate the complex ethical issues at hand.

However, the response could be improved by explicitly acknowledging the potential harm caused by deceiving the patient and the violation of his autonomy. It would be beneficial to emphasize the importance of considering the patient's best interests while also upholding ethical principles. Furthermore, the answer could be strengthened by proposing specific alternative strategies for medication administration that prioritize the patient's autonomy and well-being.

Overall, the response provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical dilemmas presented in the scenario, but it could be enhanced by incorporating a more explicit consideration of the patient's autonomy and exploring additional concrete solutions to uphold ethical principles in the patient's care.
