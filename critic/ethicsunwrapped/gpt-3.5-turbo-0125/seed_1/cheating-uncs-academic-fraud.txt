The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on implementing and monitoring the reforms put in place by UNC to address the academic fraud scandal. By working with university officials to ensure higher governance standards, accountability measures, and conducting regular audits, the response aims to prevent future instances of academic fraud. Collaborating with relevant departments to support student-athletes in their academic pursuits also demonstrates a commitment to providing a quality education while considering their athletic responsibilities.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific details on how exactly the reforms would be implemented and monitored. For instance, outlining a timeline for conducting audits, specifying the criteria for accountability measures, and detailing the support services that would be offered to student-athletes could enhance the effectiveness of the response. Additionally, addressing the need for transparency and communication with all stakeholders involved in the process would further strengthen the ethical approach to handling the situation.
