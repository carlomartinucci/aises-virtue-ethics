The answer provided is quite ethical as it advocates for engaging in dialogue, active listening, empathy, and validation of students' experiences. It emphasizes the importance of creating a safe and inclusive environment while also valuing free speech and promoting respectful conversations. By advocating for constructive dialogue and the consideration of diverse viewpoints, it encourages a balanced approach to addressing issues of social equality on campus.

What could be improved:
- It would be beneficial to suggest specific actions to bridge the gap between the protesters and the university administration, such as setting up facilitated discussions or creating safe spaces for open dialogue.
- Providing concrete examples of successful conflict resolution strategies or inclusivity initiatives from other institutions could offer practical guidance on how to address similar issues.
- Including recommendations on how to navigate situations where there are conflicting perspectives on free speech and social equality could help in finding common ground and fostering understanding among stakeholders. 

Overall, while the answer is ethical and emphasizes important principles, adding specific actions and examples would enhance its practicality and effectiveness in addressing the complex dynamics present in the scenario.
