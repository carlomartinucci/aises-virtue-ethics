The answer provided is ethical as it proposes conducting a thorough environmental impact assessment before proceeding with the offshore drilling project in the Arctic. By considering the potential effects on the local ecosystem, endangered species, and the risks associated with an oil spill in icy waters, the answer aims to make an informed decision based on scientific evidence.

Positively, conducting an environmental impact assessment shows a commitment to understanding the potential consequences of the drilling project on the environment and wildlife. By evaluating the risks and benefits, it ensures a more balanced decision-making process that takes into account both environmental concerns and economic interests.

However, the answer lacks specificity on how the assessment will be carried out and what actions will be taken based on its findings. It would be beneficial to outline a clear plan for how the assessment will be conducted, what criteria will be used to evaluate the risks, and how the results will inform the decision-making process.

To improve the answer, it should include specific details on the methodology of the environmental impact assessment, the experts involved, the timeline for completion, and how the findings will be used to determine the feasibility of the drilling project. Providing a more detailed and actionable plan would strengthen the ethical approach to addressing the competing views on offshore drilling in the Arctic.
