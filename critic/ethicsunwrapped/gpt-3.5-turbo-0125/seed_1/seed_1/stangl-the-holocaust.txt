The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on preserving historical records and educating future generations about the atrocities committed during the Holocaust. By collaborating with historians, researchers, and Holocaust memorials to document Stangl's crimes, the answer ensures that his role in the genocide is not forgotten, serving as a reminder of the consequences of individuals' actions in times of moral crisis.

However, while the answer addresses the importance of historical documentation and education, it lacks specific actions to address potential consequences. It could be strengthened by suggesting ways to ensure accountability, such as supporting ongoing justice efforts for victims and their families, advocating for continued research on genocide prevention, or promoting initiatives that combat denial and revisionism of historical events. Emphasizing these actionable steps would enhance the ethical response by showing a commitment to seeking justice and preventing similar atrocities in the future.
