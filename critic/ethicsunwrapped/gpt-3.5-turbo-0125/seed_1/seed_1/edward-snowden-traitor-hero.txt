Your answer provides a practical and specific approach to addressing the complexity of Edward Snowden's actions. By suggesting the formation of a panel of legal and ethical experts to analyze the leaked documents, you aim to evaluate the potential harm caused by the disclosures and assess whether the public interest was served. This approach acknowledges the need for a thorough examination of the situation before making any decisions regarding accountability.

One positive aspect of your suggestion is the emphasis on careful evaluation and analysis of the information involved. By involving a panel of experts, you aim to bring diverse perspectives to the table, which could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the ethical and legal implications of Snowden's actions.

However, one potential drawback is the lack of clarity on what actions would be taken after the analysis. While evaluating the content of the leaked documents is crucial, it would also be important to consider how the findings of the panel would be utilized in determining the appropriate response to Snowden's actions. Providing more specific recommendations on potential next steps based on the panel's assessment would enhance the actionable nature of your response.

Overall, your answer offers a pragmatic approach to addressing the ethical and legal complexities surrounding Snowden's whistleblowing, but further clarity on the course of action following the analysis would strengthen the evaluation.
