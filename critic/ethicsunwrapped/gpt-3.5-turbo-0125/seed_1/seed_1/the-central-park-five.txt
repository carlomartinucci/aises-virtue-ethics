By working to raise awareness about the case and the indisputable evidence of innocence, the response aims to shed light on the injustice and advocate for criminal justice reforms to prevent similar occurrences in the future. Engaging with media outlets, advocacy groups, politicians, and policymakers demonstrates a comprehensive strategy to seek accountability for those involved in the wrongful conviction.
