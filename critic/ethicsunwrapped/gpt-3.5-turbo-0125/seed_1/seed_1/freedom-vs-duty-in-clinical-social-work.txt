The answer provided is both specific and actionable. By suggesting scheduling a consultation with a supervisor or colleague experienced in ethical decision-making in social work practice, the social worker is taking a proactive step to address the ethical dilemma they are facing. Seeking guidance on how to navigate the conflict between their religious beliefs and their ethical obligation to provide unbiased mental health treatment to the client shows a willingness to engage in self-reflection and seek assistance in upholding professional standards.

However, the answer could benefit from further exploration of potential alternative solutions beyond transferring the client to another therapist. The social worker could consider discussing the issue openly and honestly with the client, while ensuring that the client's well-being and autonomy are prioritized. Exploring ways to separate personal beliefs from professional responsibilities and seeking additional training or supervision to enhance cultural competence and respect for diversity could also be beneficial.

Overall, the response demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing the ethical dilemma at hand, but could be further enhanced by considering a broader range of options to ensure the client's best interests are upheld while respecting the social worker's personal beliefs.
