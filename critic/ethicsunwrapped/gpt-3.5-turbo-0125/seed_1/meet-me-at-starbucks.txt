It includes specific steps such as conducting an investigation, providing training, meeting with the affected individuals, implementing a clear policy, engaging with the community, and taking responsibility publicly.

The strengths of this response lie in its specificity and practicality. The actions outlined are concrete and targeted towards addressing the root causes of the incident, such as bias and discrimination. By conducting a thorough investigation, providing training, and engaging with the community, the plan aims to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future and rebuild trust with the affected individuals and the community.

However, one potential weakness is the lack of immediate action to address the immediate harm caused to Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson.
