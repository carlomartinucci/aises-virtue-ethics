The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of reporting any new information or evidence of sexual assault involving football players to the appropriate university officials. This action is crucial in ensuring that victims are supported, investigations are conducted, and appropriate actions are taken to address any wrongdoing and protect the safety of all students on campus.

The answer is specific and actionable, as it clearly outlines a course of action to be taken in response to the situation at Baylor University. By reporting information promptly and to the appropriate authorities, the answer addresses the need for accountability and the protection of victims.

However, it could be further improved by also acknowledging the importance of creating a culture of transparency, accountability, and integrity within the football program and the university as a whole. It would be beneficial to recommend implementing training programs for coaches and staff on Title IX policies, reporting procedures, and ethical conduct. Additionally, advocating for a zero-tolerance policy towards sexual misconduct and ensuring that all members of the university community are aware of their responsibilities in preventing and addressing such issues would further enhance the ethical response.

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for addressing the ethical concerns raised in the scenario, but it could be strengthened by incorporating additional proactive measures to prevent future incidents and promote a safe and respectful environment for all students.
