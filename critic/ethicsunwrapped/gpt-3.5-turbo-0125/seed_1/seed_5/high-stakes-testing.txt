The answer provided is ethical as it acknowledges the concerns raised by parents, teachers, and administrators regarding high-stakes testing and seeks to address the situation through gathering information, exploring alternative assessment methods, and advocating for policy changes. 

Positively, the response emphasizes the importance of understanding the specific issues and perspectives involved, which is crucial for addressing the concerns effectively.
