The answer provided offers a practical and specific course of action for addressing the public outrage surrounding President Ford's decision to pardon Richard Nixon. By recommending a nationally televised press conference where President Ford explains the rationale behind the pardon, expresses empathy for public sentiment, and opens himself to questions, the response acknowledges the need for transparency and communication.

However, the answer could be improved by further emphasizing the importance of acknowledging the public's anger and frustration more explicitly. President Ford should demonstrate a deeper understanding of the gravity of the situation and offer a more heartfelt apology for the pain caused by the pardon. Additionally, the response could suggest concrete steps for President Ford to take in order to make amends with the public, such as initiating reforms to prevent similar abuses of power in the future or engaging in community outreach efforts to rebuild trust.

Overall, while the answer provides a clear and actionable plan for addressing the controversy, it could benefit from a stronger emphasis on acknowledging and addressing the emotional impact of the pardon on the American people, as well as proposing specific actions to reconcile with the public and prevent future distrust in government institutions.
