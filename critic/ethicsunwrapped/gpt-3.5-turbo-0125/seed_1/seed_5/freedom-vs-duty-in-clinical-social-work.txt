The answer provided is a practical and specific course of action that addresses the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. By suggesting scheduling a consultation with a supervisor or experienced colleague, the social worker is taking a proactive step to seek guidance and support in navigating the conflict between their religious beliefs and professional obligations. This demonstrates a commitment to upholding the client's best interests while also acknowledging the potential impact of personal beliefs on the therapeutic relationship.

One positive aspect of this approach is the willingness to seek outside perspective and guidance, which can help the social worker gain clarity and make a well-informed decision. Consulting with a supervisor or colleague can provide valuable insights and help the social worker consider alternative solutions that may be more aligned with ethical principles.

However, one potential drawback is the lack of consideration for the client's perspective and potential impact of transferring them to another therapist. While the social worker is prioritizing ethical considerations, it is important to also take into account the client's needs and preferences in the decision-making process.

Overall, the suggested course of action is a good starting point for addressing the ethical dilemma in a thoughtful and responsible manner. By seeking guidance and exploring alternative solutions, the social worker can work towards finding a resolution that upholds ethical principles while also considering the well-being of the client.
