The answer provided is fairly ethical. It addresses the issue of academic fraud at UNC by focusing on implementing and monitoring the reforms instituted by the university, such as higher governance standards, accountability measures, and audits. This proactive approach is commendable as it aims to prevent future instances of academic fraud. Furthermore, collaborating with relevant departments to support student-athletes in their academic pursuits shows a commitment to ensuring they receive a quality education.

However, the answer could be improved by being more specific about how these reforms will be implemented and monitored. For example, detailing the specific steps involved in conducting audits, establishing accountability measures, and providing academic support to student-athletes would make the response more actionable. Additionally, addressing the need for transparency and communication with stakeholders, including student-athletes, faculty, and the broader university community, would enhance the effectiveness of the proposed actions.
