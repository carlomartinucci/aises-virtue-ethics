Your answer provides a structured approach to evaluating the ethical and legal implications of Edward Snowden's actions. By suggesting the formation of a panel of experts to analyze the leaked information, you aim to address the complexity of the situation. This approach recognizes the need for a thorough examination of the content of the disclosures and the potential consequences they had on national security and privacy rights.

However, your response lacks a clear stance on whether Snowden's actions were ethical or not. While it is important to conduct a detailed analysis, taking a definitive position on the ethicality of his actions is crucial for making informed decisions about accountability.

To improve your answer, consider explicitly stating your perspective on whether Snowden's actions were ethically justified or not based on the information available. Additionally, provide specific criteria for evaluating the ethicality of whistleblowing in similar situations to offer actionable guidance for decision-making.

Overall, your response is well-structured and highlights the importance of a thorough evaluation, but it would benefit from a clearer ethical standpoint and more specific criteria for assessing the situation.
