The answer provided is a practical and actionable response to the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. By suggesting scheduling a consultation with a supervisor or experienced colleague, the social worker is taking a proactive step to seek guidance and support in navigating the conflict between their religious beliefs and professional obligations. This demonstrates a willingness to address the issue responsibly and ethically.

However, the answer could be improved by including a more detailed exploration of potential alternative solutions beyond transferring the client to another therapist. It would be beneficial to consider how the social worker could work through their personal beliefs to ensure they can continue providing unbiased and effective mental health treatment to the client. This could involve further self-reflection, seeking additional training or education on cultural competence, or exploring ways to separate personal beliefs from professional responsibilities.

Overall, the response is a good starting point in addressing the ethical dilemma, but could be enhanced by considering a wider range of solutions to ensure the client's best interests are prioritized while upholding professional ethics.
