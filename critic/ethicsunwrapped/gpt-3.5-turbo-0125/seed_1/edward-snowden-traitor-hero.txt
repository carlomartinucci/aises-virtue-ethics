The answer provided offers a practical and actionable approach to addressing the complexity of Edward Snowden's actions. By suggesting the formation of a panel of legal and ethical experts to analyze the leaked documents, the response aims to evaluate the specific content of the information disclosed, assess potential harm, and consider the public interest served. This approach acknowledges the need for a thorough examination of the implications of the surveillance programs on privacy rights and national security, as well as the exploration of alternative legal channels available to Snowden for reporting his concerns.

One positive aspect of this response is the emphasis on gathering relevant information through expert analysis, which could provide a more nuanced understanding of the situation. By considering both the potential harm caused and the public interest served, a more balanced assessment of Snowden's actions could be achieved. Additionally, the suggestion to explore legal channels available to Snowden within the existing framework of government oversight highlights the importance of adhering to established procedures.

However, a potential drawback of this approach is the lack of a clear stance on the ethical and legal culpability of Snowden. While the proposal to convene a panel of experts is valuable, it does not explicitly address whether Snowden should be held accountable for his actions or provide a definitive recommendation on how to proceed. This ambiguity may hinder the practical application of the suggested approach in making concrete decisions regarding Snowden's accountability.

Overall, the response offers a thoughtful and systematic method for evaluating Snowden's actions, but it could be strengthened by providing a more decisive stance on the ethical and legal implications of his whistleblowing and offering specific recommendations for potential courses of action.
