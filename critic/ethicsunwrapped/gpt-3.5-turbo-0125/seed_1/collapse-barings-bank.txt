The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on implementing practical and actionable steps to prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future. By emphasizing the importance of oversight, transparency, risk management, training, and collaboration with regulatory authorities, the response addresses key areas that need improvement to avoid catastrophic consequences like the collapse of Barings Bank.

The good aspects of the answer include the specific actions outlined, such as implementing stricter oversight measures, establishing transparent reporting systems, conducting comprehensive reviews, enhancing training programs, and collaborating with regulatory authorities. These actions are practical and can help mitigate the risks associated with unethical behavior in financial institutions.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of emphasis on individual accountability and consequences for unethical actions. While implementing preventive measures is crucial, it is also important to address the issue of personal responsibility and ensure that individuals who engage in fraudulent activities face appropriate consequences. Including measures to hold individuals accountable within the response would further strengthen its ethical stance.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical issues highlighted in the scenario, but it could be enhanced by incorporating specific actions related to individual accountability and consequences for unethical behavior.
