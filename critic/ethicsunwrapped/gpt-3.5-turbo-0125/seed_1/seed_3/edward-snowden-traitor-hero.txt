The answer provided offers a practical and actionable approach to addressing the complexity of Edward Snowden's actions. By suggesting the formation of a panel of legal and ethical experts to analyze the leaked documents, the answer acknowledges the need for a thorough evaluation of the information disclosed. This approach allows for a detailed assessment of the potential harm caused by Snowden's actions and the extent to which they served the public interest.

Furthermore, the suggestion to consider whether Snowden had alternative, legal channels available for reporting his concerns within the existing government oversight framework is a valuable point. This analysis would help determine whether Snowden's decision to leak the information was a last resort or if there were other avenues he could have pursued.

One potential improvement could be to emphasize the importance of transparency and public accountability in the evaluation process. Ensuring that the panel's findings are made transparent to the public can help build trust and understanding around the decision-making process.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for approaching the ethical and legal implications of Snowden's actions, focusing on a detailed analysis of the leaked information and exploring alternative reporting channels. By incorporating transparency and public accountability, the suggested approach could be further strengthened.
