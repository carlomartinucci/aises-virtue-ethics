The answer provided is a practical and specific course of action in response to the ethical dilemma presented. By seeking guidance from a supervisor or colleague experienced in ethical decision-making in social work practice, the social worker demonstrates a willingness to address the conflict between personal beliefs and professional obligations. Consulting with others allows for a broader perspective and consideration of alternative solutions, which is a positive aspect of the response. Additionally, committing to follow the guidance received during the consultation ensures that the client's best interests remain a priority.

However, the answer could be improved by explicitly mentioning the importance of maintaining confidentiality throughout the consultation process to protect the client's privacy. It would also be beneficial to address the potential impact on the therapeutic relationship and the client's trust if a decision to transfer the client is made. Including these considerations would enhance the overall evaluation of the response.
