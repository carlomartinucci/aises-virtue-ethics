The answer provided is specific and actionable in addressing the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. By suggesting convening a meeting with hospital staff to discuss the ethical implications, emphasizing respect for the patient's autonomy and truth-telling, and recommending consultation with the hospital's ethics committee for guidance, the response offers practical steps to navigate the complex situation.

Additionally, proposing alternative strategies for medication administration and advocating for transparency and honesty in the patient's care demonstrate a thoughtful approach towards balancing the need for treatment with ethical principles. However, it could be improved by explicitly stating the importance of involving the patient to the extent possible in decision-making processes, even if deemed mentally incompetent, to uphold their dignity and respect for personhood.

Overall, the response effectively addresses the ethical concerns raised in the scenario and provides practical steps for resolving the dilemma, while also highlighting the significance of ethical principles in healthcare decision-making.
