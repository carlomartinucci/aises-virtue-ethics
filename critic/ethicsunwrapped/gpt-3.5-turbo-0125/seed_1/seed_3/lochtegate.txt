The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it prioritizes conducting a thorough investigation into the incident, gathering evidence, and considering appropriate actions based on the findings. By interviewing all parties involved and working with legal counsel, the answer aims to address the situation in a fair and just manner.

However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the importance of accountability and responsibility. It should explicitly mention holding Lochte accountable for his actions and ensuring that he takes full responsibility for the consequences of his behavior. Additionally, the response could have included a more proactive approach to addressing the negative impact on the reputation of American athletes and the host city of Rio, such as organizing outreach programs or initiatives to repair any damage caused.

Overall, while the answer is mostly comprehensive and practical, it could benefit from a stronger emphasis on accountability and proactive measures to address the broader implications of Lochte's actions.
