On the positive side, the response emphasizes the importance of understanding the root causes of the behavior, conducting interviews to gather insights, and working collaboratively with hospital administration to implement preventive measures. These actions demonstrate a commitment to addressing the issue comprehensively and preventing future occurrences.

However, the response could be strengthened by specifying concrete steps for implementing monitoring and oversight mechanisms. Providing detailed plans for audits, spot checks, and training sessions would enhance the practicality of the proposed solution.
