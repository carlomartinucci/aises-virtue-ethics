The answer provided acknowledges the complexity of the situation and offers a practical suggestion for addressing the public outrage. The recommendation to hold a nationally televised press conference to explain the rationale behind the pardon and emphasize national unity is a proactive step towards transparency. By addressing the concerns and suspicions raised by the American people, President Ford can begin to rebuild trust and demonstrate his commitment to moving the country forward.

However, the answer could be improved by including specific details on how President Ford could address the public's concerns about accountability and justice. Providing more concrete actions or initiatives that Ford could take to ensure that accountability is upheld while still focusing on national unity would enhance the response. Additionally, addressing potential criticisms or counterarguments to the proposed solution would add depth to the evaluation.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical considerations surrounding the pardon of Nixon, but could benefit from further specificity and consideration of potential challenges in implementing the proposed recommendation.
