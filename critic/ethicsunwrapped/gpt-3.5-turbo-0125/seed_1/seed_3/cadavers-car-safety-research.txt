Your answer is specific and practical in addressing the ethical concerns raised in the scenario. By focusing on reviewing research protocols, ensuring proper consent procedures, and facilitating discussions with stakeholders, you are taking actionable steps to address the ethical implications of using human cadavers in car crash tests. Additionally, your suggestion to explore alternative research methods demonstrates a proactive approach to finding solutions that are both ethically sound and scientifically rigorous.

However, one potential drawback is the lack of emphasis on the urgency of the situation. Given the public outcry and ethical concerns raised by various groups, a more immediate response might be necessary to address the ethical implications of the research. It would be beneficial to consider implementing temporary measures to suspend the use of human cadavers until a thorough review and consensus-building process is completed.

Overall, your response is thorough and provides a solid framework for addressing the ethical dilemmas presented in the scenario. To enhance your approach, consider adding a sense of urgency and implementing temporary measures to address the immediate concerns while working towards long-term solutions.
