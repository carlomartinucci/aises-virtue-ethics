The answer provided acknowledges the complexity of the situation and offers a practical solution to address the public outrage. Recommending a nationally televised press conference for President Ford to explain the rationale behind the pardon is a proactive step towards transparency and accountability. By emphasizing the need for national unity and preventing further division, the answer recognizes the importance of moving forward from the Watergate scandal.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting additional actions that President Ford could take to address the concerns raised by the public. For example, President Ford could consider appointing an independent commission to investigate the Watergate scandal and provide a comprehensive report to the public. This would demonstrate a commitment to uncovering the truth and holding individuals accountable for any wrongdoing.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical implications of President Ford's decision to pardon Nixon. By expanding on the proposed actions and considering other avenues for transparency and accountability, the response could offer a more comprehensive approach to rebuilding trust with the American people.
