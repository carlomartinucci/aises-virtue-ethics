By conducting a thorough review of academic records, interviewing key individuals involved, and collaborating with relevant authorities, the responder aims to uncover the extent of the fraud, understand motivations, and ensure appropriate disciplinary actions are taken.

Positively, the plan outlined demonstrates a proactive approach to investigating the academic fraud and holding those responsible accountable. By involving relevant parties and authorities, there is a potential for a comprehensive understanding of the situation and implementation of necessary measures to prevent future incidents.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of emphasis on supporting the affected student-athletes who may have been victims of the fraud. While the focus on investigation and discipline is crucial, it is also important to address any academic repercussions or support needed for these individuals.

To improve the response, it would be beneficial to include a component dedicated to providing resources or assistance to student-athletes impacted by the fraud. This could involve academic support, counseling services, or opportunities for academic redemption to ensure that the students are not unfairly penalized for the actions of others. Additionally, outlining a plan for transparency and communication with the broader university community could help rebuild trust and address concerns regarding academic integrity.
