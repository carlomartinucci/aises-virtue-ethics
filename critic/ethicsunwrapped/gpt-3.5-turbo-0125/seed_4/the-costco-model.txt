The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on prioritizing fair wages, comprehensive benefits, career advancement opportunities, and employee input to improve working conditions. By emphasizing these aspects, the response aligns with Costco's ethical practices of valuing employees and treating them well. Implementing policies that ensure fair compensation and providing avenues for growth and feedback can indeed lead to increased employee satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately benefiting the company's success.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the potential challenges and complexities that may arise in implementing such policies. It would be beneficial to consider how to balance the costs of higher wages and benefits with the company's financial sustainability, especially in industries with different operational models than that of Costco. Additionally, incorporating specific strategies for measuring the effectiveness of these policies and adjusting them as needed based on feedback and performance metrics would enhance the practicality of the response.

Overall, the answer is on the right track by focusing on employee well-being and engagement, but it could be strengthened by addressing potential obstacles and outlining more specific implementation strategies and evaluation methods.
