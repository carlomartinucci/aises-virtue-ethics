By seeking information from various sources and perspectives, the individual can make informed decisions or recommendations regarding the ethical concerns surrounding bullfighting.

Simply gathering information without a clear plan for action may result in a lack of progress in addressing the ethical concerns surrounding bullfighting.

In conclusion, while conducting research is a necessary first step in addressing the ethical complexities of bullfighting, it is important to complement this with actionable steps towards promoting animal welfare and cultural preservation. Balancing information gathering with proactive measures will be key to making a meaningful impact on the ethical considerations surrounding bullfighting.
