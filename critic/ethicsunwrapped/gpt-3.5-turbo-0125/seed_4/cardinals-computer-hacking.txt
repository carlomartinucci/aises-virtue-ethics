The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it advocates for reporting illegal actions to the appropriate authorities and cooperating with the investigation. By doing so, it upholds the principles of accountability and justice. It also emphasizes the importance of implementing security measures to prevent future incidents, which is a proactive step towards safeguarding against potential breaches.

However, the answer lacks specificity in terms of addressing the potential consequences for Chris Correa beyond reporting his actions. It could have delved deeper into the ethical implications of his behavior, such as the violation of privacy and intellectual property theft. Additionally, it could have highlighted the importance of addressing any systemic issues within the organization that may have enabled such misconduct to occur.

In conclusion, while the answer provides a foundation for ethical action by advocating for reporting and cooperation, it could have been more comprehensive by addressing the broader ethical considerations and proposing concrete steps to address the root causes of the incident.
