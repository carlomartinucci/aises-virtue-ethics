The answer provided is specific and actionable, focusing on acknowledging Valerie Plame's concerns about national security risks, communicating with her to understand her perspective, and offering support in exploring potential avenues to address these concerns. It suggests working with relevant stakeholders, advocating for increased oversight on presidential pardons related to national security, and raising awareness through public outreach efforts.

Positively, the response demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing the issue at hand by engaging with Plame and potentially collaborating with other stakeholders to advocate for increased oversight. It also emphasizes the importance of public awareness and education on the implications of such pardons.

However, a potential improvement could be to provide more concrete steps on how to effectively advocate for increased oversight on presidential pardons related to national security. This could involve outlining specific actions to engage with congressional representatives, advocacy groups, or legal experts to push for policy changes or reforms in the pardon process to prevent similar situations in the future.

Overall, the response is practical and actionable, but could benefit from additional specificity in outlining steps for advocacy and engagement with stakeholders to address the concerns raised by Valerie Plame.
