The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of reporting the incident to the authorities, supporting the victim, and cooperating fully with the investigation. By taking immediate action and ensuring the victim's well-being, the answer aligns with ethical principles of prioritizing the safety and protection of individuals.

However, the answer could be improved by including specific steps on how to support the victim, such as offering counseling services or connecting them with appropriate resources. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to address the need for accountability and transparency in handling such serious allegations, including the importance of not keeping the information quiet and actively working to prevent further harm.

Overall, the answer is on the right track by focusing on reporting the incident and supporting the victim, but it could be enhanced by providing more detailed actions to ensure a comprehensive and ethical response to the situation.
