The answer provided is specific and actionable, as it outlines a clear plan to investigate the financial records and transactions of Tyco International during Dennis Kozlowski's tenure. By conducting a thorough investigation, the authenticity of the claims made by both Kozlowski and the prosecutors can be verified, shedding light on whether the bonuses were truly unauthorized and if there was criminal intent involved in the financial decisions.

This approach is good as it aims to gather concrete evidence and information to reach a fair conclusion about the situation. By analyzing documentation, reviewing company policies, and assessing compliance breaches, a comprehensive evaluation of the circumstances can be achieved.

However, a potential downside of this approach could be the time and resources required to conduct such a thorough investigation. It may also be challenging to navigate the complexities of corporate financial records and policies, especially in a high-profile case like this. Additionally, there is a risk of bias influencing the investigation process, as well as the interpretation of the findings.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and specific course of action to address the ethical concerns raised in the scenario, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based decision-making and compliance with corporate governance standards.
