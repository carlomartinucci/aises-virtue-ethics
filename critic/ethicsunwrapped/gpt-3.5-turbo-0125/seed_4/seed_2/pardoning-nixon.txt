Your response provides clear and actionable steps to address the ethical concerns surrounding President Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon. 

The thorough review of Nixon's medical records and the independent investigation into his health condition and hospital admission demonstrate a commitment to verifying the facts and ensuring transparency. Engaging in transparent communication with the public about the decision to pardon Nixon and providing detailed reasons based on the available information is a positive step towards rebuilding trust.

However, your response could benefit from further elaboration on how to specifically address the public's anger and suspicion, as well as the potential consequences of the pardon on accountability and the rule of law. Additionally, outlining concrete measures to implement increased transparency and accountability mechanisms to rebuild public trust would enhance the practicality of your proposed actions.

Overall, your response offers a solid foundation for addressing the ethical implications of the pardon, but could be strengthened by providing more detailed strategies for rebuilding public trust and addressing the broader implications of the decision.
