The answer provided is specific and actionable in addressing the ethical concerns related to Apple's supply chain practices. By advocating for a thorough investigation into the working conditions in the mines where tin is sourced, the response demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing the issue. Additionally, the suggestion to work with Apple's management to develop and implement a plan to improve labor rights and safety standards shows a commitment to making tangible improvements.

However, a potential drawback of the answer is the lack of emphasis on the urgency of the situation. Given the gravity of the reported dangerous working conditions, a more immediate response may be necessary to ensure the well-being of the workers involved. The answer could benefit from a sense of urgency in addressing the violations and implementing corrective actions promptly.

Overall, the response provides a solid framework for addressing the ethical concerns in Apple's supply chain, but could be enhanced by incorporating a more urgent timeline for implementing the proposed measures.
