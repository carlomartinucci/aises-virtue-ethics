This response outlines specific steps to address the unethical practices at Enron. The suggestion to conduct a thorough investigation, identify and discipline those involved, and assess legal liabilities demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing the issue. The emphasis on communication and transparency with stakeholders is also commendable, as it shows a recognition of the need to rebuild trust and credibility.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more details on how exactly the investigation would be conducted, such as who would be involved, what resources would be allocated, and what specific methods would be used to uncover the extent of the unethical practices. Additionally, the response could benefit from a clearer plan outlining how Enron would prevent similar incidents in the future, including specific steps for implementing stricter internal controls and ethics training programs.

Overall, while the response offers a solid framework for addressing the situation at Enron, it could be enhanced by providing more specific and actionable details on how each step would be carried out to effectively address the ethical issues and prevent their recurrence.
