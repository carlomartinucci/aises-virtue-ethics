The answer provided is a good starting point for addressing the ethical issues in Apple's supply chain. The proposed investigation into the supply chain to verify reports of dangerous working conditions shows a commitment to uncovering the truth and taking action based on evidence. The plan to work with Apple's management to develop and implement corrective measures, such as enforcing stricter supplier requirements and providing support to improve working conditions, demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing the ethical concerns.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The answer could have been more specific about the steps that would be taken to ensure the effectiveness of the plan. For example, setting clear and measurable goals for improvement, establishing a timeline for implementing changes, and outlining consequences for suppliers who do not comply with ethical standards would enhance the plan's impact. Additionally, the answer could have addressed the issue of accountability, such as outlining how progress would be monitored and reported transparently to stakeholders.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical challenges in Apple's supply chain, but it could be strengthened by incorporating more specific actions and mechanisms for accountability and transparency.
