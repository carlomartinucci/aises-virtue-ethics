The answer provided is ethical and demonstrates a commitment to addressing the potential conflicts of interest in a responsible manner. By promptly reporting the situation to senior partners or the firm's ethics committee, the individual is taking the necessary steps to ensure transparency and accountability within the law firm. Additionally, suggesting an internal investigation shows a proactive approach to understanding the extent of the issue and resolving any ethical violations that may have occurred.
