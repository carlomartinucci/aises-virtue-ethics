The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being and safety of all parties involved in the cyberbullying incident. By arranging a private meeting with the student to discuss the impact of her actions and offering support and guidance, the responder acknowledges the importance of addressing underlying issues and promoting positive online behavior. Organizing a school-wide workshop on cyberbullying prevention and updating school policies demonstrate a proactive approach to creating a culture of respect and responsibility.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The responder could have emphasized the importance of empathy and understanding towards the student who posted the hurtful messages, while still holding her accountable for her actions. Additionally, addressing the concerns raised about privacy and rights could be further strengthened by explicitly outlining how disciplinary actions would be fair and considerate of all parties involved.

Overall, the response provides practical steps to address the cyberbullying incident in a comprehensive and supportive manner, focusing on education, prevention, and support for both the teacher and the student.
