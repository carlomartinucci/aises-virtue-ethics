The answer provided is overall ethical as it emphasizes the importance of reviewing all available information, consulting with legal experts, and working with law enforcement and prosecutors to ensure justice is served fairly in the case involving Rush Limbaugh's illegal obtaining of prescription drugs. The suggestion to advocate for increased awareness and resources for addiction treatment is also a positive step towards addressing the underlying issues contributing to substance abuse.

However, the response could be improved by incorporating a more proactive approach towards preventing such situations in the future. This could involve advocating for stricter regulations or monitoring systems to prevent individuals from engaging in "doctor shopping" or other means of obtaining prescription drugs illegally. Additionally, promoting education and awareness campaigns about the dangers of prescription drug abuse could help prevent others from falling into similar situations.

Overall, the answer is ethical and provides a good framework for addressing the issue at hand, but could benefit from including more proactive measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.
