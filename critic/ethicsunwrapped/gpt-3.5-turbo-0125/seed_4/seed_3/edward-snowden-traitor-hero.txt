The answer provided suggests that Snowden should have followed internal channels within the government to report any perceived wrongdoing before leaking classified information to the press. This approach emphasizes the importance of upholding the rule of law and government processes, which is a positive aspect. By recommending internal reporting mechanisms, it highlights the significance of following established procedures to address concerns within an organization.

However, the answer fails to fully acknowledge the complexities of Snowden's situation. It overlooks the potential risks Snowden might have faced by using internal channels, such as retaliation or suppression of his concerns. Additionally, it does not address the argument that the law itself might have been unjust or unconstitutional, which could have influenced Snowden's decision to leak the information.

To improve the evaluation, it would be beneficial to recognize the ethical dilemma Snowden faced and the different perspectives on the legality and morality of his actions. Acknowledging the nuances of the situation and considering the broader context of government surveillance programs and individual privacy rights would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the ethical implications of Snowden's actions.
