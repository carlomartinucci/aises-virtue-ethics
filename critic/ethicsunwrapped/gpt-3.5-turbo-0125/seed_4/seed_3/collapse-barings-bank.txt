The answer provided is quite ethical as it emphasizes proactive measures to prevent unauthorized and risky trades, implement strict risk management procedures, establish clear reporting mechanisms, and conduct thorough audits to prevent potential fraud or misconduct. These actions are practical and actionable in ensuring transparency, accountability, and oversight in trading activities. However, the evaluation could be improved by suggesting the need to also enhance training and awareness on ethical conduct and accountability among employees, as well as fostering a culture that encourages speaking up about concerns or issues without fear of repercussions. Additionally, setting up an independent oversight committee or compliance team could further strengthen the monitoring and control mechanisms to prevent such catastrophic losses in the future.
