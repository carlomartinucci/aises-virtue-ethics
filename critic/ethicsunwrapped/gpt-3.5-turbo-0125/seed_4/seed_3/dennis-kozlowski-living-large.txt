The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it suggests conducting a thorough investigation into the financial records and transactions of Tyco International during Dennis Kozlowski's tenure as CEO. This approach is fair and objective, aiming to verify the authenticity of the claims made by both Kozlowski and the prosecutors. By analyzing documentation and reviewing company policies and procedures, the answer seeks to uncover any unauthorized actions or breaches of compliance that may have occurred.

On the positive side, the proposed investigation demonstrates a commitment to uncovering the truth and ensuring accountability for any financial misconduct that may have taken place. By examining the facts and evidence, a clearer picture of the situation can be obtained, potentially shedding light on whether criminal intent was involved in the unauthorized bonuses and other questionable financial decisions.

However, a potential drawback of the answer is the lack of consideration for the broader ethical implications beyond legal compliance. While the focus on verifying claims and assessing compliance breaches is important, there is a need to also address the ethical standards and principles that should guide the behavior of corporate leaders. The answer could benefit from emphasizing the importance of ethical conduct and integrity in addition to legal compliance.

Overall, the answer is a practical and actionable approach to addressing the allegations of financial misconduct at Tyco International. By conducting a thorough investigation and reviewing company policies, it seeks to uncover the truth and ensure accountability, though it could be enhanced by a stronger emphasis on ethical considerations alongside legal compliance.
