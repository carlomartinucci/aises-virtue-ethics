Your answer demonstrates a proactive and thorough approach to addressing the ethical concerns raised by the use of human cadavers in simulated car crash tests. By proposing a review of research protocols, ensuring proper consent procedures, and involving relevant stakeholders, you show a commitment to transparency and ethical integrity.

One strength of your response is the emphasis on collaboration with experts and affected parties to evaluate the ethical implications comprehensively. This approach can help in considering diverse perspectives and reaching informed decisions.

However, a potential area for improvement is the lack of specificity in outlining concrete steps for implementing these actions. Providing more detailed plans, such as setting up a review committee, establishing clear guidelines for consent procedures, and defining criteria for assessing the scientific necessity of cadaver use, would enhance the practicality of your response.

Overall, your answer shows a commendable intention to address the ethical challenges posed by the research practices in question. By enhancing the specificity and actionable steps outlined, you can further strengthen the effectiveness of your proposed course of action.
