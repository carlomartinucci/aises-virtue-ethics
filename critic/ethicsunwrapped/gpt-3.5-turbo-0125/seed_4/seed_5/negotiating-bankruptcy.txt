The answer provided is ethical. By recommending reporting the situation to the appropriate authorities within the law firm and suggesting an internal investigation to address any ethical violations or conflicts of interest, the response acknowledges the seriousness of the situation and the need for corrective action.

Positives:
1. Immediate action: The suggestion to report the situation promptly shows a proactive approach to addressing the issue.
2. Detailed account: Recommending providing a detailed account of the failure to disclose indicates a commitment to transparency and accountability.
3. Internal investigation: Proposing an internal investigation demonstrates a willingness to uncover the extent of the problem and take corrective measures.

Areas for Improvement:
1. Lack of specificity: While the general steps are outlined, the response could benefit from specific details on how to approach senior partners, what information to include in the report, and the exact procedures for conducting an internal investigation.
2. Clarity on corrective actions: It would be helpful to suggest specific actions that could be taken post-investigation to rectify any ethical violations and prevent similar issues in the future.

Overall, the response is a good starting point for addressing the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. By providing more specific guidance on the next steps and potential corrective actions, the approach could be further strengthened.
