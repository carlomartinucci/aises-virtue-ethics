The answer provided is quite ethical as it prioritizes the well-being and safety of all parties involved in the cyberbullying incident. By arranging a private meeting with the student to discuss her actions and providing support and guidance, the responder is addressing the root cause of the issue in a constructive and educational manner. Organizing a school-wide workshop on social media etiquette and cyberbullying prevention shows a proactive approach to educating students and fostering a culture of respect and empathy.

However, there are areas for improvement. While it is crucial to address the concerns raised about privacy and rights, the response could have emphasized the importance of balancing accountability with understanding towards teenagers' immaturity, as noted by Sameer Hinduja. Additionally, involving mental health professionals to support both the teacher and the student is commendable, but the answer could have further emphasized the long-term emotional well-being and ongoing support needed for all parties involved.

In summary, the response is ethical in its actions to address cyberbullying within a school setting, but it could enhance its approach by emphasizing empathy, understanding, and long-term support for all individuals impacted by the incident.
