The answer provided is specific and actionable in addressing the unethical behavior exhibited by Nick Leeson at Barings Bank. Implementing closer supervision of trading activities, strict risk management procedures, clear reporting mechanisms, and thorough audits are all practical steps to prevent unauthorized or risky trades, detect discrepancies, and ensure transparency in trading operations.

On the positive side, these measures would help mitigate the risk of a similar situation occurring in the future by increasing oversight and accountability within the organization. By implementing clear reporting mechanisms and conducting regular audits, potential issues can be identified and addressed promptly, preventing losses from escalating out of control.

However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the importance of fostering a culture of transparency and accountability within the organization. It would be beneficial to also mention the need for robust internal controls, ethical training for employees, and a zero-tolerance policy for unethical behavior. Additionally, the answer could have included a plan for disciplinary action and consequences for employees found engaging in fraudulent activities to deter such behavior in the future.

Overall, while the proposed actions are practical and necessary to prevent a recurrence of the Barings Bank collapse, there is room for improvement in terms of promoting a culture of ethics and integrity within the organization and outlining consequences for unethical conduct.
