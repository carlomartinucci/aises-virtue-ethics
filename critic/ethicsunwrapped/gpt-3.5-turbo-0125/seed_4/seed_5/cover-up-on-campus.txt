The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on taking concrete actions to address the systemic issues within the Baylor University football program. By reporting the findings and actions of the Board of Regents to law enforcement authorities, the answer acknowledges the importance of accountability and justice for the mishandling of sexual assault cases. Furthermore, working with university officials to implement reforms and training programs demonstrates a commitment to preventing similar incidents in the future and ensuring that victims receive the proper support and protection.
