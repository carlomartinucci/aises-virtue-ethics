The answer provided outlines a practical course of action in response to the unethical practices at Enron. Conducting a thorough investigation to identify individuals involved, taking disciplinary action, and working with legal counsel to assess liabilities are important steps to address the issue. Prioritizing communication and transparency with stakeholders is crucial for rebuilding trust and demonstrating a commitment to rectifying the situation.

However, one potential shortcoming is the lack of emphasis on accountability at the leadership level, particularly towards CEO Ken Lay and other top executives who may have been aware of or condoned the unethical practices. Holding them accountable and addressing systemic issues within the organization would be essential to prevent such misconduct from recurring.

Additionally, the response could benefit from a more detailed plan for implementing internal controls, ethics training programs, and oversight mechanisms. These measures should be clearly outlined and executed to ensure lasting change within the company's culture and operations.

Overall, the plan presented is a good starting point, but further actions to address leadership accountability and enhance preventive measures would strengthen the ethical response to the Enron scandal.
