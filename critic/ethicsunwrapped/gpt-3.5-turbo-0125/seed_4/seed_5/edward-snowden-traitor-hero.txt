The answer provided suggests that Snowden should have followed internal channels within the government to report any perceived wrongdoing before leaking classified information to the press. This course of action is practical in the sense that it emphasizes utilizing established procedures for reporting misconduct and upholding the rule of law. By following internal channels first, Snowden could have potentially addressed his concerns in a more lawful manner and avoided the legal repercussions associated with leaking classified information.

However, the answer fails to acknowledge the potential risks and challenges that whistleblowers face when reporting misconduct internally. Snowden may have had valid reasons for not trusting internal channels within the government to address his concerns effectively. The answer also does not fully consider the argument that the law itself may have been unjust or unconstitutional, which could have justified Snowden's decision to leak the information.

In conclusion, while the answer provides a practical suggestion for Snowden to follow internal channels, it lacks a nuanced understanding of the complexities surrounding whistleblowing and the potential limitations of internal reporting mechanisms. It would have been more comprehensive if it had acknowledged the challenges whistleblowers face and considered the context of Snowden's actions within the broader debate on government transparency and accountability.
