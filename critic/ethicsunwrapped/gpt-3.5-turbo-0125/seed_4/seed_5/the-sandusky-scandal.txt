The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of reporting the incident to the authorities, supporting the victim, and cooperating fully with the investigation. By taking immediate action and ensuring that the victim's well-being is prioritized, it demonstrates a commitment to justice and accountability.

However, the answer could be improved by including specific steps to address the systemic issues within the organization that allowed the situation to persist. For instance, advocating for policy changes, whistleblower protection, and regular training on recognizing and reporting abuse could help prevent similar incidents in the future.

Additionally, acknowledging the failure to act sooner and expressing remorse for not taking more decisive action in hindsight would show a deeper understanding of the ethical implications of the situation. Taking responsibility for past inaction and committing to making meaningful changes moving forward would be a more comprehensive and proactive approach to addressing the ethical concerns raised by the scenario.
