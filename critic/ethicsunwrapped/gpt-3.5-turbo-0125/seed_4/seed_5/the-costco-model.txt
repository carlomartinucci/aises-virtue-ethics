The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of fair wages, comprehensive benefits, career advancement opportunities, and employee engagement within a company similar to Costco. By prioritizing these aspects, the company can foster a positive work environment, enhance employee satisfaction, and potentially achieve greater success in the long term. 

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the potential challenges and complexities of implementing such policies. It would be beneficial to consider how these changes could impact the company's overall profitability, competitiveness, and sustainability. Additionally, incorporating strategies to mitigate any potential resistance or barriers to change within the organization would be valuable.
