The answer provided is quite specific and actionable. It suggests conducting a review of specific powers granted to the President by the Constitution and Congress, seeking input from legal experts, and prioritizing upholding the rule of law and adhering to established procedures. These recommendations are practical and can help ensure that decisions are well-informed and legally sound.

One potential drawback is that the response leans heavily towards a strict constructionist approach, advocating for adherence to existing legal frameworks and procedures. While this is important for maintaining legal integrity, it may overlook the aspect of flexibility and innovation that a stewardship presidency like Roosevelt's could bring. It would be beneficial to also consider the potential benefits of a stewardship approach in certain situations where quick action or adaptation is required.

In summary, the answer provides clear and actionable steps for decision-making but could benefit from a more balanced consideration of the merits of both the stewardship and strict constructionist models in specific contexts.
