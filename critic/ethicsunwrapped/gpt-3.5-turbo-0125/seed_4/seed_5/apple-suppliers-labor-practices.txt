The answer provided is a solid and practical approach to addressing the ethical concerns in Apple's supply chain. By conducting a thorough investigation into the working conditions in the mines where tin is sourced, the responder demonstrates a commitment to uncovering the truth and taking appropriate action. The emphasis on gathering information from various sources and working with Apple's management to develop a plan shows a collaborative and proactive approach to addressing the issue.

Furthermore, the focus on enforcing stricter supplier requirements, providing training and support, and potentially changing sourcing practices reflects a comprehensive strategy to improve labor rights and safety standards in the supply chain. Monitoring the implementation of these measures and assessing progress over time also ensures accountability and sustainability in addressing the ethical concerns.

However, the answer could be strengthened by specifically outlining steps for holding suppliers accountable if they fail to meet the new requirements, as well as detailing how workers' voices and perspectives will be prioritized throughout the process. Additionally, more emphasis could be placed on the importance of transparency and communication with stakeholders to build trust and ensure long-term improvements.

Overall, the response provides a practical and actionable plan for addressing the ethical concerns in Apple's supply chain, but could benefit from further detail and emphasis on stakeholder engagement and accountability mechanisms.
