The answer provided is a comprehensive and practical approach to addressing the ethical concerns in Apple's supply chain. By conducting a thorough investigation into the working conditions in the mines, gathering information from various sources, and working with Apple's management to develop and implement a plan, the answer demonstrates a proactive stance towards addressing the issue.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on verification through independent sources and on-site visits, ensuring that decisions are based on accurate information. Additionally, the proposed plan includes concrete steps such as enforcing stricter supplier requirements, providing training, and potentially sourcing from ethical mines, which shows a commitment to tangible actions to improve the situation.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of consideration for the complexities involved in the global supply chain and the challenges of enforcing changes in a complex network of suppliers. The answer could benefit from addressing how to navigate these complexities effectively and ensure that the proposed measures are feasible and sustainable in the long term.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for addressing the ethical concerns in Apple's supply chain, but could be strengthened by further consideration of the challenges involved in implementing changes in a global supply chain context.
