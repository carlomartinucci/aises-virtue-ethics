The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on taking concrete actions to address the serious issues at hand. By reporting the findings to law enforcement authorities and working with university officials to implement reforms and training programs, the answer aims to hold accountable those responsible for mishandling sexual assault cases and prevent such incidents from happening in the future.

The strengths of this answer lie in its proactive approach to seeking justice for the victims and ensuring that proper measures are put in place to prevent similar incidents. By involving law enforcement, it acknowledges the severity of the situation and the need for legal consequences for those involved in the mishandling of cases. Additionally, the emphasis on implementing reforms and training programs shows a commitment to creating a safer environment for all students on campus.

However, a potential weakness of this answer is the lack of specific details on the exact steps that would be taken to ensure the implementation of reforms and training programs. Providing more specific action points, such as conducting regular audits, establishing clear reporting protocols, and offering support services for victims, would enhance the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the gravity of the situation and offers a practical and actionable approach to address the ethical issues at Baylor University.
