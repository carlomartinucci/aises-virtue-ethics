The answer provided suggests that Snowden should have followed internal channels within the government to report any perceived wrongdoing before leaking classified information to the press. This approach emphasizes the importance of upholding the rule of law and government processes, as well as considering the ethical implications of his actions in a more balanced manner.

Positively, recommending the use of internal channels aligns with established protocols for addressing concerns within organizations and can help maintain trust in government institutions. It also highlights the significance of following lawful procedures to address grievances, promoting accountability and transparency.

However, the answer overlooks the potential risks and challenges that whistleblowers like Snowden may face when reporting misconduct internally, such as retaliation, lack of protection, or suppression of information. It fails to acknowledge the context in which Snowden operated, where he believed that the government's actions were violating citizens' rights on a massive scale, which may have influenced his decision to go public.

In conclusion, while the recommendation to exhaust internal channels is a valid point in promoting lawful behavior and ethical considerations, it falls short in recognizing the complexities and potential limitations whistleblowers may encounter within government structures. A more comprehensive evaluation would involve acknowledging the broader context of Snowden's actions and the challenges he faced in balancing legal obligations with moral imperatives.
