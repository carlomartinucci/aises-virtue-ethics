The answer provided is specific and actionable, suggesting conducting further research to better understand the underlying psychological mechanisms at play in green consumer behavior and moral licensing effects. This recommendation is practical and could lead to valuable insights that can help in developing interventions to mitigate negative consequences.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting more concrete steps for conducting this additional research. For example, specifying the types of experiments that could be designed, outlining a research plan, or proposing potential methodologies to explore the relationship between green consumption and unethical behaviors in more detail.

Overall, the response is a good starting point, but could benefit from more detailed and specific action steps to enhance its effectiveness in addressing the issue at hand.
