For example, outlining specific steps to improve transparency in the consent process and detailing how you would address concerns raised by different groups could enhance the practicality of your response.

Overall, your answer presents a solid foundation for addressing the ethical dilemmas surrounding the use of human cadavers in research, but adding more detailed action points would strengthen the effectiveness of your proposed approach.
