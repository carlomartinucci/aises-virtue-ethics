The answer provided suggests a practical course of action for Snowden to follow established procedures within the government to report any perceived wrongdoing before resorting to leaking classified information. This approach emphasizes the importance of respecting internal channels and upholding the rule of law.

Positives:
1. Emphasizes the importance of following established procedures within the government.
2. Encourages a more balanced consideration of the ethical implications of Snowden's actions.
3. Upholds the rule of law and government processes.

Negatives:
1. The answer does not fully address the argument that Snowden believed the government's violation of privacy had to be exposed regardless of legality.
2. It does not acknowledge the potential risks or consequences that Snowden may have faced by utilizing internal channels for reporting misconduct within the government.
3. The answer does not consider the possibility that internal channels may have been ineffective or compromised, leading Snowden to choose whistleblowing as a last resort.

Overall, the answer provides a practical recommendation for Snowden to consider but lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the complexities surrounding his actions. It could be improved by acknowledging the challenges and risks associated with internal reporting channels and by addressing the conflicting views on the legality and ethics of Snowden's actions more explicitly.
