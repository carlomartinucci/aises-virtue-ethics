The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of taking immediate action, reporting the incident to the authorities, cooperating with the investigation, and ensuring the victim's safety and well-being. By following these steps, the individual would have demonstrated a commitment to protecting the victim and holding the perpetrator accountable for their actions.

However, the evaluation could be improved by highlighting the need for the individual to also address the systemic issues that allowed such misconduct to continue unchecked for so long. This could involve advocating for changes in policies and procedures within the institution to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of transparency, accountability, and a zero-tolerance approach towards any form of abuse within the organization would further strengthen the ethical response.
