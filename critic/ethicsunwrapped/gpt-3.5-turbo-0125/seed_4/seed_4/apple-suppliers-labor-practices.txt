The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing the ethical concerns in Apple's supply chain related to the dangerous working conditions in the tin mines. By conducting a thorough investigation into the supply chain, gathering information from various sources, and working with Apple's management to develop and implement a plan to address violations, the answer proposes actionable steps to improve the situation.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on conducting a thorough investigation to verify the reports of dangerous working conditions. This shows a commitment to gathering accurate information before taking action. Additionally, the suggestion to work with Apple's management to develop and implement a plan is a proactive approach to addressing the ethical issues in the supply chain.

However, one potential drawback is the lack of specificity in outlining the exact steps that would be taken to enforce stricter supplier requirements, provide training and support, and potentially source tin from ethical mines. Providing more detailed action points and timelines for implementation could enhance the effectiveness of the proposed plan.

Overall, the answer presents a practical and actionable approach to addressing the ethical concerns in Apple's supply chain, but there is room for improvement in terms of specificity in outlining the steps to be taken and monitoring progress over time.
