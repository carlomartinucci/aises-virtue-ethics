The answer provided is ethical as it aligns with the principles of accountability, justice, and prevention of future wrongdoing. By reporting Chris Correa's actions to the appropriate authorities and cooperating fully with the investigation, it upholds the importance of holding individuals accountable for their unethical behavior. Additionally, implementing enhanced security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future demonstrates a commitment to ethical conduct and safeguarding against potential harm.

However, one area for improvement is the lack of emphasis on supporting any affected parties, such as the Houston Astros, in recovering from the breach and addressing any potential damages caused. It would be beneficial to include a proactive approach to assisting those impacted by the hacking incident, such as offering support or restitution where appropriate.

In conclusion, the suggested course of action is a commendable starting point in addressing the ethical dilemma presented. By enhancing the response with a focus on supporting affected parties, the overall ethical response could be further strengthened and more comprehensive in addressing the consequences of Chris Correa's actions.
