The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being and safety of the student involved in cyberbullying while also considering the need for education and support for both the student and the teacher. By arranging a private meeting with the student to discuss the impact of her actions and providing guidance on appropriate online behavior, the responder addresses the root cause of the issue in a constructive and educational manner. Organizing a school-wide workshop on social media etiquette and cyberbullying prevention is a proactive step towards creating a culture of respect and responsibility among students.

However, there are areas for improvement. The responder could have emphasized the importance of empathy and understanding towards the student who engaged in cyberbullying, acknowledging that teenagers may demonstrate immaturity at times. It would also be beneficial to involve parents in the process to ensure consistent support and education at home and in the school environment. Additionally, while addressing privacy concerns, the responder could have mentioned the importance of maintaining confidentiality and discretion when dealing with sensitive issues involving students.

Overall, the answer provides practical steps to address cyberbullying incidents in a school setting, focusing on education, support, and policy review to create a safer and more inclusive environment for all parties involved.
