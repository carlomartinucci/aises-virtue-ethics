The answer provided is a strong and ethical response to the scenario presented. By suggesting a thorough investigation into Apple's supply chain to verify reports of dangerous working conditions, the answer demonstrates a commitment to uncovering the truth and addressing potential violations. The plan to work with Apple's management to develop and implement measures to improve labor rights and safety standards shows a proactive approach to tackling the issue at hand. Additionally, the emphasis on monitoring and assessing progress over time highlights the importance of sustainability and ongoing improvement.

However, one potential drawback of the answer is the lack of specificity in terms of the timeline for conducting the investigation and implementing the plan. Providing a more detailed timeline with clear milestones and deadlines could help ensure accountability and drive progress. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include a section on communication strategies, outlining how findings and progress updates will be shared with stakeholders to maintain transparency and build trust.

Overall, this response demonstrates a strong ethical stance and a practical plan of action for addressing the complex business ethics issues surrounding Apple's supply chain practices. By incorporating additional specificity in terms of timelines and communication strategies, the plan could be further strengthened to ensure effective implementation and long-term impact.
