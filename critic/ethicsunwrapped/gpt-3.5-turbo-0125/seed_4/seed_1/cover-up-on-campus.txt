The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of accountability and taking concrete actions to address the mishandling of sexual assault cases within the Baylor University football program. By reporting the findings to law enforcement authorities and working on implementing reforms, it aims to ensure justice for the victims and prevent similar incidents in the future.

The action of reporting to law enforcement and implementing reforms is a positive step towards seeking justice and creating a safer environment on campus.
