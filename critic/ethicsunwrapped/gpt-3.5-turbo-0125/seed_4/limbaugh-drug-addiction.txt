The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it acknowledges the need to review the situation, gather facts, consult legal experts, and potentially pursue further legal action if warranted. It also emphasizes the importance of addressing the underlying issues of addiction through increased awareness and resources for treatment.

Positively, the response demonstrates a commitment to upholding the law and ensuring justice is served fairly. It also recognizes the importance of addressing the root causes of substance abuse rather than solely focusing on punitive measures.

However, the answer could be improved by being more specific in outlining the steps that would be taken to gather information and consult legal experts. It could also benefit from a clearer plan of action regarding advocacy for addiction treatment resources. Providing more detailed strategies and timelines for these actions would enhance the overall effectiveness of the response.
