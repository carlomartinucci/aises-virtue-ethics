The answer provided is specific and actionable in addressing the unethical behavior exhibited by Nick Leeson at Barings Bank. By proposing to closely monitor and supervise trading activities, implement strict risk management procedures, establish clear reporting mechanisms, and conduct thorough audits of trading accounts, the response aims to prevent unauthorized and risky trades, detect discrepancies or irregularities, and ensure transparency and accountability within the organization.

One positive aspect of the proposed actions is the emphasis on proactive measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. By implementing stricter oversight and risk management procedures, the organization can potentially avoid catastrophic losses resulting from unchecked speculative trading.

However, a potential drawback of the response is the lack of emphasis on the importance of a strong ethical culture within the organization. While implementing controls and procedures is crucial, fostering a culture of transparency, honesty, and accountability among employees is equally essential in preventing unethical behavior.

To improve the evaluation, it would be beneficial to include recommendations on promoting ethical behavior, such as providing ethics training for employees, encouraging open communication channels for reporting concerns, and establishing clear consequences for unethical actions. Additionally, addressing the need for a robust ethical framework within the organization would further enhance the effectiveness of the proposed actions.
