The answer provided is ethical as it acknowledges the potential conflict between the social worker's religious beliefs and the duty to provide unbiased treatment to the client. By consulting with a supervisor or colleague and having an open conversation with the client about the concerns, the social worker is taking proactive steps to address the ethical dilemma.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on self-reflection and seeking guidance from experienced colleagues. This shows a willingness to confront personal biases and seek help in navigating difficult ethical situations. Additionally, the suggestion to have an open conversation with the client and offer assistance in finding a new therapist demonstrates a commitment to the client's well-being and ensuring they receive appropriate care.

However, one area for improvement could be to explore additional options beyond transferring the client to another therapist. While this may be a valid solution in some cases, further discussion or exploration of alternative approaches that could allow the social worker to continue providing effective treatment while respecting the client's needs and beliefs would enhance the ethical response.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable approach to addressing the ethical dilemma, but could benefit from considering a wider range of potential solutions before deciding to transfer the client.
