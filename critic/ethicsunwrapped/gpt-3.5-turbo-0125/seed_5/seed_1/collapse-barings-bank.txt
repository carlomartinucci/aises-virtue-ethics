The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on taking immediate and decisive actions upon discovering the hidden losses and the extent of the problem caused by Nick Leeson's actions. The proposed steps, such as convening a crisis meeting, contacting regulatory authorities, informing stakeholders transparently, and considering legal action against Leeson, demonstrate a commitment to accountability, transparency, and seeking justice.

One positive aspect is the emphasis on swift action and collaboration with relevant parties to address the situation effectively. By involving senior executives, legal counsel, regulatory authorities, and stakeholders, the response shows a comprehensive approach to managing the crisis.

However, a potential improvement could be to include a more detailed plan for internal investigations to identify any systemic issues or failures in oversight that allowed Leeson's actions to go unnoticed. Developing a thorough understanding of the root causes can help prevent similar incidents in the future.

Overall, the response provides a strong foundation for dealing with a crisis of this magnitude, but further detail on internal investigations and preventative measures could enhance its effectiveness in addressing the ethical and operational implications of the situation.
