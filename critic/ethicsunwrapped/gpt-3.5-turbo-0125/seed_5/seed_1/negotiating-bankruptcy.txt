On the positive side, the answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the ethical duty to disclose relevant information that could impact the fairness and impartiality of legal proceedings.

However, it would have been beneficial to also mention the potential consequences of non-disclosure, such as legal repercussions and damage to professional reputation. Additionally, offering practical steps on how to navigate the situation after disclosure, such as seeking independent counsel for BE or recusing oneself from the case, would have enhanced the answer's practicality and actionable guidance.

Overall, the response provides a solid ethical foundation by emphasizing the importance of disclosure and transparency, but it could be improved by including a discussion of the consequences of non-disclosure and offering actionable steps to address the situation effectively.
