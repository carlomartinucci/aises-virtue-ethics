The response acknowledges the importance of reflecting on personal biases and seeking guidance from a supervisor or colleague, which is a good first step in addressing the ethical dilemma. Referring the client to another therapist who can provide unbiased support is a practical solution that prioritizes the client's well-being. However, the response could be improved by suggesting additional actions such as exploring the possibility of continuing to work with the client while actively working to set aside personal beliefs during sessions, or seeking additional training or supervision to better navigate similar situations in the future. Overall, the response is ethical in its consideration of the client's needs but could be more comprehensive in exploring alternative approaches to handling the situation.
