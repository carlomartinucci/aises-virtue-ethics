Your answer is specific and actionable, focusing on conducting a review of Ellen Pao's performance reviews and evaluations to understand the criticisms and feedback she received during her time at Kleiner Perkins. This approach is practical as it aims to analyze the consistency of these reviews to identify any patterns or discrepancies in the feedback provided to her. By examining the evidence presented during the trial related to Pao's performance and character, you seek to gain insights into how her performance was evaluated and whether biases or inconsistencies existed in the review process.

To improve your evaluation, consider also suggesting conducting interviews with current and former employees of Kleiner Perkins who worked closely with Pao to gather additional perspectives on her performance, character, and interactions within the company. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics at play and help assess the validity of the criticisms raised against Pao. Additionally, proposing a review of the firm's HR policies and practices to evaluate the procedures in place for addressing discrimination and harassment concerns would offer a broader perspective on the organizational culture and potential areas for improvement.
