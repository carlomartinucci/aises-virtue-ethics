The answer provided is ethical, as it emphasizes the importance of reporting the situation to the appropriate authorities within the university, such as the Title IX office or the university administration. It also highlights the need to provide all relevant information and evidence to ensure proper investigations are conducted and appropriate actions are taken to address reports of sexual assault and misconduct involving football players.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting additional steps that could have been taken, such as offering support to the victims of sexual assault, advocating for policy changes to prevent future incidents, and promoting a culture of accountability within the football program and university as a whole. These actions would help address the root causes of the issue and work towards creating a safer and more responsible environment for all students.

Overall, the answer provides a good starting point for addressing the situation but could benefit from a more comprehensive and proactive approach to addressing the systemic failures that allowed such misconduct to occur and persist.
