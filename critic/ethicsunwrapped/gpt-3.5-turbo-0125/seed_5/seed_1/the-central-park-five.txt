The answer provided is ethical and actionable. By advocating for criminal justice reforms such as mandatory recording of interrogations, promoting proper police training on interrogation techniques, and pushing for legislation requiring physical evidence for convictions, the response addresses the root causes of wrongful convictions. Furthermore, supporting initiatives to educate the public on false confessions and the significance of concrete evidence in criminal cases helps create awareness and prevent similar injustices.

However, the evaluation could be improved by suggesting additional steps to ensure accountability for those involved in the wrongful conviction of the Central Park Five. This could include advocating for disciplinary actions against the lead prosecutor, head detective, and individuals who failed to acknowledge the innocence of the wrongfully convicted men despite overwhelming evidence. Holding individuals accountable for their actions can help prevent similar miscarriages of justice in the future and promote a more just legal system.
