The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it prioritizes the well-being of the victim and accountability for the perpetrator by advocating for immediate reporting to authorities and initiating an internal investigation. This response acknowledges the gravity of the situation and the importance of taking concrete steps to address the issue and prevent further harm.

However, one potential improvement could be to also emphasize the importance of transparency and accountability within the university setting, ensuring that all individuals involved are held responsible for their actions or inactions. This could involve not only reporting to authorities but also holding discussions with university leadership to address systemic failures and ensure that proper protocols are in place to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Overall, while the response is commendable for prioritizing the victim's well-being and advocating for accountability, further emphasis on transparency and addressing systemic issues within the university could enhance the ethical evaluation.
