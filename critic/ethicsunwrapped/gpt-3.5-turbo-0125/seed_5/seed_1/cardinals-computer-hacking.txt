The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it emphasizes the importance of reporting the unethical behavior to the appropriate authorities and cooperating fully with investigations. By advocating for following proper procedures and upholding the integrity of the sport, the answer aligns with ethical principles of accountability and transparency.

However, the answer lacks specificity in terms of addressing potential preventative measures that could have been taken to avoid such incidents in the first place. It does not delve into the importance of implementing robust cybersecurity measures or educating employees on the consequences of unauthorized access to information. Furthermore, while reporting the incident is crucial, a more comprehensive approach could involve discussing the significance of setting clear boundaries and ethical standards within an organization to prevent such breaches from occurring.

In summary, while the response is ethical in its call for reporting the misconduct, it could be enhanced by including actionable steps for preventing similar incidents in the future, such as implementing stricter access controls and fostering a culture of ethical behavior within the organization.
