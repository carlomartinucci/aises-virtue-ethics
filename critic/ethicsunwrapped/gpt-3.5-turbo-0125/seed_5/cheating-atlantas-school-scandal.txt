The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of maintaining integrity and upholding ethical standards in education. By suggesting alternative strategies to support the students, such as providing additional tutoring and academic support, the response shows a commitment to helping students succeed genuinely.

One positive aspect of the answer is the willingness to address the issue directly with the principal and offer alternative solutions. This proactive approach demonstrates a sense of responsibility and a desire to find ethical ways to support the students.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of consideration for the potential consequences of refusing to change the test answers. While it is important to uphold ethical standards, the answer could benefit from addressing how to navigate the challenging situation if the principal insists on altering the answers despite objections.

Overall, the response provides a good starting point for addressing the ethical dilemma in a constructive and principled manner. It could be strengthened by considering the potential outcomes of the conversation with the principal and how to proceed if there is resistance to the proposed alternatives.
