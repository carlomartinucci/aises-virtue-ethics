The answer provided acknowledges the complexity of the situation and the strong emotions involved, which is a good starting point. Prioritizing transparency, open communication, and listening to the public's concerns are positive steps towards rebuilding trust. Committing to providing regular updates and information, along with explaining the rationale behind decisions, is crucial for fostering transparency. Additionally, focusing on addressing pressing national issues like the Vietnam War demonstrates a commitment to moving forward.

However, the answer lacks specific actions that could have been taken to address the public's anger and suspicions regarding the Nixon pardon. It could have benefitted from outlining concrete steps such as establishing an independent investigation to ensure accountability, engaging in dialogue with key stakeholders to address their concerns directly, or implementing reforms to prevent similar situations in the future. These actionable measures would have shown a proactive approach to addressing the public's grievances and rebuilding trust effectively.

Overall, while the answer demonstrates a willingness to engage with the public and prioritize transparency, it falls short in providing specific and actionable steps to address the underlying issues surrounding the Nixon pardon and the public's dissatisfaction. Adding more concrete actions would have strengthened the response and enhanced its effectiveness in rebuilding trust with the American people.
