Your response to the scenario is specific and actionable. By suggesting a thorough review of the financial records and documents presented during the trial, you aim to verify the accuracy of Kozlowski's claim, which is a practical step in evaluating the situation. This approach demonstrates a commitment to fact-checking and ensuring transparency in assessing the case.

One potential improvement would be to also consider conducting interviews or seeking additional evidence beyond the courtroom proceedings to gain a comprehensive understanding of the situation. This would provide a more holistic perspective and help in making a well-informed judgment.

Overall, your response is practical and focused on gathering concrete evidence to assess the validity of Kozlowski's defense, which is commendable. Expanding the scope of investigation to include other sources of information could further enhance the evaluation process.
