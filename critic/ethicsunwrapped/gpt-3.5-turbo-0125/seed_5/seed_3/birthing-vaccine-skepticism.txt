By providing evidence and documentation to support the report, the individual is acting responsibly to ensure a thorough examination of the situation. This approach can contribute to maintaining trust in the medical profession and safeguarding the integrity of scientific research.

However, to further strengthen the ethical response, it would be beneficial to also consider reaching out to affected parties, such as the families of the children involved in Wakefield's study, to offer support, address any concerns, and provide accurate information regarding vaccination. Engaging with the community affected by Wakefield's actions can help rebuild trust and mitigate the negative impact of misinformation spread by his discredited theory.
