The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it emphasizes the importance of reporting the incident to the proper authorities and ensuring a thorough investigation within the university. By taking these steps, the focus is on protecting the victim and holding the perpetrator accountable, which aligns with ethical principles of justice and responsibility.

Additionally, the answer could have mentioned the importance of prioritizing the well-being of the victims and ensuring their support and protection throughout the process.

Overall, the answer is on the right track in terms of ethical considerations, but it could be enhanced by providing more specific and actionable steps, as well as emphasizing the urgency and sensitivity required in handling such a serious matter.
