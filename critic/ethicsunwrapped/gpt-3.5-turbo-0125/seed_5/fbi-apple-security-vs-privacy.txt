The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing the scenario. It acknowledges the court order compelling Apple to assist the FBI and emphasizes the importance of national security and gathering critical information related to the terrorist attack. The response also highlights the need for collaboration between Apple and the FBI, as well as the importance of transparency in addressing privacy concerns.

However, the answer lacks a thorough evaluation of the ethical implications involved. While it focuses on the legal aspect and the necessity of complying with the court order, it does not delve into the broader ethical considerations raised by Apple and its supporters regarding individual privacy, free speech rights, and the potential risks associated with creating a backdoor that could compromise the privacy of all iPhone users.

To improve the evaluation, the response could have included a more balanced analysis of the ethical arguments presented by both sides, weighing the competing values of national security, individual privacy, free speech rights, and the potential consequences of setting a precedent for government overreach into private technology companies.

Overall, the answer provides a practical course of action but falls short in fully evaluating the ethical complexities of the scenario.
