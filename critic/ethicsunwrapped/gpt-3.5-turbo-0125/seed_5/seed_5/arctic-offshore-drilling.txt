The answer provided is ethical as it promotes environmental stewardship and the consideration of potential risks to the ecosystem and indigenous communities. It emphasizes the importance of conducting a thorough environmental impact assessment to evaluate the potential consequences of offshore drilling in the Arctic. This approach aligns with principles of responsible decision-making and sustainability.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing the broader context of the issue. It would be beneficial to also consider alternative energy sources and the long-term implications of continuing to rely on fossil fuels. Additionally, the response could suggest engaging with stakeholders, including environmental organizations and indigenous communities, to ensure a more comprehensive and inclusive evaluation process.

In conclusion, while the answer is ethical in its emphasis on environmental impact assessment, it could be strengthened by incorporating a more holistic approach that considers alternative energy solutions and engages with a wider range of stakeholders.
