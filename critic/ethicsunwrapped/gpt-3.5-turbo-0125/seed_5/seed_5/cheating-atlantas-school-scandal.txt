The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it advocates for open communication and suggests alternative strategies to support students without compromising integrity. By addressing the issue directly with the principal and proposing constructive solutions, the response demonstrates a commitment to ethical behavior and prioritizing the well-being of the students.

However, the answer could be improved by being more proactive in seeking out support from higher authorities or reporting the unethical behavior to prevent further misconduct. Additionally, a more comprehensive plan for addressing the situation and ensuring academic success for the students could have been outlined in the response.

Overall, the answer is a good starting point by emphasizing the importance of ethical conduct and student well-being, but it could benefit from a more assertive approach in handling the situation and providing a detailed plan of action.
