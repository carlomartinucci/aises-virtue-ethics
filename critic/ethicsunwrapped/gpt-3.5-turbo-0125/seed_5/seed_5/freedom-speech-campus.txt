The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it emphasizes prioritizing the safety and well-being of the students involved in the protests, facilitating open dialogues to address racial tensions, and advocating for a more inclusive campus environment. It also acknowledges the importance of free speech and respectful dialogue while educating students on these principles.

One positive aspect of the response is the proactive approach to engaging with student activists and working towards concrete actions to address systemic racism and discrimination. By listening to their perspectives and advocating for their voices to be heard, the answer demonstrates a commitment to fostering a supportive environment for students of color.

However, a potential area for improvement could be the need for more specific and actionable steps to address the issues raised in the scenario. While facilitating dialogues and educating students on free speech are important, concrete measures such as implementing diversity initiatives, cultural competency training, and support services could have a more significant impact in creating a more inclusive campus environment.

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for addressing the complex issues related to the protests but could benefit from more detailed and actionable strategies to effectively address racial tensions and promote social justice on campus.
