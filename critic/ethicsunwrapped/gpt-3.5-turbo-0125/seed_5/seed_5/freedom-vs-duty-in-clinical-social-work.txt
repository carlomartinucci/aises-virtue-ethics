The answer provided is ethical as it demonstrates a willingness to acknowledge personal biases, seek guidance from a supervisor or colleague, and prioritize the client's well-being by considering a referral to another therapist if necessary. This approach aligns with the ethical principles outlined by the National Association of Social Workers, emphasizing the importance of preventing discrimination and providing optimal service to clients.

Positively, the response shows a commitment to self-reflection and seeking support from others to navigate ethical dilemmas effectively. By considering a transfer to another therapist, the focus remains on the client's needs and ensuring they receive appropriate care without any conflicts of interest.

However, a potential improvement could be to explicitly mention exploring options for ongoing support for the client during the transition to a new therapist. This would ensure continuity of care and demonstrate a holistic approach to addressing the client's mental health needs.

Overall, the response effectively addresses the ethical concerns raised in the scenario by prioritizing the client's well-being and seeking guidance to navigate potential conflicts of interest.
