The answer provided addresses the need for transparency, open communication, and rebuilding trust with the public, which are positive steps in handling the aftermath of the Nixon pardon. Acknowledging the complexity of the situation and prioritizing listening to public concerns are good practices. Additionally, committing to providing regular updates and explaining decisions can help foster understanding and potentially rebuild trust.

However, the answer lacks specificity in terms of concrete actions to address the public's frustrations and concerns effectively. It could be more actionable by outlining specific ways to engage with the public, such as holding town hall meetings, appointing an independent commission to investigate the pardon process, or establishing mechanisms for oversight to ensure accountability moving forward. Providing more detailed steps would enhance the practicality of the response and demonstrate a stronger commitment to rebuilding trust with the American people.
