The answer provided is quite ethical as it prioritizes the safety and well-being of the students involved in the protests and aims to facilitate open dialogues to address racial tensions on campus. By advocating for inclusive and supportive campus environments, actively listening to student perspectives, and encouraging concrete actions to combat racism, the response demonstrates a commitment to social justice and equality.

However, the answer could be improved by offering more specific strategies for implementing diversity initiatives, cultural competency training, and support services for marginalized students. Providing detailed steps on how to engage with student leaders, collaborate with university stakeholders, and ensure the sustainability of these initiatives would enhance the practicality of the response. Additionally, addressing the complexities of balancing free speech with respectful dialogue and media coverage could be further elaborated upon to offer actionable solutions for navigating these challenges effectively.
