The answer provided is ethical as it demonstrates a thoughtful and responsible approach to addressing the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. By acknowledging personal biases and seeking guidance from a supervisor or colleague, the social worker is taking steps to ensure that the client's well-being is prioritized and that they receive the best possible care. Referring the client to another therapist who can provide unbiased support is a proactive and appropriate solution to the conflict of interest.

One positive aspect of the response is the emphasis on self-reflection and seeking guidance from others with more experience in dealing with ethical dilemmas. This shows a willingness to confront personal biases and prioritize the client's needs above personal beliefs.

However, one area for improvement could be to also consider discussing the situation with the client directly before making a decision to transfer them to another therapist. Open communication with the client about the potential conflict of interest and exploring their comfort level with continuing therapy with the social worker could lead to a more collaborative and client-centered resolution.

Overall, the response provides a practical and actionable approach to addressing the ethical dilemma, but could benefit from further exploration of involving the client in the decision-making process.
