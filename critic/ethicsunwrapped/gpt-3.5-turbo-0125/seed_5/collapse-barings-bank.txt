The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes transparency, accountability, and cooperation with regulatory authorities in addressing the crisis caused by Nick Leeson's actions at Barings Bank. The immediate convening of a crisis meeting, informing regulatory authorities, and preparing a communication strategy are all positive steps in handling the situation responsibly.

However, the answer could be improved by including a more proactive approach to risk management and oversight. It would have been beneficial to highlight the importance of implementing stronger internal controls and risk management practices to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. Additionally, the answer could have addressed the need for a thorough investigation into the failures in supervision and risk assessment that allowed Leeson's actions to go unchecked for so long.

Overall, the response is practical and actionable in terms of crisis management and communication, but could have been more specific in addressing the need for systemic changes within the organization to prevent similar incidents in the future.
