The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it advocates for conducting further research and seeking out expert opinions to gain a deeper understanding of the ethical considerations surrounding the issue of sports-related concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in NFL players. By reviewing reputable studies, analyzing methodologies, and consulting with professionals in relevant fields, the individual can form a more informed opinion on the morality of supporting football as a spectator sport.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting specific actions that can be taken based on the findings of the research and consultations. For example, recommending potential changes or interventions that could be implemented to mitigate the risks associated with football-related brain injuries would make the response more actionable and practical. Additionally, addressing the potential implications of the findings on personal behavior or advocacy for policy changes would enhance the overall evaluation.
