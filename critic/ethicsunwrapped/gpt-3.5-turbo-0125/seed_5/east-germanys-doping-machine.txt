The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being and health of the affected athletes, acknowledges the physical and psychological consequences of the doping, and emphasizes providing comprehensive medical care, counseling services, legal support, and raising awareness about the unethical practices to prevent future incidents.

Positively, the response focuses on addressing the immediate needs of the athletes by providing medical care and counseling, which is crucial for their physical and mental recovery. Offering legal support for those seeking justice or compensation is also commendable as it empowers the athletes to take action against the harm they suffered. Furthermore, raising awareness about the unethical practices serves to educate others and prevent similar incidents in the future, promoting fair competition in sports.

However, the answer could be improved by specifying concrete steps to ensure the comprehensive medical care and counseling services are tailored to the specific conditions resulting from the doping. Providing details on how legal support would be facilitated and ensuring the athletes' rights are protected in seeking justice would enhance the practicality of the response. Additionally, outlining specific strategies for raising awareness, such as educational campaigns or collaborations with sports organizations, would strengthen the overall approach to preventing future unethical practices in sports.
