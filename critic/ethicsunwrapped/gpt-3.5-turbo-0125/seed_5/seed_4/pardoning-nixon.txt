The answer provided acknowledges the complexity of the situation and the strong emotions involved, which is a positive aspect. It also emphasizes transparency, open communication, and rebuilding trust with the public, which are all important steps in addressing the concerns arising from the pardon.

However, the response lacks specific actions that could have been taken to address the public's anger and suspicions more effectively. It could have included concrete initiatives such as appointing an independent investigator to review the pardon decision, engaging in town hall meetings with the public to hear their concerns directly, or implementing reforms to prevent similar situations in the future.

Overall, while the answer shows an awareness of the need for communication and transparency, it could have been more actionable by providing specific steps to address the public's grievances and work towards rebuilding trust in the government.
