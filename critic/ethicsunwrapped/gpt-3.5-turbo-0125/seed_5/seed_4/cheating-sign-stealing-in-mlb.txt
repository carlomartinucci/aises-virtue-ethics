The answer provided is ethical as it aligns with the principles of fairness, honesty, and integrity. By reporting the sign-stealing scheme to Major League Baseball (MLB) officials, the individual is taking a proactive step to address the cheating scandal and uphold the integrity of the game. This action demonstrates a commitment to ethical conduct and accountability.

However, a more comprehensive evaluation would include specific steps on how to report the scheme effectively. It would be beneficial to gather all evidence and documentation related to the "Codebreaker" system, such as emails, presentations, and witness testimonies, to provide a thorough account of the wrongdoing. Additionally, ensuring confidentiality and protection for whistleblowers should also be considered to encourage others to come forward with information.

Overall, while the answer is ethical in its intention to report the misconduct, it could be enhanced by specifying detailed steps to take in reporting the sign-stealing scheme to MLB officials and ensuring that appropriate measures are implemented to address the issue effectively.
