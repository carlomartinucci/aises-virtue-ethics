The answer provided is quite ethical in the sense that it emphasizes following legal advice and collaborating with the institution's ethics committee to ensure proper handling of the situation. It also highlights the importance of enhancing transparency in research practices to avoid similar issues in the future. These actions show a commitment to upholding ethical standards and improving research integrity within the institution.

However, the response could benefit from more specific actions that can be taken to address the situation effectively. For instance, it would be helpful to outline concrete steps for reviewing and potentially updating research integrity policies and procedures based on the investigation findings. Additionally, providing examples of how transparency can be enhanced in research practices, such as implementing open data policies or requiring detailed documentation of experimental protocols, would make the answer more actionable.

Overall, while the answer demonstrates a consideration for ethical principles and a commitment to addressing the issue at hand, it could be improved by offering more specific and practical steps to navigate the complexities of the case and prevent similar incidents in the future.
