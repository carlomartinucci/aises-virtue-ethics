Your answer is specific and actionable, focusing on the verification of financial records and documents presented during the trial to assess the accuracy of Kozlowski's claims. By reviewing this evidence and consulting financial experts if necessary, you aim to determine the validity of his defense. This approach is practical and directly addresses the issue at hand by seeking to uncover the truth based on factual information.

One positive aspect of your response is its emphasis on concrete actions, such as analyzing evidence and cross-referencing financial statements, which can lead to a more informed evaluation of the situation. This approach is essential for ensuring a fair and thorough assessment of Kozlowski's claims.

However, one potential drawback is the lack of consideration for potential biases or conflicts of interest that may arise during the review process. It is crucial to maintain objectivity and transparency throughout the investigation to uphold ethical standards and avoid any perception of partiality.

To enhance your evaluation further, you could also suggest involving independent auditors or regulatory bodies to provide an additional layer of oversight and credibility to the review process. This would help validate the findings and ensure accountability in the pursuit of uncovering the truth regarding Kozlowski's defense.

Overall, your response provides a practical and specific approach to assessing the accuracy of Kozlowski's claims, but it would benefit from incorporating measures to address potential biases and involve external oversight for increased transparency and credibility.
