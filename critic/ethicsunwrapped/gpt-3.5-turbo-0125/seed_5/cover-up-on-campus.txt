The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes reporting the situation to the appropriate authorities within the university, ensuring proper investigations are conducted, and prioritizing the safety and well-being of all students. By taking these actions, the answer aligns with ethical principles of accountability, transparency, and prioritizing the welfare of individuals affected by the misconduct.

However, the answer could be improved by also mentioning the importance of actively supporting and advocating for the victims of sexual assault and misconduct, ensuring they receive appropriate care, resources, and protection. Additionally, it would be beneficial to address the need for implementing preventive measures and educational programs to create a safer campus environment and prevent future incidents.

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for addressing the ethical issues in the scenario, but could be enhanced by including a more comprehensive approach that focuses on supporting victims, prevention strategies, and fostering a culture of accountability and safety within the university community.
