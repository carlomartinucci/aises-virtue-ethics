The answer provided acknowledges the complexity of the situation and the emotions involved, which is a good starting point. Prioritizing transparency, open communication, and listening to the public's concerns are positive steps towards rebuilding trust. Committing to providing regular updates and explaining decisions can help foster understanding and credibility. Addressing pressing national issues like the Vietnam War shows a proactive approach to moving forward.

However, the answer lacks specific actions or strategies on how to address the public's anger and suspicions regarding the pardon. It could benefit from outlining concrete steps to address these concerns, such as establishing an independent investigation or commission to review the pardon decision. Additionally, while focusing on national issues is important, more emphasis could be placed on ensuring accountability and justice for past wrongdoings to uphold the rule of law and restore public confidence in the government.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a good intention to rebuild trust and move forward but could be strengthened by providing more specific actions to address public concerns and ensure accountability in the aftermath of the pardon.
