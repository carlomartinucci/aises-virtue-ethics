The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it emphasizes the importance of reporting Chris Correa's actions to the appropriate authorities and cooperating fully with investigations. By doing so, it upholds the integrity of the sport and ensures that the breach of security and theft of information are addressed through proper legal channels.

However, the answer lacks specificity in terms of addressing potential preventive measures that could have been taken to avoid such incidents in the first place. It would have been beneficial to mention the importance of implementing robust cybersecurity measures, conducting regular audits, and providing training on data security to prevent unauthorized access.

Furthermore, the answer could have highlighted the significance of ethical behavior and respect for intellectual property rights within the sports industry. Emphasizing the consequences of engaging in unethical practices, such as hacking and stealing information, would have reinforced the message of maintaining integrity and fair play in sports.

In conclusion, while the answer is ethical in its focus on reporting the incident and cooperating with investigations, it could have been more actionable by including preventive measures and emphasizing the broader ethical implications of such actions in the sports industry.
