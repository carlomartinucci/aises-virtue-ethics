This approach demonstrates a proactive effort to understand the specific actions taken by Apple to address the ethical concerns in their supply chain.

On the positive side, the answer emphasizes the importance of gathering detailed information from reliable sources such as annual reports and directly contacting the relevant teams within Apple.
