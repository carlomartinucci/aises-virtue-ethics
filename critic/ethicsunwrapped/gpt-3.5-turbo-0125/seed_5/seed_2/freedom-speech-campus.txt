The answer provided is fairly ethical as it emphasizes prioritizing the safety and well-being of the students involved in the protests, facilitating dialogues to address racial tensions, and advocating for a more inclusive campus environment. The actions suggested, such as working with campus security, engaging in open dialogues, and implementing concrete measures to combat racism, are practical and actionable steps to address the issues at hand.

However, the response could benefit from more specific details on how exactly to ensure the safety of the students, what kind of dialogues to facilitate, and what specific actions to take to combat systemic racism on campus. Providing concrete examples or strategies, such as organizing diversity training programs, creating safe spaces for dialogue, or establishing support networks for marginalized students, would enhance the effectiveness of the proposed actions.

Overall, while the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the ethical considerations in the given scenario, adding more specific and actionable steps would further strengthen the response.
