The answer provided is quite ethical as it addresses the importance of individual moral responsibility and the ability to make choices, even in challenging situations. By focusing on creating awareness and education through workshops and training programs that tackle moral courage and the power of individual decisions, it aims to empower individuals to understand the consequences of their actions and promote ethical decision-making. The emphasis on fostering a culture that values standing up for what is right is commendable as it seeks to prevent similar atrocities from happening in the future.
