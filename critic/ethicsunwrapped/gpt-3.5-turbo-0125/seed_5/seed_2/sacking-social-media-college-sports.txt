The recommendation to implement a social media policy for college athletes with clear guidelines and consequences for violations is a practical and actionable step in addressing the ethical considerations surrounding social media use in college sports. By providing social media training and education, athletes can better understand the impact of their online presence, promoting responsible behavior online. Regular monitoring of social media accounts using software like UDiligence is a proactive approach to identifying and addressing problematic behavior promptly.

However, the evaluation could be improved by emphasizing the importance of striking a balance between regulating social media use and allowing athletes some degree of freedom of expression. It would be beneficial to highlight the need for transparency and fairness in enforcing the policy, ensuring that consequences are applied consistently and in a manner that respects the athletes' rights.

Additionally, the evaluation could have mentioned the importance of fostering a culture of accountability and respect within the athletic program to complement the social media policy. Encouraging open communication channels for athletes to discuss any concerns or challenges they may face regarding social media use can further support their development and ethical decision-making in this context.
