The answer provided is ethical as it demonstrates a clear recognition of the potential conflict between the social worker's personal beliefs and their professional duty to provide unbiased care to the client. The response outlines practical steps such as acknowledging personal biases, seeking consultation, and potentially referring the client to another therapist if necessary. These actions prioritize the client's well-being and ensure that they receive appropriate care.

However, the answer could be strengthened by providing more specific details on how the social worker could engage in self-reflection to identify and address their biases effectively. Additionally, offering concrete examples of potential strategies for seeking guidance from a supervisor or colleague would enhance the response's practicality.

Overall, the answer is good in highlighting the importance of addressing ethical dilemmas in social work practice and taking proactive steps to ensure the client's needs are met. By incorporating more specific strategies for self-reflection and seeking guidance, the response could be even more actionable and effective.
