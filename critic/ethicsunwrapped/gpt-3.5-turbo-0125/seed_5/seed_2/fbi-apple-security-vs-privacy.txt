The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing the scenario at hand. It acknowledges the court order compelling Apple to assist the FBI and emphasizes the importance of national security and gathering critical information related to the terrorist attack. The response also highlights the need for transparency and clear communication between Apple and the FBI during the collaboration process.

One positive aspect of the answer is the recognition of the legal framework and the importance of complying with court orders. By prioritizing national security concerns and facilitating communication between the involved parties, the response aims to address the immediate challenges posed by the situation.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of consideration for the broader ethical implications raised by Apple and its supporters regarding individual privacy and the potential consequences of creating a backdoor for accessing encrypted devices. The answer could benefit from a more nuanced evaluation of these ethical concerns and a discussion on how to navigate the balance between privacy rights and national security imperatives in a more detailed manner.

In conclusion, while the response provides a practical course of action within the existing legal context, it could be enhanced by a deeper examination of the ethical dilemmas at play and the long-term implications of the decisions made in this scenario.
