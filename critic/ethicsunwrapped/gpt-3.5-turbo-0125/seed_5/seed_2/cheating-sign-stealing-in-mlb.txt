The answer provided is ethical as it involves reporting the sign-stealing scheme to the appropriate authorities, which aligns with upholding the integrity of the game and ensuring fair play. By reporting the misconduct to MLB officials, the individual is taking a proactive step to address the cheating scandal and prevent further unethical behavior.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting additional actions that could be taken to address the aftermath of the scandal. For example, the individual could recommend implementing stricter regulations or monitoring systems to prevent future instances of sign-stealing. They could also propose measures to restore trust and credibility within the league, such as public apologies or initiatives to rebuild the reputation of the sport.

Overall, while the initial action of reporting the sign-stealing scheme is commendable, suggesting further steps to address the broader implications of the scandal would enhance the ethical response.
