The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of reporting the information to the appropriate authorities and ensuring the victim receives support. By prioritizing the safety and well-being of the victim, the answer aligns with ethical principles of protecting individuals from harm and seeking justice for victims of abuse. Taking swift and decisive action in such situations is crucial to prevent further harm and hold perpetrators accountable.

However, the answer could be improved by also mentioning the importance of holding the individuals who were aware of the abuse accountable for their inaction. It is essential to address the systemic failures and lack of response from those in positions of power, such as Joe Paterno, Graham Spanier, Gary Schultz, and Tim Curley, who failed to take appropriate action despite being aware of the abuse. Holding these individuals accountable is necessary to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future and to ensure justice for the victims.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and actionable response to the scenario, focusing on the immediate steps that should have been taken to address the abuse. By incorporating accountability for those who failed to act, the answer could be further strengthened in addressing the ethical complexities of the situation.
