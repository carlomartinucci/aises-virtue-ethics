The proposed action of publicly acknowledging Marvin Gaye's influence and collaborating with his family to create a tribute project is ethical. It demonstrates respect for Gaye's legacy and recognizes the importance of artistic influence in music. By expressing a willingness to collaborate, Thicke and Williams would be taking responsibility for their actions and showing that they value the contributions of other artists. 

Additionally, proposing a charitable donation to a foundation supported by the Gaye family further emphasizes their commitment to honoring Gaye's impact on music and culture. This action not only seeks to mend relationships but also contributes positively to the community and the arts. 

Overall, the response is specific and practical, focusing on actions that promote recognition, collaboration, and goodwill, which are ethical considerations in the context of this scenario.
