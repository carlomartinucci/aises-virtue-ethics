The proposed actions in the scenario are ethical and demonstrate a commitment to accountability and transparency. Initiating an independent audit of Tyco International's financial practices and executive compensation policies addresses the core issues raised by the allegations against Dennis Kozlowski. 

1. **Review of Executive Compensation**: This step is crucial as it directly addresses concerns about whether executive pay was justified and aligned with shareholder interests. Ensuring that compensation packages are fair and transparent is a fundamental aspect of corporate governance.

2. **Examine Corporate Governance**: Assessing the board's effectiveness is essential to determine if there were lapses in oversight that allowed for the alleged misconduct. This promotes a culture of responsibility and checks and balances within the organization.

3. **Investigate Financial Transactions**: Scrutinizing the financial records related to the unauthorized bonuses and personal expenses is necessary to establish the legitimacy of these transactions. This step is vital for uncovering any potential wrongdoing and ensuring accountability.

4. **Report Findings**: Compiling a comprehensive report ensures that stakeholders are informed of the audit's outcomes, fostering transparency and trust in the company's leadership.

5. **Implement Recommendations**: Taking action based on the audit findings demonstrates a proactive approach to rectify any identified issues and improve corporate governance practices.

Overall, the actions proposed are specific, practical, and aimed at addressing the ethical concerns raised in the scenario. They promote accountability and transparency, which are essential for restoring trust in the company's leadership.
