The proposed action of granting a conditional pardon to Nixon, contingent upon his cooperation with a full investigation into the Watergate scandal, is a more ethical approach than Ford's unconditional pardon. This decision acknowledges the public's demand for accountability while also considering the need for national healing. 

By requiring Nixon to testify and provide documents, it ensures that he would be held accountable for his actions, addressing the concerns of many Americans who felt that justice was not served. This approach balances the interests of moving forward as a nation with the necessity of transparency and accountability in government. 

Additionally, it respects the constitutional duty of the presidency to uphold the rule of law while also considering the practical implications of Nixon's health. Overall, this response demonstrates a commitment to ethical governance by seeking to reconcile the need for justice with the desire for national unity. 

In summary, the answer is ethical as it seeks to uphold accountability while also considering the broader implications for the nation.
