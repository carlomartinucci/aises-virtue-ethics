The proposed answer is ethical as it emphasizes education and support rather than punitive measures. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its ethical considerations:

1. **Education Focus**: The implementation of a structured social media education program prioritizes teaching athletes about the risks and benefits of social media. This empowers them to make informed decisions rather than simply restricting their freedom.

2. **Mandatory Workshops**: By organizing workshops, the approach ensures that all athletes receive the same foundational knowledge, promoting fairness and equal opportunity to learn about responsible social media use.

3. **Guest Speakers**: Inviting experienced individuals to share their insights adds credibility to the program and provides real-world context, which can be more impactful than theoretical discussions alone.

4. **Clear Guidelines**: Developing specific social media guidelines helps set clear expectations for behavior, which is essential for accountability while still allowing for personal expression.

5. **Ongoing Support**: Establishing a support system for athletes to seek advice fosters an environment of trust and mentorship, encouraging open communication about social media challenges.

6. **Monitoring with Purpose**: The proposal to monitor social media activity for constructive feedback rather than punishment aligns with a mentoring approach, focusing on growth and learning rather than fear of repercussions.

Overall, the answer promotes a balanced approach that respects athletes' freedom of expression while addressing the responsibilities that come with representing a university. It avoids draconian measures and instead fosters a culture of awareness and responsibility, making it an ethical response to the scenario.
