The proposed action of implementing a consumer education campaign at a local grocery store to address the issue of moral licensing associated with green product purchases is ethical. It demonstrates a proactive approach to informing consumers about the potential negative consequences of their purchasing behaviors, thereby promoting a more holistic understanding of ethical consumption.

The campaign's specific elements, such as clear signage and workshops, are practical and actionable. They aim to educate consumers on the concept of moral licensing and encourage them to reflect on their overall consumption habits. This not only raises awareness but also empowers consumers to make more informed choices, fostering a culture of responsibility and mindfulness in shopping.

By addressing the issue directly and providing resources for consumers to engage with, the initiative seeks to mitigate the unintended consequences of green consumerism. Overall, the approach is ethical as it prioritizes consumer education and encourages a balanced perspective on ethical consumption.
