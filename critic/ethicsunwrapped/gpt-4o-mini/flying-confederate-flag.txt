It promotes open communication and understanding, allowing individuals from both sides to express their views and experiences. This approach acknowledges the complexity of the issue and seeks to bridge divides rather than exacerbate them.

By including historians and community leaders, the forum would provide a well-rounded perspective on the historical and cultural significance of the flag, which is essential for informed discussions. Documenting the discussions and outcomes would also contribute to transparency and accountability, ensuring that the community's voices are heard and considered in future decisions.

Overall, this action prioritizes dialogue and education over confrontation, which is a responsible and ethical approach to addressing a contentious issue. It respects the diverse opinions within the community while aiming for a resolution that acknowledges the pain associated with the flag's symbolism.
