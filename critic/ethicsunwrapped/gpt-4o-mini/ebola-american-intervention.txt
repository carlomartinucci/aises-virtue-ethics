The proposed answer is ethical as it emphasizes a collaborative and multifaceted approach to addressing the Ebola crisis while respecting humanitarian principles and local autonomy. 

1. **Collaborative Task Force**: The establishment of a task force that includes military personnel, public health experts, and humanitarian organizations is a practical way to ensure that various perspectives and expertise are integrated into the response. This approach mitigates the risks associated with the militarization of humanitarian efforts by involving non-military stakeholders.

2. **Assessing Needs**: Conducting a rapid assessment of health care needs is crucial for effective intervention. This step ensures that resources are directed where they are most needed, which is both ethical and efficient.

3. **Resource Allocation**: Developing a clear plan for resource allocation that prioritizes treatment centers while upholding humanitarian principles demonstrates a commitment to ethical standards in crisis response.

4. **Training Local Health Workers**: Focusing on training local health care workers is a sustainable approach that empowers the local population and builds long-term capacity, rather than creating dependency on foreign military personnel.

5. **Community Engagement**: Engaging with local communities fosters trust and cooperation, which is essential for the success of any public health intervention. This step respects the autonomy of the local population and acknowledges their role in combating the epidemic.

6. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Setting up a system for monitoring and evaluation allows for accountability and adaptability in the intervention, ensuring that it remains effective and responsive to changing circumstances.

Overall, the answer provides a comprehensive and ethical framework for addressing the Ebola crisis, balancing immediate action with respect for local needs and humanitarian principles.
