The answer provided is specific and actionable, recommending the implementation of a clear opt-in system for students regarding the collection and use of their data for student retention efforts. This approach emphasizes transparency, respect for individual autonomy, and informed decision-making by students. By suggesting a mechanism for students to actively consent to participate in data collection initiatives, the answer addresses the ethical concerns raised by the scenario.

However, the answer could be further improved by acknowledging the complexities of implementing an opt-in system in practice. It would be beneficial to provide additional guidance on how universities can effectively communicate with students about data collection, ensure that consent is truly informed, and establish mechanisms for ongoing oversight and review of data usage. Additionally, considering the evolving nature of data analytics and privacy regulations, it would be prudent to recommend regular updates and revisions to the opt-in system to align with changing ethical standards and student expectations.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical implications of student data usage in higher education, but could benefit from more detailed guidance on practical implementation and long-term sustainability of the proposed opt-in system.
