The answer provided is specific and actionable by suggesting engaging with legal aid organizations to support Michigan residents impacted by the faulty MiDAS system. This approach demonstrates a practical step towards understanding the legal challenges faced by affected individuals and providing additional support. By collaborating with existing organizations, it leverages resources and expertise already in place to address the issue more effectively.

However, the response could be further enhanced by considering additional actions such as advocating for systemic changes to prevent similar incidents in the future, raising awareness about the issue to garner public support, or working towards policy reforms to increase accountability for the implementation of automated systems. These complementary actions could help address the root causes of the problem and prevent similar situations from occurring in the future.

Overall, the answer provides a specific and practical step towards addressing the issue at hand, but could benefit from a more comprehensive approach that tackles both the immediate impact on affected individuals and the systemic issues contributing to such failures in automated systems.
