The answer provided is ethical as it encourages open communication and attempts to address the issue in a constructive manner. By suggesting a private meeting with John to express concerns and offer support, it shows a willingness to handle the situation directly and professionally. The recommendation to seek guidance from a mentor or supervisor also demonstrates a proactive approach to resolving the issue.

However, the answer could be improved by including a more concrete plan of action in case John is uncooperative or dismissive during the meeting. It would be beneficial to outline potential steps to escalate the situation if necessary, such as involving other members of the student government or seeking advice from higher authorities within the organization.

Overall, the answer provides a good starting point for addressing the issue, but could benefit from additional details on how to handle different outcomes of the meeting with John.
