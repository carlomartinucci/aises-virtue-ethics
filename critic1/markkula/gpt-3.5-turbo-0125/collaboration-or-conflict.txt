The answer provided is practical and actionable, offering specific steps for Josh to take in addressing the situation with Alanna and the collaboration with RHA. Scheduling a face-to-face meeting, expressing urgency, listening to concerns, proposing a compromise, involving advisors, and preparing a contingency plan are all concrete actions that Josh can take to try and salvage the collaboration. These steps show a proactive approach to problem-solving and demonstrate a willingness to find a solution that benefits both organizations and the student body.

However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the importance of communication and relationship-building throughout the process. It would be beneficial for Josh to focus on building trust and understanding with Alanna, rather than solely focusing on the logistics of event planning. Additionally, the answer could have included a suggestion for Josh to reflect on his own leadership style and communication approach to ensure he is fostering a positive and collaborative environment.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for Josh to address the situation effectively, but could benefit from a stronger emphasis on communication, relationship-building, and self-reflection.
