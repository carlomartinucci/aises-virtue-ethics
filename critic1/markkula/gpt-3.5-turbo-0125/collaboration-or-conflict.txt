The answer provided is specific and actionable, offering a practical solution to the scenario presented. Scheduling a face-to-face meeting with Alanna to address the issues directly is a proactive step towards resolving the conflict. The emphasis on expressing the importance of the event, listening to Alanna's perspective, and proposing a clear plan of action demonstrates a thoughtful approach to problem-solving. Involving advisors to mediate the discussion is a strategic move to facilitate a productive resolution and salvage the partnership.

However, the answer could be improved by considering the potential reasons behind Alanna's behavior more deeply. Understanding her perspective and concerns on a deeper level could help Josh tailor his approach during the meeting and address the root cause of the issue more effectively. Additionally, the answer could benefit from including a contingency plan in case the meeting with Alanna does not yield the desired outcome, such as exploring alternative collaboration options or adjusting the event planning strategy.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the situation, but could be enhanced by delving deeper into Alanna's perspective and considering backup plans for different outcomes.
