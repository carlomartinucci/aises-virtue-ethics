The answer provided is practical and actionable in addressing the complex situation faced by Mary as the CFO of a family business. It suggests concrete steps for Mary to take, such as scheduling a meeting with all shareholders, proposing a detailed plan for professional management, exploring compromises with Donald, and seeking the advice of a neutral third party. These actions demonstrate a proactive approach to finding a resolution that considers the interests of all stakeholders and preserves the family business's legacy.

However, the answer could benefit from further emphasis on the importance of communication and conflict resolution skills in navigating the differing viewpoints among family members. Encouraging open dialogue, transparency, and active listening can help build consensus and prevent personal animosities from harming relationships within the family. Additionally, addressing the ethical considerations of fairness, transparency, and accountability in decision-making would further enhance the evaluation.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for Mary to approach the situation ethically and practically, but could be strengthened by highlighting the significance of effective communication and ethical principles in guiding her decision-making process.
