The suggested course of action for Drake to schedule a general workshop or information session for all student organizations is a practical and fair solution to the ethical dilemma presented. By providing guidance to all student groups in a group setting, Drake ensures equal access to support and advice, promoting transparency and fairness in the funding process. This approach allows Drake to assist his friend Alex and other student organizations without showing favoritism or compromising the integrity of the process.

However, it would be beneficial for Drake to also consider offering additional resources or follow-up opportunities for individual organizations that may require further assistance or have specific questions. This would demonstrate a commitment to supporting all student groups while still maintaining a level playing field.

Overall, the proposed solution addresses the ethical concerns raised in the scenario by promoting fairness, transparency, and equal access to support for all student organizations. It provides a practical and actionable way for Drake to navigate the situation without compromising his professional ethics.
