The answer provided is specific and actionable, which is good. Scheduling a private meeting with Julia to address the issue directly shows a proactive approach to resolving the situation. Expressing concerns about the misuse of office resources and suggesting alternative solutions demonstrates a willingness to find a compromise. Emphasizing the importance of setting a good example and maintaining the integrity of the organization is a positive way to frame the conversation.

However, the answer could be improved by including a more detailed plan on how to escalate the situation if Julia is resistant to change. It would be beneficial to outline specific steps to take if the issue persists despite the initial discussion. Additionally, considering the potential impact on the organization's budget and student programs, it would be helpful to propose concrete strategies for reducing printing costs or finding alternative resources for Julia's homework.

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma, but could benefit from further elaboration on escalation steps and practical solutions to mitigate the misuse of resources.
