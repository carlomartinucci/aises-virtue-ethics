The proposed solution is practical and actionable, addressing the issue of potential conflicts of interest within the funding committee. By requiring disclosure of conflicts of interest and establishing clear guidelines for recusal, transparency and fairness can be promoted in the decision-making process. Additionally, the suggestion to rotate the leadership of the funding committee is a proactive measure to prevent any individual from exerting undue influence and ensure a more equitable distribution of resources.

However, the response could benefit from further consideration of the potential impact on Garret and the club he leads. While the proposed measures aim to address the issue of bias, there is a risk of causing personal offense to Garret and potentially disrupting the positive contributions he has made to the student government. It would be important to communicate the reasons behind these changes clearly and sensitively to all involved parties to maintain trust and collaboration within the committee.

Overall, the proposed solution is a good starting point for addressing the ethical concerns in this scenario, but it would be beneficial to carefully navigate the potential implications on relationships and team dynamics within the student government.
