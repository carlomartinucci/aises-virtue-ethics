The answer provided is specific and actionable, offering practical steps for Claire to address the conflict of interest within the student government funding committee. By implementing a clear policy for recusal and establishing a rotation schedule for committee leadership, Claire can mitigate the potential bias and promote fairness in the allocation process. The suggestion to communicate the policies transparently and hold a meeting to address concerns demonstrates a proactive approach to managing the situation.

However, one potential drawback is the assumption that Garret and other committee members will readily accept the new policies without resistance. It would be beneficial for Claire to anticipate potential challenges and develop strategies to address them effectively. Additionally, the answer could have emphasized the importance of monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the new policies over time to ensure they are achieving the desired outcomes.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for Claire to address the conflict of interest ethically and effectively, but could benefit from further consideration of potential challenges and the need for ongoing evaluation.
