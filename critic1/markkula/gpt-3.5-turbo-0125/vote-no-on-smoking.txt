The answer provided is a practical and actionable approach to addressing the ethical dilemma faced by Talia. By scheduling a meeting with the university administration and seeking legal advice, she demonstrates a proactive effort to understand the concerns raised. Organizing a town hall meeting with the student body to openly discuss the issue and present both perspectives shows a commitment to transparency and inclusivity in decision-making. Additionally, conducting a follow-up survey to gauge student response and willingness to reconsider their stance reflects a thoughtful approach to gathering feedback and making an informed decision.

However, one potential drawback is the lack of emphasis on Talia's role as a representative of her constituency. While it is important to consider all perspectives and engage in dialogue with stakeholders, Talia must also prioritize representing the interests and wishes of the students who elected her. It would be beneficial for her to find a way to balance the administration's concerns with the desires of her constituency in a more explicit manner.

Overall, the answer provides a solid framework for navigating the ethical dilemma, but could benefit from a more explicit acknowledgment of the importance of representing the student body's interests while considering the administration's concerns.
