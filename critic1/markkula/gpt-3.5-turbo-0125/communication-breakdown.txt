The answer provided is a practical and actionable solution to Derek's dilemma. By organizing a town hall meeting or open forum, Derek can create a platform for students to express their concerns authentically and without filtering. This approach allows for direct student input, ensuring their voices are heard and addressing the issue of inauthenticity that Derek has been struggling with. Additionally, compiling the feedback and presenting it to the Vice Provost demonstrates transparency and accountability in his role as a student leader.

However, one potential downside of this approach is that it may not directly address the issue of the Vice Provost's refusal to discuss Greek life-related issues. While the town hall meeting can provide a platform for student voices to be heard, it may not guarantee a change in the administration's stance on the matter. Derek should be prepared for this possibility and consider additional strategies to address the specific issue of the Vice Provost's reluctance to engage with Greek life-related issues.

Overall, the recommended solution is a positive step towards balancing the needs of the students with the demands of the administration. Derek should continue to seek ways to advocate for student concerns while maintaining a constructive relationship with the Vice Provost.
