Your answer provides a practical and actionable solution to Miguel's dilemma. Delegating responsibilities within the outdoor club while stepping back from decision-making during the petitioning process demonstrates a proactive approach to managing the conflict of interest. Communicating openly with club members about the decision shows transparency and fosters understanding. By prioritizing ethical standards and maintaining neutrality, Miguel can navigate the situation effectively.

However, one area for improvement could be to suggest that Miguel also recuse himself from any discussions or votes related to the outdoor club's petitioning process within the Associated Students to further avoid any perception of bias. This additional step would provide an extra layer of assurance regarding ethical conduct and neutrality. Overall, your response offers a solid plan of action with room for a slight enhancement to strengthen Miguel's ethical stance in this situation.
