The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of ceasing the illegal arrangement with Alex, informing the organization's leadership about the illegal activities, gathering evidence, and working towards establishing a transparent and legal method for exchanging funds. It also highlights the need to support those affected by the illegal activities and ensure they are not negatively impacted. These actions demonstrate a commitment to integrity and accountability.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting that Dave should also seek legal advice to understand the potential consequences of his actions and how to protect himself and others involved. Additionally, it would be beneficial for Dave to undergo training on ethical practices in international development to prevent similar situations in the future. Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma but could benefit from further practical steps to ensure a comprehensive resolution.
