The proposed solution of creating a separate email list for faculty members to share essential information with students is a practical and actionable approach to addressing the issue at hand. By establishing a dedicated channel for faculty communication, it allows for the dissemination of important updates without overwhelming the existing student events email list. This solution demonstrates a proactive effort to balance the needs of both student organizations and faculty members while maintaining the integrity of the current communication system.

Furthermore, the plan to work closely with faculty members to ensure a smooth transition and provide guidance on effective communication practices shows a commitment to collaboration and effective implementation of the new email list.

However, one potential drawback of this solution could be the additional workload it may create for the student government in managing and monitoring the new email list for faculty members. It would be important to establish clear guidelines and protocols for the use of this list to prevent it from becoming cluttered or misused.

Overall, the proposed solution is a positive step towards addressing the concerns raised by faculty members while also considering the impact on student recipients. It is a practical and actionable approach that seeks to find a balance between the needs of different stakeholders in the email communication process.
