It would be beneficial to communicate openly with the donor about the university's ethical standards and the criteria for accepting donations, fostering a sense of mutual understanding and accountability.

By conducting thorough research, seeking input from relevant stakeholders, and making a well-informed decision based on alignment with the university's values, the responder demonstrates a thoughtful and responsible approach to ethical decision-making in fundraising.
