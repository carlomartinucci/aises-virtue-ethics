The proposed solution of implementing a proxy selection process to address the conflict of the two senators missing Senate meetings due to class schedules is a practical and actionable approach. By working closely with the junior senator to identify a suitable proxy and setting clear criteria for selection, the plan aims to ensure that the concerns of constituents are still represented in Senate meetings.

The good aspects of this solution include its proactive approach in finding a solution to the problem, the focus on maintaining representation for constituents, and the structured process outlined for selecting and briefing the proxy. By involving the junior senator in the process and providing support to the selected proxy, it shows consideration for the individuals involved and the importance of their roles within the organization.

However, a potential downside of this solution could be the risk of the proxy not fully capturing the perspectives and priorities of the absent senator, leading to potential misrepresentation of constituents' concerns. Additionally, there may be challenges in ensuring the proxy's availability and commitment to fulfilling the responsibilities effectively.

To improve this solution, it would be beneficial to also explore alternative options such as recording meetings for the absent senators to review, facilitating communication channels for them to contribute outside of meetings, or adjusting the attendance policy to accommodate exceptional circumstances like class conflicts. Overall, while the proposed proxy selection process is a practical step towards addressing the issue, it could be strengthened by considering additional measures to enhance representation and engagement of the absent senators.
