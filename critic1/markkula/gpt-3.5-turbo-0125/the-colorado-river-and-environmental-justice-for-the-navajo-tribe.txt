The proposed action to facilitate direct engagement between the Navajo Nation representatives and key stakeholders involved in the water allocation discussions is a specific and actionable step towards addressing the exclusion of the Navajo tribe from the decision-making processes. By establishing a formal platform for dialogue and collaboration, the concerns and perspectives of the Navajo tribe can be integrated into the negotiations, leading to more equitable outcomes for all parties involved.

This action is practical as it provides a structured mechanism for ensuring the participation of the Navajo tribe in shaping water allocation decisions related to the Colorado River. By actively including Navajo voices in the decision-making process, the action aims to address historical injustices and promote a more inclusive and fair approach to water allocation.

Overall, the proposed action is a positive step towards promoting environmental justice and ensuring that all stakeholders, including marginalized communities like the Navajo tribe, have a voice in critical discussions that impact their access to water resources.
