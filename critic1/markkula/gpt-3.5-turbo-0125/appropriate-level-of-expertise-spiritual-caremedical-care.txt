The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being of John and acknowledges the limitations of the pastor's expertise. It offers practical steps to address the situation, such as scheduling a private meeting with John to express concern, emphasizing the importance of seeking professional help, and reaching out to other church members for support.

The answer also suggests offering assistance in finding a mental health professional or substance abuse counselor, encouraging John to attend a support group meeting, and providing ongoing spiritual guidance and support. These actions demonstrate a proactive approach to addressing John's needs while respecting professional boundaries.

However, the answer could be improved by including specific details on how to handle the situation if John continues to refuse professional help or support group meetings. Providing alternative options or strategies for engaging John in seeking help would enhance the practicality of the response.

Overall, the answer effectively addresses the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario by focusing on John's well-being and offering tangible steps to support him.
