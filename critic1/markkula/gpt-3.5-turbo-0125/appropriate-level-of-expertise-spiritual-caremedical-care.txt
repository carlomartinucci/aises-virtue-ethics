The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being of John and acknowledges the limitations of the pastor's expertise in addressing clinical depression and substance abuse. The action steps suggested are specific and practical, focusing on scheduling a meeting with John to discuss his struggles, expressing concern, and offering assistance in finding professional help. The recommendation to involve other church members with relevant expertise is a good way to provide additional support for John.

However, the answer could be improved by including a more proactive approach in ensuring John's safety, such as contacting a mental health hotline or emergency services if there are immediate concerns about his well-being. Additionally, the pastor could consider exploring alternative options for support if John continues to refuse professional help, such as connecting him with community resources or support groups outside the church.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a good balance of empathy and practicality in addressing John's complex situation, but could benefit from a more assertive approach in ensuring his immediate safety and exploring alternative avenues for support.
