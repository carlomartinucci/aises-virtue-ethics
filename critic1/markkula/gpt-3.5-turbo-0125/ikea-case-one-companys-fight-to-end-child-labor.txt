The suggested action for IKEA to establish a comprehensive supplier monitoring program to address the issue of child labor in its supply chain is a practical and specific solution. By conducting regular on-site visits, training auditors to identify signs of child labor, and collaborating with local organizations, IKEA can effectively monitor and enforce ethical standards within its supply chain.

The good aspects of this solution include its proactive approach to addressing the issue, demonstrating a commitment to ethical practices, and potentially improving working conditions for vulnerable populations like children. By taking concrete steps to monitor suppliers and enforce compliance, IKEA can work towards eliminating child labor from its supply chain and upholding its corporate social responsibility.

However, a potential drawback of this solution is the resource-intensive nature of implementing and maintaining a comprehensive monitoring program. It may require significant investments in terms of time, manpower, and financial resources. Additionally, there could be challenges in ensuring the effectiveness and transparency of the monitoring process, especially in high-risk countries where child labor practices are prevalent.

Overall, the suggested action is a practical and actionable step for IKEA to address the issue of child labor in its supply chain. To enhance the evaluation, it would be beneficial to provide specific strategies for overcoming potential challenges and ensuring the sustainability of the monitoring program in the long term.
