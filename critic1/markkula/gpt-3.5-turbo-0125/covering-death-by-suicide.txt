The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of consulting mental health professionals and campus counselors for guidance on how to approach the sensitive topic of covering a student's death by suicide. It also suggests gathering insights from friends, faculty, and staff to create a more nuanced and respectful tribute to the student's memory. These actions demonstrate a thoughtful and responsible approach to journalism in the context of mental health awareness.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific suggestions on how to incorporate mental health resources and helpline information in the article. It would also be beneficial to recommend ways to address the potential risks associated with the contagion theory, such as framing the story in a way that emphasizes hope, resilience, and the importance of seeking help.

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for ethical decision-making in this scenario but could benefit from more actionable steps to ensure that the coverage is both sensitive and impactful in promoting mental health awareness on campus.
