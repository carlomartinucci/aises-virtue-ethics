The recommendation to establish a post-trial support program for the participants in Russia is a practical and actionable solution to address the ethical concerns raised in the scenario. By providing continued access to the drug at an affordable cost or for free, the company can ensure that the participants do not suffer negative consequences from discontinuing treatment after the trial ends. Collaborating with local healthcare providers to offer ongoing medical care and support is also a positive step towards maintaining the well-being of the participants.

However, the recommendation could be further improved by emphasizing the importance of informed consent and ensuring that the participants fully understand the implications of their involvement in the trial. The company should have taken additional steps to ensure that the participants had the necessary knowledge and understanding to make an informed decision about participating in the trial, especially considering their lack of relevant educational background.

Overall, the recommendation to establish a post-trial support program is a good starting point, but the company should also reflect on the informed consent process and take responsibility for any shortcomings in ensuring that the participants were fully informed and protected throughout the trial.
