The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes the patient's autonomy and well-being while also considering the legal implications of her situation. The approach of having a detailed discussion with the patient about the legal requirements and potential consequences of reporting, as well as exploring alternative options for treatment, shows a balanced consideration of the complex ethical and legal issues at play.

The emphasis on providing support, resources, and information to help the patient make an informed decision aligns with ethical principles of beneficence and respect for autonomy. By discussing the importance of prenatal care and monitoring, the answer also addresses the immediate health needs of both the patient and the fetus.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific details on the alternative treatment options available, such as specific programs or facilities that cater to pregnant women with substance use disorders. Additionally, a more concrete plan for ongoing support and monitoring throughout the pregnancy would enhance the practicality of the response.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a good balance of ethical considerations and practical guidance, but could benefit from more specificity in outlining alternative treatment options and ongoing support for the patient.
