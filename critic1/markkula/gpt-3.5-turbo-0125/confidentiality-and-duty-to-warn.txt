The answer provided is specific, practical, and actionable. It addresses the immediate concern of the client's expressed desire to stalk Susan and her new boyfriend by clearly stating that such behavior is unacceptable and illegal. The response also includes educating the client on the potential consequences of stalking, developing a safety plan, exploring underlying reasons for the client's feelings, and involving other mental health professionals or support systems as needed.

The good aspects of this response include the clear communication of boundaries and consequences, the focus on education and prevention, and the emphasis on therapy techniques to address the client's underlying issues. The plan to involve other professionals or support systems shows a comprehensive approach to ensuring the client's safety and well-being.

However, a potential improvement could be to also address the client's feelings of rejection and inadequacy more directly and explore them in greater depth. Additionally, the response could benefit from a more detailed safety plan that includes specific strategies and steps to prevent the client from acting on his impulses.

Overall, the response is ethical, practical, and provides a solid framework for addressing the client's concerning behavior while prioritizing his well-being and safety.
