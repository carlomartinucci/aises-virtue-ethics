The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing Saumya's situation. It suggests a thorough review of the remaining candidates' qualifications, offering mentorship or training if needed, and reaching out to friends as potential candidates while ensuring they go through the same selection process. Additionally, organizing a meeting with committee chairs to understand their needs is a proactive step towards making informed decisions.

One positive aspect is the emphasis on fairness and transparency by treating all candidates equally in the selection process. The suggestion to provide support and guidance to all candidates shows a commitment to helping them succeed in their roles.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of consideration for the feelings of the candidates who actively applied but may not be selected in favor of Saumya's friends. It would be beneficial to address this aspect by communicating openly with all candidates about the selection process and the criteria being considered.

Overall, the answer provides actionable steps to navigate the situation effectively, but it could benefit from further emphasis on communication and transparency with all candidates involved.
