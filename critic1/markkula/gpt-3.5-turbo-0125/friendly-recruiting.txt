The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing Saumya's situation. It suggests a step-by-step approach starting with reviewing the remaining candidates' applications for transferable skills, offering guidance to enhance their qualifications, and only considering reaching out to friends as a last resort. This approach demonstrates a fair attempt to give all candidates a chance while also considering the best fit for the committees.

One positive aspect of the answer is the emphasis on providing support and guidance to all candidates, showing a commitment to helping them develop the necessary skills for the roles. Additionally, the suggestion to maintain fairness and transparency in the selection process by requiring friends to go through the formal application process is commendable.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of consideration for potential biases that may arise from Saumya's personal relationships with her friends. While the answer mentions fairness and transparency, it could be strengthened by including specific strategies to mitigate any favoritism towards friends in the selection process.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable approach to handling the situation, with a focus on fairness and support for all candidates. To improve, it could address potential biases more explicitly and offer specific strategies to ensure an unbiased selection process.
