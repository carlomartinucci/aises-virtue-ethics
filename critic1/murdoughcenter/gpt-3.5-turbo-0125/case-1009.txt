The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on open communication, understanding the client's perspective, and offering potential solutions to address the situation. By scheduling a meeting with Mr. Young, the individual is taking proactive steps to address the issue and potentially salvage the relationship. Additionally, proposing revised cost estimates, additional services, or adjusted payment terms shows a willingness to accommodate the client's needs and potentially win back the project.

However, the answer could be improved by being more assertive in protecting the firm's interests. While it is important to understand the client's concerns and offer solutions, it is also crucial to assert the value of the firm's work and expertise. The individual could have emphasized the unique qualifications and experience of their firm, highlighting why they are the best choice for the project. Additionally, setting clear boundaries and expectations regarding the handling of proposals and communication could help prevent similar situations in the future.

Overall, the answer provides a good foundation for addressing the issue ethically by focusing on communication and problem-solving. To enhance the response, the individual should assert the firm's value more strongly and establish clear boundaries to prevent similar occurrences.
