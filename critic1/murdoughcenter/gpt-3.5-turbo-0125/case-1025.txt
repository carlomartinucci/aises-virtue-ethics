The response provided is practical and actionable in addressing the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. Consulting with a lawyer to explore legal action against the parties responsible for the failure to obtain permission for the tiebacks demonstrates a proactive approach to holding them accountable. Reviewing and revising internal protocols to prevent similar oversights in the future is a positive step towards improving processes within the firm. Engaging in mediation or negotiation with the adjacent property owner to reach a fair resolution also shows a willingness to address the situation constructively.

However, the response could be further improved by emphasizing the importance of transparency and communication throughout the process. It would be beneficial to actively communicate with all parties involved, including the bank, contractor, and adjacent property owner, to ensure clarity and understanding of the situation. Additionally, highlighting the need for clear documentation and record-keeping to support the firm's position in any legal proceedings would strengthen the response.

Overall, the response provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical issues at hand, but could benefit from a stronger emphasis on communication, transparency, and documentation to effectively navigate the situation and protect the firm's interests.
