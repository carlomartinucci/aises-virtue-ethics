The answer provided is practical and specific in addressing the discovery of Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert's personal relationship. By advising to discuss this information with the legal team representing Wastewater Treatment Systems, the answer suggests a strategic approach to potentially challenge Cleghorn's credibility during the trial. Bringing up this information during cross-examination to question Cleghorn's objectivity is a valid tactic to cast doubt on his expert opinions. Furthermore, recommending seeking legal counsel on how to leverage this information within legal boundaries shows a cautious and responsible approach to handling the situation.

However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the importance of maintaining professionalism and ethical standards throughout the process. It would be beneficial to highlight the need to focus on the facts and evidence rather than personal relationships, ensuring that any actions taken are in the best interest of the case and do not veer into unethical territory. Additionally, addressing the potential implications of using personal information in a legal setting, such as privacy concerns or ethical boundaries, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the situation.
