The answer provided is ethical as it addresses the conflict of interest and emphasizes transparency and proper business conduct. It outlines specific steps for Daulton to take, such as scheduling a meeting with Elias and Shellie, expressing concerns, requesting divestment of the property, informing Conner, seeking legal advice, and documenting decisions. These actions demonstrate a commitment to ethical behavior and mitigating potential risks for ClearWater Developers.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more detailed guidance on how to handle the situation if Elias and Shellie refuse to divest themselves of the property or if they react negatively to Daulton's concerns. It would also be beneficial to include advice on how to communicate with stakeholders, such as the local community or regulatory authorities, to maintain transparency and trust in the project.

Overall, the answer is practical and actionable, offering a clear roadmap for Daulton to navigate the ethical dilemma effectively.
