The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes open dialogue, brainstorming for solutions, and involving key employees in decision-making. The suggestion to conduct a financial review with the help of a financial advisor is practical and actionable, as it can help identify areas for improvement and strategic planning. Seeking external financing or partnerships is a proactive approach to stabilize operations without resorting to unethical practices.

However, the evaluation could be improved by providing more specific steps for Sam to take during the meeting with key employees. For example, outlining a timeline for the financial review process, setting clear goals for cost-cutting measures, and assigning responsibilities to team members for implementing the strategic plan would enhance the practicality of the response. Additionally, addressing potential concerns or objections from employees, such as Cal's adherence to ethical standards, would further strengthen the evaluation.
