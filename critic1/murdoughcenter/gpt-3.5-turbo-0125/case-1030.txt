The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes safety and compliance with regulations. It offers a practical and actionable solution to the problem at hand. By suggesting that Reilly should contact a certified fire safety expert to conduct an inspection and present the findings to the project team, it ensures that the issue is addressed in a thorough and professional manner.

One positive aspect of this answer is that it emphasizes the importance of safety and compliance, which should always be a top priority in engineering projects. By involving an expert to assess the situation, Reilly can make an informed decision based on objective findings rather than speculation.

However, one potential drawback is that the answer does not address the potential consequences of further delays or cost increases that may result from rectifying any non-compliance issues. It would be beneficial to include a suggestion on how to mitigate these risks while still ensuring the safety of the wastewater treatment plant.

Overall, the answer provides a clear and practical course of action for Reilly to follow, which aligns with ethical principles of ensuring safety and compliance in engineering projects.
