The recommendation to consult with the hospital's ethics committee and seek guidance on the best course of action is a practical and actionable step in addressing the complex ethical dilemma presented in the scenario. Involving experts in bioethics can provide valuable insights and ensure that decisions are made with the patient's rights and well-being at the forefront. Seeking input from a mental health advocate or legal expert also demonstrates a commitment to making decisions in the patient's best interest and in compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific details on how to engage with the ethics committee and what steps should be taken to involve a mental health advocate or legal expert. Offering concrete suggestions on how to navigate the process of decision-making in such a challenging situation would enhance the practicality of the advice given. Additionally, addressing the discomfort of the hospital staff and how to manage their concerns effectively would further strengthen the evaluation.
