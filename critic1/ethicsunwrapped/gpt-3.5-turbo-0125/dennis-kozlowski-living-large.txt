The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on conducting a thorough review of Tyco International's corporate governance policies and procedures to identify any weaknesses or deficiencies that may have contributed to the ethical lapses observed during Dennis Kozlowski's leadership. This approach is fair and objective, aiming to understand the root causes of the unauthorized bonuses and financial misconduct rather than making assumptions or passing judgment.

The good in this response is the emphasis on conducting a detailed review of governance mechanisms, board meeting minutes, internal audit reports, and financial disclosures. This methodical approach can provide valuable insights into the oversight mechanisms in place during Kozlowski's tenure and help pinpoint any specific areas that need improvement to prevent similar ethical lapses in the future.

However, a potential drawback is the lack of immediate action or accountability. While reviewing governance policies is crucial for long-term prevention, there may be a need for more immediate steps to address any ongoing issues or potential risks within the organization. It would be beneficial to also consider implementing interim measures to strengthen oversight and transparency while the review is being conducted.

To enhance the response, it would be advisable to include recommendations for implementing short-term corrective actions alongside the governance review. This could involve enhancing internal controls, increasing transparency in financial reporting, or establishing an independent oversight committee to monitor executive compensation and bonuses. By combining a comprehensive review with actionable recommendations, the organization can demonstrate a commitment to ethical governance and rebuild trust with stakeholders.
