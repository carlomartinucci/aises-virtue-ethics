The answer provided is specific, practical, and actionable in addressing the ethical implications of Dennis Kozlowski's actions at Tyco International. By conducting a comprehensive review of the company's corporate governance policies and practices, engaging with key stakeholders, and recommending ethics training programs, the response aims to identify lapses in oversight, understand the corporate culture, and prevent future ethical breaches.

The strengths of this approach lie in its systematic and thorough examination of the factors that may have contributed to Kozlowski's misconduct. By analyzing board meeting minutes, compensation agreements, and internal audit reports, the review can pinpoint weaknesses in oversight mechanisms. Engaging with stakeholders allows for a holistic understanding of the organizational culture and potential red flags that were overlooked. The recommendation of ethics training programs demonstrates a proactive effort to instill a culture of transparency, integrity, and accountability within the company.

However, a potential limitation of this response is the lack of emphasis on holding individuals, including Kozlowski, accountable for their actions. While improving corporate governance and ethics training is crucial for preventing future misconduct, addressing past wrongdoing and ensuring consequences for those responsible is also essential for upholding ethical standards and restoring trust in the organization.

Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation for addressing the ethical implications of Kozlowski's actions at Tyco International, but it could be strengthened by incorporating measures for accountability and consequences for those involved in the misconduct.
