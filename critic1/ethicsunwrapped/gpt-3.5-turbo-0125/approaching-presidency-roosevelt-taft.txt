The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of consulting legal experts and constitutional scholars before taking actions that may push the boundaries of executive power. By seeking legal opinions and proactively engaging with legal counsel, President Roosevelt can ensure that his decisions are legally sound and uphold the rule of law.

The good in this answer is that it promotes a proactive approach to decision-making, ensuring that the president's actions are in line with legal boundaries and minimizing the risk of conflicts with Congress or legal challenges. By seeking expert advice, President Roosevelt can make more informed and ethical decisions that respect the rule of law.

However, a potential drawback is that the answer does not address the broader ethical implications of Roosevelt's expansionist view of the presidency. While seeking legal advice is important, it may not fully address the ethical concerns raised by his actions, such as potentially overriding states' jurisdiction or fostering revolt in other countries. A more comprehensive evaluation could have delved deeper into the ethical considerations of Roosevelt's approach and provided suggestions for balancing ethical concerns with legal boundaries.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable recommendation for President Roosevelt to navigate the complexities of executive power, but it could benefit from a more thorough examination of the ethical dimensions of his actions.
