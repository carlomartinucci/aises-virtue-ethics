The answer provided is ethical as it promotes academic integrity and prioritizes the well-being of the students. By refusing to change the students' answers on the standardized tests and instead focusing on providing additional support through after-school tutoring, study groups, and involving parents, the approach aligns with ethical principles of honesty and fairness in education.

The proactive steps suggested, such as organizing tutoring sessions and collaborating with other teachers, demonstrate a genuine effort to help students improve their performance in a legitimate way. Involving parents and seeking their support also shows a commitment to transparency and accountability in the educational process.

However, a potential drawback of this approach is that it may not address the immediate pressure and consequences faced by the school and its students if they fail to meet the standardized test goals. While the long-term benefits of genuine academic improvement are emphasized, the short-term challenges and risks associated with potential school closure are not directly addressed in the response.

To enhance the evaluation, it would be beneficial to acknowledge the complex circumstances faced by Lewis and other teachers at Parks Middle School, such as the high-stakes testing environment and the fear of school closure. Providing additional strategies to navigate these challenges while upholding ethical standards would further strengthen the response.
