The answer provided is ethical as it involves reporting Enron's fraudulent activities to the appropriate authorities, which is crucial in holding the company accountable for its actions and seeking justice for those impacted. By providing detailed information about the schemes used by Enron to manipulate electricity markets in California and encouraging other employees to come forward, the answer demonstrates a commitment to transparency and integrity.

However, one potential improvement could be to also suggest reaching out to internal compliance or ethics departments within Enron, if they exist, before reporting to external authorities. This could help address the issue internally first and potentially prevent further harm. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of cooperating fully with investigations and being prepared to testify if needed would further strengthen the ethical response.

Overall, the answer is specific, practical, and actionable in addressing the unethical behavior at Enron and seeking justice for those affected.
