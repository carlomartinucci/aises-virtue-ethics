The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it suggests a concrete and actionable step to address the public's concerns and restore trust in the executive branch. By proposing the appointment of an independent commission to investigate the Watergate scandal and the circumstances surrounding the pardon, it aims to bring transparency and accountability to the situation.

One positive aspect of this answer is the emphasis on transparency and accountability through an independent investigation. This would help shed light on the events in question and provide the public with a clearer understanding of the decision-making process. It also shows a commitment to upholding ethical standards in government by allowing for a thorough examination of the pardon decision.

However, a potential downside of this approach is that it may not fully address the anger and suspicions of the public regarding the pardon. While an investigation can provide information and recommendations, it may not necessarily lead to concrete consequences for those involved. Additionally, the effectiveness of such a commission in rebuilding trust in the executive branch is uncertain, as public perception may remain skeptical even after the investigation.

In conclusion, while the proposed action is a step in the right direction towards addressing the ethical concerns raised by the pardon of Richard Nixon, it may not fully satisfy the public's demands for accountability and justice. Further steps may be needed to truly restore trust in the executive branch and address the lingering suspicions surrounding the pardon.
