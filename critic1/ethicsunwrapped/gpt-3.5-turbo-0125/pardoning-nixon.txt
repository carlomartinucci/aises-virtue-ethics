The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it suggests a concrete action to address the public's concerns and restore trust in the executive branch. By proposing the formation of a bipartisan commission to thoroughly review the Watergate scandal and the pardon of Nixon, it aims to promote transparency and accountability.

On the positive side, convening such a commission would demonstrate a commitment to addressing the public's concerns and upholding ethical standards. It would provide an opportunity for a comprehensive examination of the events surrounding the pardon, potentially shedding light on any questionable dealings and ensuring that accountability is upheld.

However, on the negative side, there are potential drawbacks to consider. The formation of a commission may be seen as a political move to deflect criticism rather than a genuine effort to address the underlying issues. Additionally, the effectiveness of such a commission in restoring public trust may be limited, as the public's perception of the pardon may already be deeply entrenched.

In conclusion, while the proposed action is a step in the right direction towards rebuilding trust in the executive branch, it is important for President Ford to ensure that the commission operates with integrity, independence, and transparency to truly address the concerns of the public and uphold ethical standards.
