The suggested action of establishing a support network within the group to resist peer pressure and make ethical choices is a practical and actionable step that can help individuals navigate challenging situations. By forming alliances with like-minded colleagues, individuals can find strength in numbers and create a safe space for discussing concerns and upholding ethical values. This approach can provide encouragement, validation, and solidarity, making it easier for individuals to resist conformity and make principled decisions.

One positive aspect of this action is that it recognizes the power of peer influence and the importance of having a support system in place to counteract negative pressures. By fostering open communication and mutual accountability within the group, members can hold each other to higher ethical standards and collectively uphold moral integrity in their actions.

However, a potential drawback of this approach is that it may not address the root causes of why individuals succumb to peer pressure in the first place. While a support network can provide emotional support and encouragement, it may not necessarily address deeper issues such as fear of rejection, desire for acceptance, or internalized beliefs about obedience to authority figures.

Overall, the suggested action is a practical and actionable step that can help individuals resist peer pressure and make ethical choices in challenging situations. However, it should be complemented with efforts to address underlying psychological and social factors that contribute to conformity and unethical behavior.
