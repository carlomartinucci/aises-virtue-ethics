The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on supporting the victims of sexual assault within the Baylor community. By setting up dedicated support systems, counseling services, and advocacy groups, the response prioritizes the well-being and empowerment of survivors. This survivor-centered approach is crucial in addressing the trauma and ensuring that survivors have the necessary resources to cope and navigate the reporting process.

However, the answer could be improved by also addressing the accountability of those responsible for enabling the culture of misconduct within the football program. It is important to not only support the victims but also hold individuals like Art Briles, Ian McCaw, and others accountable for their actions or inactions that contributed to the mishandling of sexual assault cases. Implementing measures to prevent such incidents from happening again, such as thorough training on Title IX obligations and reporting protocols, is essential to creating a safer environment for all students at Baylor.

In summary, while the focus on supporting victims is commendable, a more comprehensive approach that includes accountability measures and prevention strategies would further enhance the ethical response to the situation at Baylor University.
