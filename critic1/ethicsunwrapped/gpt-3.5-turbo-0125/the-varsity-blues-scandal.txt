The proposed action of implementing mandatory ethics training is a practical and actionable step towards addressing the aftermath of the "Varsity Blues" scandal. By collaborating with educational institutions to provide specific guidance on ethical decision-making, consequences of fraudulent practices, and the importance of integrity in the admissions process, this training can help prevent future scandals and ensure that individuals involved are equipped to make ethical choices.

The good in this proposal lies in its specificity and direct relevance to the issue at hand. Ethics training can indeed be effective in raising awareness and promoting ethical behavior among college counselors, admissions officers, and staff members. By emphasizing the values of honesty and fairness, this training can potentially deter individuals from engaging in fraudulent practices similar to those orchestrated by Rick Singer.

However, a potential drawback is that while ethics training is valuable, it may not completely eradicate unethical behavior. Some individuals may still choose to act unethically despite being aware of the consequences. Therefore, additional measures such as increased oversight, transparency, and accountability within the admissions process may be necessary to complement the ethics training.

Overall, the proposed action is a positive step towards addressing the ethical lapses exposed by the "Varsity Blues" scandal. It provides a practical solution that can contribute to fostering a culture of integrity within college admissions, but it should be part of a broader strategy that includes multiple layers of prevention and detection mechanisms.
