The answer provided is ethical in the sense that it promotes taking responsibility for unintentional infringement and showing respect for the original artist's work. By recommending a public apology, expressing genuine remorse, and offering to collaborate with the Gaye estate, it acknowledges the influence of Marvin Gaye's music and aims to make amends for any perceived wrongdoing.

However, the answer could be improved by suggesting concrete actions that go beyond mere gestures. For instance, Thicke and Williams could offer a percentage of future royalties from "Blurred Lines" to the Gaye estate as a form of compensation for the similarities in the songs. They could also commit to supporting initiatives that educate artists on copyright issues and promote ethical practices in music creation.

Overall, while the answer is on the right track in terms of acknowledging the influence of Marvin Gaye's work and proposing a collaborative approach, it could be strengthened by including more specific and actionable steps to rectify the situation and prevent similar issues in the future.
