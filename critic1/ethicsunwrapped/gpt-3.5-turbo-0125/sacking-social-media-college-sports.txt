The proposed actions are specific and actionable, addressing the need for updated social media policies, education for athletes, monitoring tools, and a review process. By convening a meeting to collaborate on policy updates, the approach shows inclusivity and a willingness to involve all stakeholders. The interactive workshops are a proactive way to educate athletes and encourage open dialogue, fostering a culture of responsibility. Implementing monitoring software like UDiligence demonstrates a commitment to proactive intervention and guidance.

However, the plan could benefit from more emphasis on the balance between freedom of expression and responsibility. It would be helpful to include discussions on the importance of athletes' voices while highlighting the potential consequences of inappropriate social media use. Additionally, incorporating real-life examples or case studies of both positive and negative social media behavior could enhance the educational workshops.

Overall, the plan is practical and detailed, providing a structured approach to managing social media use among college athletes. By incorporating a more nuanced discussion on freedom of expression and responsibility and integrating real-life examples into educational initiatives, the proposed actions could further enhance their effectiveness in promoting responsible online behavior.
