The response provided is ethical as it prioritizes the well-being of the victim and advocates for accountability for those who were aware of the abuse but failed to take appropriate action. By emphasizing the importance of reporting the information to the authorities and ensuring a proper investigation, it aligns with ethical principles of justice and protection of vulnerable individuals. Additionally, the call to address systemic failures and prevent similar incidents in the future reflects a commitment to learning from past mistakes and promoting a safer environment.

However, the response could be further strengthened by suggesting specific steps to support the victim, such as connecting them with counseling services or support groups. It could also recommend implementing policies and procedures within institutions to encourage reporting of abuse and ensure swift and appropriate responses. By providing actionable recommendations for both immediate and long-term actions, the response could have a more significant impact in addressing the ethical issues highlighted in the scenario.
