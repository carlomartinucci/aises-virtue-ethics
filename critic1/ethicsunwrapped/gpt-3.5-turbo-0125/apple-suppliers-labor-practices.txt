The answer provided is ethical as it involves taking concrete steps to address the unethical sourcing practices in Apple's supply chain. By collaborating with external organizations and conducting independent audits, the answer aims to ensure transparency, accountability, and compliance with ethical standards. The recommendation to implement a monitoring system for sustained improvements is also commendable.

However, the answer could be improved by specifying the criteria and standards that would be used during the audits, as well as outlining a clear plan for holding Apple accountable for any violations found. Additionally, it would be beneficial to suggest ways to involve stakeholders such as workers, local communities, and advocacy groups in the monitoring process to ensure a comprehensive approach to addressing the issue.

Overall, the answer provides a practical and actionable solution to the ethical concerns raised in the scenario, but could benefit from more detailed planning and consideration of stakeholder involvement for a more comprehensive and effective approach.
