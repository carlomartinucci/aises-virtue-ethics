The proposed intervention strategy of incorporating a prompt at the checkout counter for green products to counteract potential moral licensing effects is a specific and actionable solution to address the negative consequences identified in the scenario. By leveraging the moment of purchase to influence subsequent behavior, the intervention targets the situational context where moral licensing effects may occur.

The suggestion to conduct a follow-up study to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention is a proactive approach to refining and optimizing the strategy based on empirical data. This demonstrates a commitment to evidence-based decision-making and continuous improvement.

However, one potential limitation is the assumption that a simple prompt at the checkout counter will be effective in counteracting complex psychological mechanisms like moral licensing. It may be beneficial to consider additional strategies or complementary interventions to reinforce ethical decision-making beyond just a single prompt.

Overall, the proposed intervention is a practical and ethically sound approach to mitigating the negative consequences associated with green consumer behavior. By combining targeted messaging with empirical evaluation, this strategy has the potential to positively impact consumer behavior and promote ethical conduct in the context of green product purchases.
