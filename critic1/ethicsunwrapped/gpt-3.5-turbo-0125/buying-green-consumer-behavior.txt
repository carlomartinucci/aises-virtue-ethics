The proposed action of designing a longitudinal study to track the purchasing behaviors of consumers of green products and implementing an intervention strategy to raise awareness about moral licensing effects is a practical and specific approach to addressing the potential negative consequences associated with green consumer behavior. 

The longitudinal study would provide valuable insights into how purchasing green products may influence subsequent ethical decision-making and altruistic behaviors over time. This data could help identify patterns and trends that indicate moral licensing effects, allowing for a better understanding of the issue.

Furthermore, the intervention strategy aimed at raising awareness among consumers about moral licensing is proactive and could potentially help mitigate the negative consequences of such behavior. By educating consumers about the potential pitfalls of moral licensing and encouraging consistent ethical decision-making, there is a chance to promote more mindful and responsible behavior when purchasing green products.

Overall, the proposed action is actionable, specific, and addresses the issue at hand effectively by combining research with practical intervention efforts. It demonstrates a proactive approach to tackling the potential downsides of green consumer behavior.
