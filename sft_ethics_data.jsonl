Key to Abramoff’s conviction were his lobbying efforts that began in the 1990s on behalf of Native American tribes seeking to establish gambling on reservations.\n\nIn 1996, Abramoff began working for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. With the help of Republican tax reform advocate Grover Norquist, and his political advocacy group Americans for Tax Reform, Abramoff defeated a Congressional bill that would have taxed Native American casinos. Texas Representative and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay also played a major role in the bill’s defeat. DeLay pushed the agenda of Abramoff’s lobbying clients in exchange for favors from Abramoff.\n\nIn 1999, Abramoff similarly lobbied to defeat a bill in the Alabama State Legislature that would have allowed casino-style games on dog racing tracks. This bill would have created competition for his clients’ casino businesses. Republican political activist Ralph Reed, and his political consulting firm Century Strategies, aided the effort by leading a grassroots campaign that rallied Alabama-based Christian organizations to oppose the bill.\n\nAs Abramoff’s successes grew, his clients, political contacts, and influence expanded. He hired aides and former staff of members of Congress. In 2001, Abramoff began working with Congressman DeLay’s former communications director, Michael Scanlon, who had formed his own public affairs consulting firm, Capitol Campaign Strategies. The Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana hired Abramoff and Capitol Campaign Strategies to help them renegotiate their gambling agreement with the State of Louisiana. Abramoff, however, did not disclose to the tribe that, in addition to his own consulting fees, he also received a portion of the fees paid to Scanlon’s firm.\n\nIn an effort to protect his Coushatta clients in Louisiana from competition by a new casino near Houston, Texas, Abramoff successfully lobbied for a state gambling ban in Texas between 2001 and 2002. Incidental to this ban was the closure of a casino in El Paso, Texas, owned by the Tigua Tribal Nation. The Tigua were another one of Abramoff’s casino clients.\n\nLater in 2002, Abramoff made a pitch to the Tigua to work to oppose the ban for which he had previously lobbied successfully. With the Tigua’s money, Abramoff took Ohio Representative Bob Ney and his staff on a golfing trip to Scotland. Abramoff hoped to convince Ney and his colleagues to slip a provision into an election-reform bill that would grant the Tigua gaming rights. Abramoff’s efforts did not pay off, and the deal he sought fell through, but he did not inform the Tigua of this outcome. Rather, Abramoff continued to give the Tigua hope for the provision’s success, while also continuing to charge them for his and Scanlon’s services. And, in their email exchanges, Abramoff and Scanlon often mocked their tribal clients as “morons” and “monkeys.”\n\nThroughout the course of their work with Native American tribes, Abramoff and Scanlon charged upwards of $66 million. The Coushatta paid over $30 million to protect their casino and to stop competing casinos in Texas. The Tigua paid $4.2 million to try to continue operating their casino in Texas. Abramoff has stated that he donated much of the money he made to charities, schools, and causes he believed in. But he also spent millions of dollars on activities or contributions in connection with politicians and campaigns he sought to influence. Furthermore, he evaded taxes by funneling money through nonprofit organizations with which he partnered.\n\nAfter his conviction in 2006, Abramoff cooperated in the investigation of his relationships with Congress members, including aides, business associates, government officials, and lawmakers. Representatives DeLay and Ney both stepped down from their positions in Congress. DeLay, who had risen to the rank of House Majority Leader, was charged with money laundering and conspiracy of funneling corporate contributions to state candidates. Ney plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and making false statements. In exchange for gifts, lavish trips, and political donations from Abramoff, DeLay and Ney had used their positions in Congress to grant favors to Abramoff’s clients and lobbying team. Abramoff served three and a half years of a six-year prison term. He was released on December 3, 2010.\n\nSince his release, Abramoff has spoken out against corruption in politics. He has stated that he believed himself to be a “moral lobbyist” and has apologized for his actions. In a 2011 interview, he said, “What’s legal in this system is the problem,” and in his memoir, he wrote, “Unfortunately, I was a miniature version of that system.” But not everyone perceived his redemption as a genuine effort. Tigua tribal leaders said his apologies were too little, too late. Rick Hill, former chairman of the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, stated, “You look at Jack—though he took money from my elders and our kids, and now he comes here, and he gets to prop himself up, and it’s an acceptable part of [Washington] D.C. culture. He wouldn’t stand a minute on the reservation.”\n\nOthers point to the American political system, and see Abramoff as a symptom of broader corruption. Investigative journalist Susan Schmidt stated, “Abramoff couldn’t have flourished if this system, itself, was not corrupt, where the need for money—the members of Congress and their need for money—is so voracious and so huge that they don’t have their guard up.” California Representative Dana Rohrabacher said, “What Jack had been doing was what had been done before. People should pay more attention to the fact that we have got some enormous special interests in this country who are having incredible influences on policy.”\n\nIn his memoir, Abramoff reflected on personal and professional reform: “Regardless of my rationalizations, I was the one who didn’t disclose to my clients that there was a conflict of interest… I wasn’t the devil that the media were so quick to create, but neither was I the saint I always hoped to become. …I decided that, in order to move myself close to the angels, I would take what happened in my life, try to learn from it, and use it to educate others.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would conduct a thorough review of my own lobbying activities and client relationships to ensure full transparency and disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest.

During the 2014 holiday season, 74.5 million iPhones were sold. Demand like this meant that Apple was in line to make over $52 billion in profits in 2015, the largest annual profit ever generated from a company’s operations. Despite its consistent financial performance year over year, Apple’s robust profit margin hides a more complicated set of business ethics. Similar to many products sold in the U.S., Apple does not manufacture most of its goods domestically. Most of the component sourcing and factory production is done overseas in conditions that critics have argued are dangerous to workers and harmful to the environment.\n\nFor example, tin is a major component in Apple’s products and much of it is sourced in Indonesia. Although there are mines that source tin ethically, there are also many that do not. One study found workers—many of them children—working in unsafe conditions, digging tin out by hand in mines prone to landslides that could bury workers alive. About 70% of the tin used in electronic devices such as smartphones and tablets comes from these more dangerous, small-scale mines. An investigation by the BBC revealed how perilous these working conditions can be. In interviews with miners, a 12-year-old working at the bottom of a 70-foot cliff of sand said: “I worry about landslides. The earth slipping from up there to the bottom. It could happen.”\n\nApple defends its practices by saying it only has so much control over monitoring and regulating its component sources. The company justifies its sourcing practices by saying that it is a complex process, with tens of thousands of miners selling tin, many of them through middle-men. In a statement to the BBC, Apple said “the simplest course of action would be for Apple to unilaterally refuse any tin from Indonesian mines. That would be easy for us to do and would certainly shield us from criticism. But that would also be the lazy and cowardly path, since it would do nothing to improve the situation. We have chosen to stay engaged and attempt to drive changes on the ground.”\n\nIn an effort for greater transparency, Apple has released annual reports detailing their work with suppliers and labor practices.

Roosevelt believed he served the people, not just the government. He took many actions as president that stretched the limits of the executive branch, including the creation of national parks without regard for states’ jurisdiction and fostering revolt in Colombia to establish the Panama Canal.\n\nOn the other hand, William Howard Taft, President of the United States from 1909-1913, embodied what many scholars refer to as a ‘strict constructionist’ model of the presidency. Under this approach, unless the Constitution or Congress explicitly grants a certain power, the president does not have the right to act. In Taft’s words, “the President can exercise no power which cannot be fairly and reasonably traced to some specific grant of power or justly implied and included within such express grant as proper and necessary to its exercise.”\n\nWhile Roosevelt expanded federal power in many areas, Taft felt many of these actions were legal overreaches. For example, as a “trust-buster” Roosevelt differentiated between ‘good’ trusts and ‘bad’ trusts, using his expanded powers as president to make this distinction unilaterally. He made a ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ with U.S. Steel and told them that the American government would not attack their corporation as a monopoly since he believed the company was working in the interests of the American people. Roosevelt did not, however, pass any legislation or make any binding orders to this effect. Taft took a more legalistic view and later, as president, directed his attorney general to file an anti-trust lawsuit against U.S. Steel. Roosevelt took Taft’s actions as a personal attack upon Roosevelt’s presidency and positions.\n\nAlthough Taft continued many of Roosevelt’s policies, he was inclined to look at the facts of the situation and make a choice based on evidence.

Andy Warhol, for example, is well known for appropriating images of Campbell’s soup cans for his pop art. Typically, the original object or image remains recognizable, but the new work of art transforms or recontextualizes the borrowed image or object in order to generate new meaning. Many artists believe that without artistic appropriation, creating new art would not be possible. On the other hand, the line between copyright infringement and fair use is not always clear.\n\nIn 2008, Shepard Fairey appropriated an Associated Press (A.P.) photo of Barack Obama to create his well-known “Hope” image of the presidential candidate. In 2009, Fairey filed a preemptive lawsuit against The A.P., requesting that the court declare protection from any copyright infringement claims on the basis of fair use. Fair use is the copying of copyrighted material for limited “transformative” purposes, such as criticism, parody, or commentary. Fairey acknowledged that his image was based on a 2006 photograph taken by A.P. photographer Mannie Garcia. The A.P. claimed that any use of the photo required permission and asked for credit and compensation.\n\nAnthony T. Falzone, executive director of the Fair Use Project and one of Fairey’s lawyers, said that Fairey only used the original image as a reference and transformed it into a “stunning, abstracted and idealized visual image that created powerful new meaning and conveys a radically different message.” Paul Colford, spokesman for The A.P., said, “[The A.P. was] disappointed by the surprise filing by Shepard Fairey and his company and by Mr. Fairey’s failure to recognize the rights of photographers in their works.” Mannie Garcia argued that he actually owned the copyright to the photo, not The A.P., according to his contract at the time. He stated, “I don’t condone people taking things, just because they can… But in this case I think it’s a very unique situation… If you put all the legal stuff away, I’m so proud of the photograph and that Fairey did what he did artistically with it, and the effect it’s had.”\n\nAfter two years in court, Shepard Fairey and The A.P. settled the case with an undisclosed financial agreement.

In August 2015, President Obama authorized Royal Dutch Shell to expand drilling off Alaska’s northwest coast. His decision brought into sharp relief the different, oftentimes competing views on the expansion of offshore drilling.\n\nMany proponents of offshore drilling argue that tapping into the vast amount of oil and gas reserves in the Arctic will help shore up national security interests for the United States, bolster its economy and workforce, and offer Americans a reliable, safe supply of oil. According to Robert Bryce, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, there are “enormous amounts of recoverable energy resources in the Arctic. The Department of Energy estimates them at something on the order of 400 billion barrels of oil equivalent in natural gas and oil. That’s four times the crude oil reserves of Kuwait.” Framed this way, drilling in the Arctic presents a way for Americans to mitigate risks from dependence on foreign oil and build the local and national economies by creating jobs and supplying cheap oil.\n\nA competing point of view charges that offshore oil drilling poses immense risk to the environment while reinforcing a reliance on dirty, environmentally unfriendly sources of energy. Critics claim that industrial activity associated with offshore drilling in the Arctic could harm native animals, including polar bears, walruses, seals, and whales already jeopardized by climate warming and declining levels of sea ice. Environmentalists argue that oil companies have not demonstrated the capability to clean up an oil spill in water obstructed by ice.

While this law applied to all citizens and all forms of face covering, it became known as France’s “burka bill” because the rhetoric surrounding the bill targeted Muslim women who wore burkas—religious garments covering the face and body—in public.\n\nFrench lawmakers argued that the law was important for the separation of church and state and for the emancipation of women. Similar to the 2004 bill that outlawed the use of conspicuous religious symbols in public schools, including Muslim headscarves and Christian crosses, this law sought to further remove religious expression and iconography from public spaces in France. Some legislators argued that the burka was a harmful symbol of gender inequality that forced women to assume a subservient status to men in public. According to them, the law freed women from a discriminatory, patriarchal subculture.\n\nHowever, some in the French Muslim community saw the bill as an infringement of religious freedom and an act of cultural imperialism. They argued that French legislators were imposing their idea of gender equality onto their culture. Many of them, including some women, argued that wearing burkas actually emancipated women from the physical objectification so common in Western culture. A number of women protested the bill by dressing in burkas and going to the offices of lawmakers who supported the legislation.

He was particularly interested in the causes of Crohn’s disease, an inflammatory bowel disease. After a fellowship at the University of Toronto, Wakefield became a lab researcher at the Royal Free Hospital in London in 1988.\n\nWakefield developed a theory that the measles virus caused Crohn’s disease and formed an “Inflammatory Bowel Disease Study Group.” In May of 1995, the distraught mother of an autistic child phoned Wakefield and suggested that her son’s condition had been caused by the measles virus in the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. Of interest to Wakefield was the fact that the child also apparently suffered from symptoms consistent with inflammatory bowel disease, which the mother suspected were also caused by the MMR vaccine. Wakefield and his team began to study the mother’s hypothesis. From July 1996 to February 1997, the team solicited referral letters from doctors of children who appeared to have both autism and inflammatory bowel issues. Ultimately, the team studied twelve children.\n\nOn February 28, 1998, the “team” published an article in the prestigious medical journal, The Lancet. The article listed twelve co-authors but was actually solely written by Wakefield. It proposed a potential link between the MMR vaccine and a bowel-brain “syndrome” causing both “regressive autism” (where children lost abilities such as speech that they had once had) and Crohn’s disease. Even before publication of the article, Wakefield had told the press that the results of his research “clearly confirm our suspicions.” At a press conference following publication, Wakefield said: “I cannot support the continued use of the three vaccines given together. My concerns are that one more case of this is too many.” The article attracted much publicity and had a significant effect on the public’s views regarding vaccination. What was unknown at that time included:\n\n- On February 19, 1996, Wakefield had agreed to be a well-paid consultant to attorney Richard Barr who had been awarded a contract by the British Legal Aid Board to potentially file a class action lawsuit over the MMR vaccine.\n\n- Barr and Wakefield had developed a list of things that Wakefield’s research needed to show in order to be helpful to Barr’s lawsuit even before the study began.\n\n- Barr largely funded Wakefield’s research project using government funds allocated to the lawsuit.\n\n- Many of the twelve children in the study had ties to Barr or to anti-vaccine groups; they had gone to the hospital with their parents already intent upon suing the vaccine makers.\n\n- To gather information for the study, Wakefield and his team subjected the twelve children to endoscopies, a procedure that was “high risk,” even though many of the children had no medical need for the procedure. Wakefield did not disclose that his team did not have ethics committee approval to perform these risky, unnecessary procedures.\n\n- In June 1996, Wakefield filed patent applications for:\n\n  - A single measles vaccine\n\n  - A treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, and\n\n  - A treatment for autism\n\n- Members of Wakefield’s research team often spoke giddily of the Nobel Prize they would win and Wakefield himself aspired to be the greatest gastroenterologist ever.\n\nWakefield had previously formed companies (1991, 1993, 1994) to commercially exploit his scientific discoveries, but none had succeeded. Nonetheless, soon after publication of The Lancet article, Wakefield met with potential investors to form a company to sell products (e.g., an alternative measles vaccine) that he planned to develop in this area. His projections for revenue and profit potential were aggressively optimistic, depending largely on Barr’s litigation succeeding. He negotiated to give the school a piece of his projected action in return for certain benefits, including a title for himself as “professor.” The school refused to give Wakefield that title.\n\nIn October of 1998, Barr filed the first court claims. Wakefield was to be Barr’s primary expert witness and pretended to be an independent scientist. In 1999, when shortcomings in Wakefield’s study came to light (very small number of subjects, subjects not chosen randomly, no comparison group of non-autistic children, heavy reliance on parents’ memories and beliefs, etc.), his university asked him to replicate his research results with a “gold standard” scientific study. Wakefield readily agreed to do so, but never even began such a study. Ultimately, he refused additional replication requests.\n\nIn 2000, Wakefield testified in Washington D.C. before a congressional committee regarding the dangers of the MMR vaccine. Another witness was John O’Leary, an Irish pathologist. Neither disclosed that they were business partners nor that O’Leary was also being supported financially by lawyer Barr. By October 2003, the flaws in Wakefield’s study were sufficiently apparent that Barr’s MMR lawsuit was dismissed for lack of evidence. The government money stopped flowing, but Barr and his staff had already received $51m in current U.S. dollars and Wakefield had received $846,000 in today’s dollars, plus expenses (roughly eight times his medical school salary).\n\nSoon thereafter, journalist Brian Deer — whose book *The Doctor Who Fooled the World* provides virtually all the material for this case study — began thoroughly investigating Wakefield and his research. As litigation involving Wakefield and his colleagues proceeded, documents related to Wakefield’s study in The Lancet came to light, showing that the article inaccurately described the conditions of every single one of the twelve subjects. Some were described as having autism when medical records showed that they did not. Some were described as having Crohn’s disease, when medical records showed that they did not. Others were described as having developed autism soon after having received the MMR vaccine, while medical records showed that they had manifested signs of autism before being vaccinated. And so on.\n\nAlthough the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals clearly require that third-party funding and expert witness work must be disclosed as conflicts of interest, Wakefield said that he did not agree. On May 3, 2004, 10 of 12 co-authors on The Lancet article repudiated the paper’s conclusions. Ultimately, after a long hearing, the General Medical Council canceled Wakefield’s medical registration.\n\nNone of this prevented Wakefield from becoming the darling of the anti-vaccine set and creating significant vaccine hesitancy regarding the MMR vaccine (and others).

In an interview with GQ, he stated that he co-wrote “Blurred Lines.” But in court, he claimed that he was too high in the studio, and that Williams had in fact composed the song, and he had lied earlier in order to get credit. Williams claimed that, although Gaye’s music had influenced him in his youth, he did not copy Gaye’s song in his composition.\n\nIn March 2015, the jury ruled in favor of the Gaye estate, stating that while Williams and Thicke did not directly copy “Got to Give It Up,” there was enough of a similar “feel” to warrant copyright infringement. Gaye’s heirs were awarded $7.4 million in damages, the largest amount ever granted in a music copyright case.\n\nWhile many commentators agreed with this verdict, others were concerned that it could negatively affect songwriting within an entire genre. Musicologist Robert Fink, for example, stated that this verdict had the potential to set a precedent for “fencing off our shared heritage of sounds, grooves, vibes, tunes, and feels.” Musicians, artists, and writers often note that previous works influence them in their creative process, and that there is very little that is completely original. Thicke and Williams did not see the musical influence of Gaye as copyright infringement, but rather as inspiration that spurred them to create a new, original single."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would advise Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams to respect the court's decision and pay the $7.4 million in damages to the Gaye estate as ruled by the jury.

In its modern Spanish style, bullfighting first became a prominent cultural event in the early 18th century. Yet despite its cultural significance, bullfighting continues to face increasing scrutiny in light of animal rights issues.\n\nSome people consider bullfighting a cruel sport in which the bull suffers a severe and tortuous death. Many animal rights activists often protest bullfighting in Spain and other countries, citing the needless endangerment of the bull and bullfighter. Some cities around the world where bullfighting was once popular, including Coslada (Spain), Mouans-Sartoux (France), and Teocelo (Mexico), have even declared themselves to be anti-bullfighting cities. Other places, including some towns in Catalonia (Spain), have ceased killing the bull in the fight, but continue bullfighting.\n\nTo other people, the spectacle of the bullfight is not mere sport. The event is not only culturally significant, but also a fine art in which the bullfighter is trained in a certain style and elicits emotion through the act of the fight. Writer Alexander Fiske-Harrison, in his research and training as a bullfighter, defends the practice and circumstances of the bull, “In terms of animal welfare, the fighting bull lives four to six years whereas the meat cow lives one to two. …Those years are spent free roaming…” And others similarly argue that the death of the bull in the ring is more humane than the death of animals in a slaughterhouse."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would conduct a thorough investigation into the treatment and welfare of the bulls used in bullfighting.

In the area of organic food alone, data from the Organic Trade Association reveals that consumer demand in the United States has seen double-digit growth every year since 1990. In 2014, the organic food market reached almost $40 billion in sales. Consumers of these products tend to be seen in a more positive light—they are deemed more ethical, more altruistic, and kinder than people who do not buy green products. But is there another side to this kind of consumer behavior?\n\nIn a series of experiments comparing consumption of green and “conventional” products, psychologists Nina Mazar and Chen-Bo Zhong demonstrated that those people who bought green products—like eco-friendly laundry detergent or organic yogurt—were less likely to share money with a stranger, more likely to cheat on a task in which they could earn money, and more likely to steal money when they thought they would not get caught. As the psychologists stated, “purchasing green products may license indulgence in self-interested and unethical behaviors.”\n\nMazar and Zhong, whose study received considerable media attention in their native Canada, as well as in American and British publications, said the results surprised them. Initially, they expected green products to provide a halo effect, whereby the positive impressions associated with green consumption would lead to positive outcomes in other areas. “Given that green products are manifestations of high ethical standards and humanitarian considerations, mere exposure [to them would] activate norms of social responsibility and ethical conduct,” said Mazar and Zhong in an interview.\n\nBut as the results indicate, the opposite can be true. “The message of this research is that actions which produce a sense of self content and moral glow can sometimes backfire,” Mazar stated in another interview.\n\nThese patterns have been shown to extend to other shopping scenarios. For example, one study tracked scanner data and shopper receipts at a California grocery store. Those shoppers who brought reusable grocery bags with them were more likely to buy environmentally friendly products, like organic food. But they were also more likely to buy indulgent products, like ice cream, cookies, candy, and cake. The researchers followed up this study with a series of experiments that showed these moral licensing effects only happened when the decision to bring the reusable bags was at the shopper’s discretion. When shoppers were told that the store required customers to use cloth bags, licensing effects disappeared and customers chose not to buy indulgent products.

The researchers argued that the use of human cadavers was necessary to study the actual effects of these crashes on the body. They insisted that the research would save lives because it would help engineers design safer cars.\n\nThere was significant public outcry against this practice from numerous groups. The ADAC, Germany’s largest automobile club, issued a statement challenging the research on ethical grounds:\n\n> “In an age when experiments on animals are being put into question, such tests must be carried out on dummies and not on children’s cadavers.”\n\nRudolph Hammerschmidt, spokesman for the Roman Catholic German Bishops’ Conference, similarly decried the practice, arguing:\n\n> “Even the dead possess human dignity…this research should be done with manikins.”\n\nPolitical leaders also weighed in on the debate.

His skills and judgment led him to be promoted, and he became the Cardinals’ scouting director in charge of the amateur draft.\n\nIn 2011, two of Correa’s colleagues, who were higher up in the Cardinal’s management, left the team to take top jobs with a rival team – the Houston Astros. Jeff Luhnow became the Astros’ general manager and Sig Mejdal took the job of director of decisions sciences. Correa now says that he was worried that these men might have taken important information, including data and algorithms that the Cardinals had spent a lot of time and money to develop, to the Astros. And he thought they might be using the information against the Cardinals.\n\nOne day, Correa guessed Mejdal’s password and used it to hack into the Astros’ webmail system. He accessed the Astros’ webmail at least 48 times (sometimes for as long as two hours at a time) over the next few years. He stole information, such as the Astros’ scouting reports, draft rankings, and trade discussions. Correa also took steps to cover up his actions. But eventually, he was discovered. In 2014, it appears that Correa leaked internal Astros’ trade talk notes to the prominent sports blog Deadspin, which caused the Astros to realize that their system had been compromised.\n\nThe FBI was called in. After some investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice charged Correa with five violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Correa pled guilty in early 2016 and was sentenced to 46 months in prison. He was ordered to pay the Astros $279,038 in restitution. Later, the Major League Baseball (MLB) Commissioner, Rob Manfred, imposed a lifetime ban on Correa from working in MLB. Manfred also fined the Cardinals $2 million, although there is no solid evidence that anyone other than Correa was involved in the hacking.\n\nAt his sentencing, Correa signed a document admitting that he had caused $1.7 million worth of losses to the Astros. However, whatever damage Correa did failed to prevent the Astros from being one of MLB’s best teams from (at least) 2016 to 2022.

The school was in a run-down neighborhood three miles south of downtown that was plagued by armed robberies. Lewis himself had grown up in a violent neighborhood. He empathized with his students and was devoted to their success. A colleague described Lewis as a “star teacher” and a “very hard worker, who will go the extra mile.”\n\nLewis was a teacher when Beverly Hall was Atlanta’s school superintendent. Hall believed that business approaches and the values of the market system could save public education. She set accountability measures for the Atlanta school district and created performance objectives that were tougher than those of No Child Left Behind, the federal program that became law in 2002. Teacher evaluations were linked to students’ performance on standardized tests. Schools whose students did not make appropriate progress toward the standardized test goals received escalating sanctions that culminated in replacement of the faculty and staff, and restructuring or closing of the school.\n\nParks Middle School was in dire straits because it had been classified as “a school in need of improvement” for the previous five years. Unless 58 percent of students passed the math portion of the standardized test and 67 percent passed the language arts portion, Parks Middle School could be closed down. Its students would be separated and bussed across town to different schools.\n\n“[It] was my sole obligation to never let that happen,” Lewis later told Rachel Aviv in an article about these events in The New Yorker. Lewis had pushed his students to work harder than they ever had in preparing for the test. But he knew that it would be very difficult for many of them to pass. Christopher Waller, the new principal of Parks, had heard that teachers in the elementary schools that fed into Parks had changed their students’ answers on the standardized tests under the guise of erasing stray pencil marks. Waller asked Lewis and other teachers to do the same. Lewis found the exams of students who needed to get a few more questions right in order to pass. He changed their answers. If he did not change their scores, Lewis feared that his students would lapse into “why try” attitudes. They would lose their neighborhood school and the community that had developed within it.\n\nThanks to Lewis and other teachers, Parks students did better than ever on the standardized tests. Neekisia Jackson, a former student at Parks at the time, recalled, “Everyone was jumping up and down,” after a teacher announced the school had met the goals of No Child Left Behind for the first time. Jackson continued, “We had heard what everyone was saying: ‘Y’all aren’t good enough.’ Now we could finally go to school with our heads held high.”\n\nThe same process of changing answers continued at Parks through 2010. By that time, nine other teachers were helping Lewis change answers.\n\nIn October of 2010, 50 agents of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation visited Parks and other Atlanta schools. The investigators concluded that teachers and administrators at 44 schools had cheated in the manner that Lewis had. In July of 2012, 110 teachers who had confessed or been accused of cheating were placed on administrative leave, including Lewis. Later that year, Lewis’ employment was terminated.\n\nThis case study is based on an article by Rachel Aviv entitled, “Wrong answer: In an era of high-stakes testing, a struggling school made a shocking choice,” that appeared in The New Yorker on July 21, 2014."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would have refused to change the students' answers on the standardized tests, even if pressured by the principal or other teachers to do so.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nIn baseball, catchers signal to pitchers which type of pitch to throw. Usually, catchers do this by holding down a certain number of fingers on their non-gloved hand between their legs as they crouch behind the plate. It is typically not as simple as just one finger for a fastball and two for a curve, but not a lot more complicated than that.\n\nIn September 2016, an intern for the Houston Astros major league baseball (MLB) team named Derek Vigoa showed Astros’ general manager Jeff Luhnow a PowerPoint presentation. It featured an Excel-based application programmed with an algorithm that could decode the pitching signs that opposing teams’ catchers flashed to their pitchers. The Astros called it “Codebreaker.” One organization employee referred to the sign-stealing system that evolved as the “dark arts.”\n\nMLB rules allowed a runner standing on second base to do what he could to steal signs and relay them to the batter. But MLB rules strictly forbade using electronic means to decipher and signal signs. The Astros “Codebreaker” violated these rules.\n\nAccording to Wall Street Journal writer Jared Diamond:\n\n> The way Codebreaker worked was simple: Somebody would watch an in-game live feed and log the catcher’s signals into the spreadsheet, as well as the type of pitch that was actually thrown. With that information, Codebreaker determined how the signs corresponded with different pitches. Once decided, that information would be communicated through intermediaries to a baserunner, who would relay them to the hitter.\n\n> Starting around June 2017, the system was embellished by Astros players. They started watching a live game feed on a monitor near the dugout and then would bang on a trash can to communicate the coming pitch to the batter. The “banging scheme” lasted through the 2017 World Series, which the Astros won over the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nLate in the 2017 season, MLB caught the Boston Red Sox relaying signs from their video room to an Apple watch worn by a trainer sitting in the dugout. Commissioner Rob Manfred fined the Red Sox and issued a strong warning to all teams against illegal electronic sign-stealing. It was suspected (accurately, as it turns out) that the New York Yankees had also been using technology to steal signs in 2015 and 2016. Despite these incidences, and the MLB warning, the Astros continue with “Codebreaker.”\n\nThe Astros’ scheme lasted into the 2018 season, in road games as well as home games, even though other teams were very suspicious that the Astros were stealing signs. Other teams often changed their own signs several times a game in an attempt to thwart the suspected sign stealing by the Astros. An executive for an opposing team was quoted as saying “The whole industry knows they’ve been cheating their asses off for three or four years. Everybody knew it.” Indeed, many teams had complained to MLB’s executives about the Astros’ cheating. Some suspect the cheating continued through the 2019 season, though others think not.\n\nFor the uninitiated, sign-stealing might not seem like it would give a big advantage. After all, even if a batter knows that a certain pitch is coming, he still has to hit it. It can’t be easy hitting a 100-mph fastball or a major league-caliber slider, even if you know it’s coming. Nonetheless, the advantage is substantial. According to the Washington Nationals’ pitching coach Paul Menhart, “It’s the worst feeling in the world stepping on that mound and having an idea that the hitter knows what’s coming. It’s one of the most unnerving feelings. You feel helpless. You just get ticked off to the point where you lose total focus and confidence.”\n\nThere is no question that many of the Astros players were actively involved in the scheme. The Astros manager, AJ Hinch, clearly knew about it. There is substantial, though perhaps not airtight evidence, that General Manager Rob Luhnhow also knew. Carlos Beltran, a Hall-of-Fame caliber player near the end of his 20-year playing career, was a leader in the scheme. Bench coach Alex Cora was a primary instigator. Owner Jim Crane appears not to have known of the dark arts being practiced by his club.\n\nThe scandal became public on November 12, 2019, when former Astros’ pitcher Mike Fiers blew the whistle in an interview published in “The Athletic.” MLB then launched an investigation that granted the Astros players immunity in return for their fessing up. Commissioner Rob Manfred soon issued a nine-page report that found that most of the Astros players knew of the scheme and many participated in it. The report also found that manager Hinch knew of the scheme and that GM Luhnow should have prevented it. Manfred suspended both Hinch and Luhnow, who were quickly fired by Astros’ owner Crane. MLB fined the Astros $5 million and stripped the club of its first- and second-round draft picks in both 2020 and 2021. Cora and Beltran lost managing jobs they had acquired.\n\nThe damage done by the Astros is significant. As veteran catcher Stephen Vogt said, “The integrity of our game is what we have, and now that’s been broken.” Former major-leaguer Doug Glanville concluded that MLB now faces an “existential crisis” saying that the Astros’ “selfish act makes everyone question the validity of the future and the truth of the past.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If I were in this situation, I would immediately report the sign-stealing scheme known as \"Codebreaker\" to the appropriate authorities within the Houston Astros organization, such as the team owner Jim Crane or the MLB commissioner's office.

The student-athlete was about to enter his freshman year at UNC—in the fall of 2007—yet he took an upper-level class before completing a 100- or 200-level course. A syllabus for the summer course did not exist. Most freshmen at UNC were not typically allowed to take 400-level courses without special permission from professors or advanced placement.\n\nThis and other cases were part of the evidence in allegations of academic fraud against UNC in a report released by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 2015. The report references “unchecked” coursework in which many student-athletes at UNC enrolled in fraudulent classes in the AFAM department or were given special advantages over the course of 18 years. As the report stated, “These were classes that involved no interaction with a faculty member, required no class attendance or course work other than a single paper, and resulted in consistently high grades.”\n\nJulius Nyang’oro, professor and department chair of AFAM, oversaw this system. Deborah Crowder, who was a secretary with the department, operated the “paper” classes, often categorized as independent study courses. Several counselors in UNC’s Office of Academic Support Program for Student Athletes also knew of these classes. In some cases, the counselors steered students to them. These courses enabled student-athletes with poor academic performance to continue to be eligible to play sports. The courses were also open to non-athletes and became popular among fraternity members.\n\nUltimately, the scheme became so brazen that an academic counselor wrote an e-mail to Ms. Crowder that said: “Hi, Debby. Yes, a D will be fine; that’s all she needs. I didn’t look at the paper but figured out it was a recycled one as well, but I couldn’t figure out from where! Thanks for whatever you can do.”\n\nMany of the staff members implicated in the allegations were named by Mary Willingham, a learning specialist at UNC who went public with details about the ongoing operations. “I was part of something that I came to be ashamed of,” she said, “We weren’t serving the kids. We weren’t educating them properly. We were pushing them toward graduation, and that’s not the same as giving them an education.”\n\nThe concern over giving student-athletes an education raised larger questions about the balance between strong academics and strong athletics at major universities. Richard Southall, director of the College Sport Research Institute at the University of South Carolina, stated, “We pretend that it’s feasible to recruit high school graduates with minimal academic qualifications, give them a full-time job as a football or basketball player at a Division I NCAA school, and somehow have them get up to college-level reading and writing skills at the same time that they’re enrolled in college-level classes.” He added, “We’re kidding ourselves.”\n\nThe Southern Association of Colleges and Schools accreditation organization placed UNC on probation for one year. UNC instituted reforms with higher governance standards, accountability for student-athlete support programs, and classroom and coursework audits. In 2017, the NCAA concluded its investigation. While the organization agreed that UNC was guilty of academic fraud, it did not punish the university or its athletic program.

Federal law states that “any justice or judge shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might be questioned.” Critics of Justice Scalia thought it reasonable to question his impartiality. Stephen Gillers, a New York University law professor and expert on legal ethics, noted:\n\n> “A judge may have a friendship with a lawyer, and that’s fine. But if the lawyer has a case before the judge, they don’t socialize until it’s over. That shows a proper respect for maintaining the public’s confidence in the integrity of the process.”\n\nDefenders of Justice Scalia argued that these criticisms were politically motivated by people who wished that Scalia not be able to vote in the case. They said it is common for justices to be friends with political actors who might be involved in cases coming before the Court. Defending his actions, Scalia stated:\n\n> “Social contacts with high-level executive officials…have never been thought improper for judges who may have before them cases in which those people are involved… For example, Supreme Court Justices are regularly invited to dine at the White House, whether or not a suit seeking to compel or prevent certain presidential action is pending.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would recommend that Justice Scalia recuse himself from the case to avoid any appearance of bias or impropriety.

Public outcry criticized Fallin for appropriating Native American cultures, sparking uproar on social media and leading to protests at their shows.\n\nIn response, Fallin and Pink Pony removed the photo and released a statement on their Facebook page explaining their aesthetic appreciation for Native American culture. Fallin told the Indian Country Today Media Network that, “I think Native American culture is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, so I was naturally drawn to it.” Musician Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips became involved in the issue when he fired bandmate Kliph Scurlock for criticizing Fallin online. To show his support for Fallin, Coyne posted Instagram photos of several friends and a dog wearing headdresses.\n\nSome argue that Fallin’s photo could be an example of artistic appropriation. Throughout history, artists have borrowed objects and images from everyday life as well as other cultures in order to re-contextualize the object in a new manner. On the other hand, some argue that non-Native Americans do not have the right to adorn a headdress at all. Taking a sacred or meaningful object out of context is problematic even when touted as “art.” Summer Morgan, member of the Kiowa tribe in Oklahoma, believes that Fallin may have had good intentions, but there are better ways to express her appreciation of Native American cultures. Morgan believes that headdresses are not fashion accessories. Following Kiowa tradition, only men can own war bonnets and each feather represents a war deed.

First, the fact that a deal was struck at all was a major accomplishment, given the failure of previous climate change talks. Second, unlike previous climate change accords that focused exclusively on developed countries, this pact committed both developed and developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the voluntary targets established by nations in the Paris climate deal fall considerably short of what many scientists deem necessary to achieve the stated goal of the negotiations: limiting the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, since the established targets are voluntary, they may be lowered or abandoned due to political resistance, short-term economic crises, or simply social fatigue or disinterest.\n\nAs philosophy professor Stephen Gardiner aptly explains, the challenge of climate change presents the world with several fundamental ethical dilemmas. It is simultaneously a profoundly global, intergenerational, and philosophical problem. First, from a global perspective, climate change presents the world with a collective action problem: all countries have a collective interest in controlling global carbon emissions. But each individual country also has incentives to over-consume (in this case, to emit as much carbon as necessary) in response to societal demands for economic growth and prosperity.\n\nSecond, as an intergenerational problem, the consequences of actions taken by the current generation will have the greatest impact on future generations yet to be born. Thus, the current generation must forego benefits today in order to protect against possibly catastrophic costs in the future. This tradeoff is particularly difficult for developing countries. They must somehow achieve economic growth in the present to break out of a persistent cycle of poverty, while limiting the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted into the atmosphere to protect future generations. The fact that prosperous, developed countries (such as the U.S. and those in Europe) arguably created the current climate problems during their previous industrial economic development in the 19th and 20th centuries complicates the tradeoffs between economic development and preventing further climate change.\n\nFinally, the global and intergenerational nature of climate change points to the underlying philosophical dimensions of the problem. While it is intuitive that the current generation has some ethical responsibility to leave an inhabitable world to future generations, the extent of this obligation is less clear. The same goes for individual countries who have pledged to reduce carbon emissions to help protect environmental health, but then face real economic and social costs when executing those pledges. Developing nations faced with these costs may encounter further challenges as the impact of climate change will most likely fall disproportionally on the poor, thus also raising issues of fairness and inequality."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would work towards raising awareness about the importance of the Paris climate agreement and the urgency of taking stronger actions to combat climate change.

Even the Queen of England had an account there. In 1989, Nick Leeson was hired at Barings, where he prospered. He was quickly promoted to the trading floor and appointed manager in Singapore where he traded on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX). Leeson was an aggressive trader, making large profits in speculative trading. In 1993, his profits constituted almost 10% of Barings’ total profits. He had developed a reputation for expertise, for near-infallibility, and his superiors in London gave him little supervision.\n\nIn July 1992, a new Barings employee suffered a small loss on Leeson’s watch. Leeson did not wish to lose his reputation for infallibility, or his job, so he hid the loss in an error account. Leeson attempted to make back the loss through speculative trading, but this led to even bigger losses, which again were hidden in this account. He kept doubling up his bets in an attempt to get out from under the losses. Leeson later said:\n\n> “[I] wanted to shout from the rooftops…this is what the situation is, there are massive losses, I want to stop. But for some reason you’re unable to do it. … I had this catastrophic secret which was burning up inside me—yet…I simply couldn’t open my mouth and say, ‘I’ve lost millions and millions of pounds.’”\n\nLeeson took out a short-term, highly leveraged bet on the Nikkei index in Japan. At the same time, a severe earthquake in Kobe, Japan sent the index plummeting, and his loss was so huge that he could no longer hide it. Barings, a 233-year old bank, collapsed overnight and was bought by ING for £1. Leeson fled to Malaysia, Thailand, and finally to Germany, where he was arrested and extradited to Singapore.

Starting as an assistant coach at a small town, his intelligence, drive, attention to detail, and creativity led him to head coaching jobs at larger and larger schools. He turned a floundering program at Stephenville High School into a powerhouse that won multiple state championships and intimidated even much larger high schools’ football teams.\n\nNot without ambition, Briles then took an assistant coaching job at Texas Tech University and soon became a successful head coach at the University of Houston. Then, he took the top job at Baylor University. Baylor is an “unambiguously Christian” university. Its website read (at the time): “In a world where faith is often the casualty of a serious pursuit of academic achievement, Baylor is a special case.” Baylor’s chancellor and president, Ken Starr, was an enthusiastic promoter of Christian values. Baylor’s athletic director, Ian McCaw, was described by former Clemson football coach Tommy Bowden as a “fine Christian man.”\n\nBriles seemed like a good fit for Baylor. As Briles often explains, his Christian faith is very important to him. A columnist wrote that Briles was “polite, courteous, and respectful in a way that harkens back to a different era. He is a good man with a good family.” Baylor used its Christian values, as embodied in its Christian leaders, as a lure to recruit students and student-athletes.\n\nIn 2008, Briles began as Baylor’s head football coach with the goal of ending a 12-year-string of losing records. It was a struggle during the first two years. But Briles’ recruiting ability, coaching acumen, and endless energy soon revived the dormant program. In 2010, Baylor had a winning record and went to its first of six straight bowl games. Soon after, Baylor became a team that was annually in the conversation for the nation’s best team. Baylor sent numerous players to the NFL and their quarterback, Robert Griffin III, won the Heisman trophy.\n\nOn the surface, all seemed well on the Baylor campus, especially at its brand-new $266 million football stadium. The campus was abuzz with energy and excitement over the football team’s success, which is not surprising in Texas. In 2013, Nick Eatman published *Art Briles: Looking Up: My Journey from Tragedy to Triumph*. And in 2014, Briles wrote and published an autobiography, *Beating Goliath: My Story of Football and Faith*.\n\nBut all was not well on the Baylor campus. In November 2014, Briles published his autobiography and the football team went 11-2. Baylor rose to as high as #4 in the national rankings. The same year, Patty Crawford was named Baylor’s first full-time Title IX coordinator. In her first two years in that role, Crawford received 400 reports of sexual harassment, violence, and assault. Seventeen of those victims made complaints of sexual assault or domestic violence against nineteen football players, including four alleged gang rapes. Crawford said that cases involving football players involved 10% of her caseload even though football players constituted only 4% of the student body. Lawsuits later alleged 52 rapes by 31 football players from 2011 to 2014.\n\nAccording to Paula Lavigne and Mark Schlabach in their book *Violated: Exposing Rape at Baylor University Amid College Football’s Sexual Assault Crisis*, Crawford said (regarding the gang rapes): “…the younger guys saw what was happening and that no one ever got in trouble for it, and the behavior continued. ‘It was just this weird mentality at Baylor that I haven’t seen anywhere else.’”\n\nThroughout Briles’ tenure at Baylor, women were assaulted by football players. Not much was done if these women complained to the university. This, of course, discouraged others from complaining so the incidents piled up.\n\nThe evidence indicates that Baylor’s chancellor Starr was largely unaware of what was going on. His fault lay primarily in not giving attention to ensuring that Baylor was meeting its Title IX obligations to police, investigate, and punish such wrongdoing. As president and chancellor, this was ultimately Starr’s obligation.\n\nBriles mostly claimed ignorance. He apologized to the board of regents for not knowing what was going on, although there was quite a bit of evidence that he did know. Many students and parents claimed to have made complaints to the football program. But Briles, who seemed to have a good memory when he wrote his autobiography, repeatedly said that he had no memory of complaints, messages, or conversations that victims claimed occurred. But e-mails and text messages surfaced which showed that Briles often knew of complaints and did his best to ensure that they were kept quiet rather than alert university officials in the Title IX office as he was supposed to do. Baylor’s athletic director McCaw sometimes did the same.\n\nIn one instance, a football player was arrested for assaulting and threatening to kill a male student (a non-athlete). In response, Briles and McCaw exchanged these messages:\n\n> **BRILES**: Just talked to [the player]—he said Waco PD was there—said they were going to keep it quiet—Wasn’t a set up deal… I’ll get shill [Baylor director of football operations Colin Shillinglaw] to ck on Sibley [a defense attorney often used by Baylor football players].\n>\n> **McCAW**: That would be great if they kept it quiet!\n\nWhen these cases began showing up in the press, Baylor could no longer play the silent game. The Board of Regents took charge and hired a law firm, Pepper Hamilton, to investigate. Its report was not pretty. Among other factual conclusions that the Board reached after reviewing the Pepper Hamilton report (which it refused to release to the public) were these:\n\n> Baylor failed to maintain effective oversight and supervision of the Athletics Department as it related to the effective implementation of Title IX. Leadership challenges and communication issues hindered enforcement of rules and policies, and created a cultural perception that football was above the rules….\n>\n> Baylor failed to take appropriate action to respond to reports of sexual assault and dating violence reportedly committed by football players. The choices made by football staff and athletics leadership, in some instances, posed a risk to campus safety and the integrity of the University. In certain instances, including reports of a sexual assault by multiple football players, athletics and football personnel affirmatively chose not to report sexual violence and dating violence to an appropriate administrator outside of athletics. In those instances, football coaches or staff met directly with a complainant and/or a parent of a complainant and did not report the misconduct. As a result, no action was taken to support complainants, fairly and impartially evaluate the conduct under Title IX, address identified cultural concerns within the football program or protect campus safety once aware of a potential pattern of sexual violence by multiple football players.\n\nIn addition, some football coaches and staff took improper steps in response to disclosures of sexual assault or dating violence that precluded the University from fulfilling its legal obligations. Football staff conducted their own untrained internal inquiries, outside of policy, which improperly discredited complainants and denied them the right to a fair, impartial and informed investigation, interim measures or processes promised under University Policy. In some cases, internal steps gave the illusion of responsiveness to complainants but failed to provide a meaningful institutional response under Title IX. Further, because reports were not shared outside of athletics, the University missed critical opportunities to impose appropriate disciplinary action that would have removed offenders from campus and possibly precluded future acts of sexual violence against Baylor students. In some instances, the football program dismissed players for unspecified team violations and assisted them in transferring to other schools….\n\nIn addition to the failures related to sexual assault and dating violence, individuals within the football program actively sought to maintain internal control over discipline for other forms of misconduct. Athletics personnel failed to recognize the conflicts of interest in roles and the risk to campus safety by insulating athletes from student conduct processes. Football coaches and staff took affirmative steps to maintain internal control over discipline of players and to actively divert cases from the student conduct or criminal processes. In some cases, football coaches and staff had inappropriate involvement in disciplinary and criminal matters or engaged in improper conduct that reinforced an overall perception that football was above the rules, and that there was no culture of accountability for misconduct.\n\nThe regents ultimately fired or forced the resignations of Starr, McCaw, and Briles."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would report the findings of the Pepper Hamilton investigation to the appropriate authorities, including law enforcement and the relevant regulatory bodies.

Jane Clementi, Tyler’s mother, stated:\n\n> “In this digital world, we need to teach our youngsters that their actions have consequences, that their words have real power to hurt or to help.

Although most people are free to speak their minds online, public figures face unique challenges.

Many Napster users shared music files with each other, but without any compensation to the artists and producers who made the music, sparking a series of legal battles over copyright and distribution. In 2001, an appellate panel upheld a previous ruling that Napster violated copyright laws, stating that:\n\n> “Repeated and exploitative unauthorized copies of copyrighted works were made to save the expense of purchasing authorized copies.”\n\nArtists were divided on the benefits and harms of Napster. Over 70 artists formed “Artists Against Piracy” in coalition with major record companies to combat the piracy occurring on Napster and other peer-to-peer internet services. In contrast, some established artists such as Neil Young saw piracy as the “new radio” and applauded the potential to reach larger audiences and drive additional sales through increased popularity. Seeing both the benefits and detriments of piracy, singer Norah Jones stated:\n\n> “If people hear it I’m happy…it’s great that young people who don’t have a lot of money can listen to music and be exposed to new things… But I also understand it’s not ideal for the record industry, and a lot of young artists who won’t make any [money] off their album sales, but at least they can tour.”\n\nAlthough court rulings forced Napster to terminate its file-sharing business, Napster’s innovations stimulated payment-based services, such as iTunes, Pandora, and many others. But the availability of such services has not put an end to the debate surrounding artist compensation with digital music, as seen with Taylor Swift’s open letter to Apple in 2015. Swift’s albums, along with the music of many other artists, were going to be streamed at no cost to new Apple Music customers over the first three months of service without any compensation to the artists. In her open letter, Swift stated:\n\n> “I’m not sure you know that Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months.

What began as an article about a unique new golf putter gradually became an article about the inventor of the putter, Dr. Essay Anne Vanderbilt. In his investigation into Vanderbilt’s invention, Hannan discovered that Vanderbilt had lied about her academic background and work experience and had taken cash from an investor that she never returned.\n\nHannan also found out that Vanderbilt was a transgender woman and outed her as trans to an investor. Although Hannan had made an agreement with Vanderbilt to focus the story “on the science, not the scientist,” the putter became a backdrop to a story about what Hannan saw as a deceitful personal life and fraudulent professional career. Vanderbilt, who wished to maintain her privacy from the start, did not want the story published. A few months before Grantland published the article, Vanderbilt committed suicide.\n\nThe article sparked immediate controversy over the merits and ethics of its reporting, as well as its role in Vanderbilt’s suicide. Detractors criticized Hannan and Grantland for a lack of awareness and compassion regarding trans issues. Defenders of the article saw value in the story and believed it would be dangerous to not report all of the facts. In an editorial response published in Grantland, sports journalist Christina Kahrl wrote, “It was not Grantland’s job to out [Vanderbilt],” noting, “she was a member of a community…for whom suicide attempts outpace the national average almost 26 times over.” Josh Levin, executive editor at Slate, wrote:\n\n“The fact that Dr. V once lived under a different name is not irrelevant to Hannan’s story… But presenting Dr. V’s gender identity as one in a series of lies and elisions was a careless editorial decision. …Dr. V is a con artist and a trans woman. Hannan, though, conflates those two facts…”\n\nJournalist James Kirchick defended Hannan, writing:\n\n“What I saw was a careful and ingenious reporter ferret out a fraud with care. …[There’s] no evidence that Hannan was…seeking to “out” and humiliate a transgender woman… On the contrary, in his article, Hannan arrives at a conclusion sympathetic to Vanderbilt.”\n\nTrans advocate and medical doctor Dana Beyer said that the article reflected the tragedy of being in the closet as trans, but did not revel in it or have malicious intentions.\n\nSeveral days after the publication of the article, Grantland editor-in-chief Bill Simmons published a response to the article’s criticism. He wrote:\n\n“I didn’t know nearly enough about the transgender community—and neither does my staff… We just didn’t see the other side. We weren’t sophisticated enough. In the future, we will be sophisticated enough… we made mistakes, and we’re going to learn from them.”\n\nReflecting on the article over a year later, Hannan spoke about the complexities of seeking truth in journalism:\n\n“At every point in the reporting I could justify myself going forward… ‘I’m doing my job.’ But part of the job was to assess whether it was worth it.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Given the scenario, I would take the following specific actions:\n\n1.

East Germany (the German Democratic Republic—GDR) became part of the Eastern Bloc under the USSR's influence, while West Germany aligned with the U.S. and Western Europe. Facing economic struggles and mass defections to the West, the GDR built the Berlin Wall to prevent its citizens from leaving.\n\nIn the 1960s, the GDR government aimed to showcase the superiority of its communist system through athletic success. A secret law mandated the use of performance-enhancing drugs in athletes' training. Coaches and doctors implemented a systematic doping program, recruiting young athletes and administering anabolic steroids, notably Oral-Turinabol, often presented as \"vitamins.\" Athletes were required to take these pills and forbidden from discussing them.\n\nWhile some young athletes may have initially believed they were taking vitamins, most eventually realized they were using performance-enhancing drugs. Male athletes experienced increased muscle mass and stamina, while female athletes saw even more pronounced effects.\n\nBetween 1968 and the late 1980s, approximately 9,000 GDR athletes were doped, leading to significant successes in international competitions, especially the Olympics. In the 1968 Olympics, the GDR women's swim team won 11 of 13 gold medals, raising suspicions. The U.S. women's team managed to win only one gold medal, notably in the 4×100-meter relay, where they upset the favored East Germans.\n\nMany GDR athletes were aware of the illegal doping and had misgivings but generally complied with their coaches and doctors. One swimmer recalled:\n\n> \"The training motto at the pool was, 'You eat the pills, or you die.' It was forbidden to refuse.\"\n\nSome athletes resisted. One female swimmer, who gained 45 pounds of muscle, recounted:\n\n> \"I just woke one day and said this feels like sh*t. It’s wrong, it’s cheating, and I feel horrible. When I said no, no more pills, no more needles, the coaches freaked out. They kept trying to convince me to dope, but I refused. Shortly afterward, my performances fell behind my other training partners, so they moved me into the lazy group. I was no longer a member of the GDR elite. There was fighting and arguing and it got ugly, so in 1979, right before [the] Moscow [Olympics], I just quit. Hung up my suit.\n\n> I knew we were on something. Everybody was getting enormous, and we are talking about young women, teenagers, here; so we all knew that we were being doped, but we were forbidden to talk to anyone or to each other. It was like prison. I got called before the Central Committee, the big STASI [the GDR’s secret police force] honchos; they wanted me to take the vitamins and keep swimming; but I told them forget it, it was wrong and dangerous. They thought I was nuts, so they cut me loose. I also believe that some of the young girls loved the way their swim times dropped and their recovery from hard workouts, so they didn’t complain; they rather enjoyed it.\"\n\nBy the late 1980s, Olympic doping authorities began uncovering the GDR's practices. Doctors and coaches, aware of the adverse effects of Oral-Turinabol, continued the doping regimen. Men experienced shrinking genitalia; women developed enlarged clitorises, excessive body hair, deepened voices, and increased aggression. Both genders suffered from severe acne, liver damage, heart disease, various cancers, infertility, and birth defects in offspring.

The epidemic caught world health authorities off guard, ultimately killing thousands and threatening to develop into a worldwide epidemic. A broad range of organizations and politicians, from health care authorities and Doctors Without Borders to the World Health Organization and Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, made dramatic appeals for American military intervention. The legacy of colonial ties affected the perceptions of responsibility for provision of assistance. The United Kingdom took charge of relief efforts in Sierra Leone, France in Guinea, and the United States in Liberia, a state founded in the 19th century by former African-American slaves.\n\nAfter initially receiving criticism for acting too cautiously, President Obama responded by sending over 3,000 military personnel, mostly medics and engineers, to Liberia. It was the largest American intervention ever in a global health crisis. President Obama justified this decision by arguing that the United States had an ethical obligation as a leader of the global community to address the humanitarian crisis in Liberia as well as a security interest in controlling the epidemic in Africa so that it did not spread to the U.S. and other countries. According to President Obama, only the American military had the resources, hierarchical structure, and discipline to carry out such a largescale effort.\n\nObjections to the “militarization” of this relief effort came in several forms. Conservative critics argued that militaries are for fighting and winning wars, not providing humanitarian assistance. Others argued the humanitarian effort could morph into security and military engagement. David Ridenhour, president of the National Center for Public Policy Research, worried that American soldiers could be faced with difficult moral dilemmas, such as “having to shoot unarmed, possibly infected Liberian civilians or allow Ebola to spread.” Some critics were concerned that U.S. military intervention jeopardized the principle of neutrality that health relief organizations try to maintain. Historian Andrew Bacevich argued that a military response to a humanitarian crisis, even if successful, would mask and perpetuate gross misallocation of resources toward building military capacity rather than address global health care needs.\n\nUltimately, the Ebola epidemic was brought under control in Liberia and the rest of Western Africa. The United States military built 11 treatment units and the government expended hundreds of millions of dollars in the relief effort. However, as The New York Times reported, there is limited evidence that these efforts played any significant role. Only 28 Ebola patients were treated in the 11 treatment centers built by the military. The number of new Ebola cases peaked at 635 the week after President Obama announced the military intervention, but dropped to just over 100 by the time the first medical unit was opened.

According to many legal experts and the U.S. government, his actions violated the Espionage Act of 1917, which identified the leak of state secrets as an act of treason. Yet despite the fact that he broke the law, Snowden argued that he had a moral obligation to act. He gave a justification for his “whistleblowing” by stating that he had a duty “to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them.” According to Snowden, the government’s violation of privacy had to be exposed regardless of legality.\n\nMany agreed with Snowden. Jesselyn Radack of the Government Accountability Project defended his actions as ethical, arguing that he acted from a sense of public good. Radack said:\n\n> “Snowden may have violated a secrecy agreement, which is not a loyalty oath but a contract, and a less important one than the social contract a democracy has with its citizenry.”\n\nOthers argued that even if he was legally culpable, he was not ethically culpable because the law itself was unjust and unconstitutional.\n\nThe Attorney General of the United States, Eric Holder, did not find Snowden’s rationale convincing.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nHome DNA testing is a booming business. Millions of Americans have sent their DNA to commercial testing companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry to learn more about their heritage or potential for disease. According to Grand View Research, “the global DNA testing market is set to reach over $10 billion by 2022.” (Brown 2018). Successful marketing campaigns have led consumers to believe that home DNA testing is fun, informative, and personal to them. However, what consumers may not realize is that once their genetic information is shared, they have limited control as to who has access to it.\n\nRegardless of the reason consumers decide to purchase a home DNA test kit, the information they provide to the testing company is far greater than the information they receive. The benefits that these testing companies can gain from gathering, using, and selling customers’ private information places them in a significant conflict-of-interest situation. Some of this information includes the IP address, name, address, email, and family history, collected from the application, as well as information provided on follow up surveys. Furthermore, according to its website, if customers opt to share their data for research, 23andMe could keep their physical spit sample and the genetic data it contains for up to a decade. Additional information that consumers upload to the companies’ genealogy website, such as pictures, obituaries, family relationships, and even third-party information is probably added to the pool of data linked to customers’ DNA.\n\nRecently, some have felt that privacy and consumer rights have been violated when they used home DNA kits. In June 2019, Lori Collett sued Ancestry for allegedly misleading customers about what it was doing with their DNA. This class action lawsuit claims that personal information was released to outside parties without customer consent. Further contentions include that the waiver of consumer rights through consent forms is often vague, general in scope, and ever-changing. The fine print may not accurately spell out what the company, its third-party associates, and collaborators can or will do with customer information. (Merken, 2019)\n\nFurther concerns arise as testing companies often align themselves with pharmaceutical companies, public and private research organizations, and Google. For example, “GlaxoSmithKline purchased a $300 million stake in the company, allowing the pharmaceutical giant to use 23andMe’s trove of genetic data to develop new drugs — and raising new privacy concerns for consumers.” (Ducharme, 2018) Similarly, Ancestry is sharing its data with Google through its research subsidiary Calico. Ancestry admits that “once they share people’s genetic information with partner companies, they can’t be responsible for security protocols of those partners.” (Leavenworth, 2018).\n\nAdditionally, both 23andMe and Ancestry use Google Analytics to provide third parties with consumer information for targeted marketing. In its privacy policy 23andMe states that “when you use our Services, including our website or mobile app(s), our third-party service providers may collect Web-Behavior Information about your visit, such as the links you clicked on, the duration of your visit, and the URLs you visited.” This use of shared information allows testing services and third parties to build a comprehensive personal profile on you, which may include your genetic information.\n\nAlthough privacy may be a concern of consumers, law enforcement with the cooperation of DNA testing companies, either through partnership or warrants, have brought justice to the victims of numerous unsolved cases. Over the past few years, the use of consumer DNA databases have closed many high profile cold cases such as the Golden State Killer and overturned the wrongful conviction of Alfred Swinton. In some cases, such as the Golden State Killer, the DNA used to identify suspects are cross-referenced through the DNA of relatives as far removed as third cousins. However, this has brought additional concerns, as a DNA expert for the American Civil Liberties Union, Vera Eidelman states, “There’s always a danger that things will be used beyond their initial targets, beyond their initial purpose.” (St. John 2019)\n\nThe success of consumer DNA databases has led some law enforcement to meet with Bennett Greenspan, the CEO of FamilyTreeDNA, seeking his help to convince consumers to share their genetic data with police. This partnership has resulted in the creation of the non-profit Institute for DNA Justice that has the following stated mission:\n\n> “The Institute for DNA Justice was formed to educate the public about the value of investigative genetic genealogy (IGG) as a revolutionary new tool to identify, arrest, and convict violent criminals, deter violent crime, exonerate the innocent, encourage the 26 million Americans who have taken a DNA test to become genetic witnesses by participating in publicly available family-matching databases working with law enforcement using IGG, and to promote the adoption of industry leading best practices guidelines surrounding its use by law enforcement agencies around the country.”\n\nRegardless of public or private testing, laws in the United States have not yet determined a standard for the home DNA testing industry."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would inform consumers about the potential risks and privacy concerns associated with home DNA testing kits.

During the investigation, the FBI attempted to access the data stored on the device but was unable to bypass its encryption. The Obama administration's legal team approached Apple for assistance in unlocking the phone; however, negotiations soon reached an impasse. Subsequently, the Justice Department secured a court order compelling Apple to aid the FBI in unlocking the device. Apple's CEO, Timothy Cook, publicly contested the court's directive in an open letter, igniting a vigorous debate over the balance between national security and individual privacy.\n\nApple, along with supporters including major technology companies like Google and Facebook, argued that the court order posed a threat to individual privacy on multiple fronts. Firstly, Apple contended that the order effectively mandated the company to write code, thereby violating its First Amendment right to free speech by compelling it to \"say\" something against its will. Previous legal cases had already established computer code as a form of protected speech. Secondly, Apple expressed concern that creating such a backdoor could potentially fall into the wrong hands, jeopardizing the privacy of all iPhone users. Lastly, Apple warned that complying with the order would set a dangerous precedent, enabling law enforcement to repeatedly require businesses like Apple to assist in criminal investigations, effectively turning technology companies into agents of the government.\n\nOn the other hand, representatives from both sides of the political spectrum presented several arguments in favor of the Justice Department's position and against Apple's stance. Their primary assertion was that the U.S. legal system establishes constraints on the government's access to private information, preventing abuse of search and surveillance powers. Simultaneously, the law permits authorities to access information that facilitates the prevention and prosecution of criminal activities, ranging from terrorism to drug trafficking to child exploitation. Critics of Apple also dismissed the slippery slope argument, asserting that if Apple cooperated, it could safeguard the code it created and prevent it from falling into the hands of malicious actors, including terrorists or criminal organizations.

The flag and the pole on which it was flown were both removed the following day. Leading up to this removal was heated debate concerning whether or not the Confederate flag should be taken down. Similar discussions occurred across the United States in places where Confederate flags or other Confederate symbols were on display, ranging from governmental properties and university campuses to NASCAR venues and popular television series.\n\nPrior to the flag’s official removal from the front of the South Carolina State House, police arrested activist Brittany Newsome for climbing the flagpole and removing the flag herself. The activist explained her act of defiance, stating, “because it was the right thing to do and it was time for somebody to step up. Do the right thing. We have to bury hate; it’s been too long.” South Carolina Representative Jenny Anderson Horne, an ancestor of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis, argued that the Confederate flag should no longer fly in front of the State House. She chastised her colleagues in an emotional speech, stating:\n\n> “I cannot believe that we do not have the heart in this body to do something meaningful—such as take a symbol of hate off these grounds on Friday.”\n\nOn the other hand, Confederate sympathizers contend that the flag is a symbol of historical pride, not of hatred. They claim that efforts to remove the flag are a misplaced reaction to photos of Dylann Roof posing with a Confederate flag. Roof had been recently charged with the racially motivated killing of nine black people in a Charleston church. South Carolina State Senator Lee Bright noted that symbols have been misused throughout history. Bright said, for example, that he believed the Ku Klux Klan abused the symbol of the cross, but there has not been a push to remove all crosses.

These offenses included verbal, emotional, and physical abuse.\n\nAt Yale University, administrators sent an email to students advising them to avoid racially insensitive Halloween costumes, such as those featuring blackface or mock Native American headdresses. Controversy arose when Erika Christakis, a white lecturer of early childhood education and associate master at one of the university’s residential colleges, emailed the students she oversaw, objecting to the call for sensitivity. Christakis questioned what she described as an “institutional… exercise of implied control over college students,” asking, “Is there no room anymore for a child or young person to be a little bit obnoxious… a little bit inappropriate or provocative or, yes, offensive?” In response, many students signed an open letter to Christakis, stating:\n\n> “We are not asking to be coddled… [We] simply ask that our existences not be invalidated on campus. This is us asking for basic respect of our cultures and our livelihoods.”\n\nDuring a protest, a student confronted Christakis’s husband, Nicholas Christakis, a professor at Yale and master of one of the residential colleges. The students told him to step down, asserting that being a master was “not about creating an intellectual space… [but] creating a home here.”\n\nAt the University of Missouri, administrators were criticized for their slow and ineffective responses to ongoing racial tensions on campus. After Payton Head, a Black student and president of the Missouri Student Association, was taunted with racial slurs, it took university chancellor R. Bowen Loftin nearly a week to respond. Following this and other incidents, students organized rallies and demonstrations. Tensions escalated after someone used feces to smear a swastika on a communal bathroom in a residence hall. This act of vandalism became the final straw for graduate student Jonathan Butler, who had led or been involved in many demonstrations up to that point. He decided to go on an indefinite hunger strike until university system president Tim Wolfe was removed from office. In support of Butler, the football team announced they would neither practice nor play until Wolfe resigned. Many students joined in support of the protests. Butler ended his weeklong hunger strike after Wolfe resigned.\n\nAmid the student protests at Missouri, further controversy emerged when protesters tried to keep news media out of the campus public grounds where they had been camping out for days. Student photographer Tim Tai, on assignment for ESPN, was surrounded and confronted by protesters, including university staff members, who did not want any media to enter what they said was a “safe space.” Tai was attempting to document the protests in public spaces, stating:\n\n> “This is the First Amendment that protects your right to stand here and mine. …The law protects both of us.”\n\nA video capturing the confrontation went viral and sparked wider debate over the issue of freedom of speech in the protests at Missouri, Yale, and other college campuses. Journalists, commentators, and academics raised discussions over the roles of free speech, deliberation, and tolerance in the dialogue between student activists and university administrators.\n\nFreelance journalist Terrell Jermaine Starr, in defense of the protesters, wrote:\n\n> “This wasn’t a problem with Tai’s character or his journalistic integrity; he was doing his job… but reporters should also feel a responsibility to try to understand and respect [the protesters’] pain…”\n\nStarr continued:\n\n> “In many communities that historically have been marginalized and unfairly portrayed by the media, there’s good reason people do not trust journalists: They often criminalize black people’s pain and resistance to racial oppression.”\n\nSuzanne Nossel, executive director of PEN American Center, defended free speech as a crucial driver of social justice reform:\n\n> “[Without] free speech, the ‘safe spaces’ students crave will soon suffocate them. Social movements must evolve or they die. Ideological and even tactical evolution demands willingness to hear out heterodoxy. Likewise, free speech defenders will not win by dismissing students as insolent whiners. …The Black Lives Matter movement and the campus protests are efforts to jump-start a drive for racial equality that has stalled in key areas. Free speech is essential to that quest.”\n\nWriting about the Yale incident, journalist Conor Friedersdorf suggested that the student activists’ intolerance of other views could lead to censorship. He wrote, “[Students] were perfectly free to talk about their pain. Some felt entitled to something more, and that is what prolonged the debate.” Op-ed columnist Nicholas Kristof addressed the broader role of freedom of speech on college campuses:\n\n> “The protesters at Mizzou and Yale and elsewhere make a legitimate point: Universities should work harder to make all students feel they are safe and belong. Members of minorities—whether black or transgender or (on many campuses) evangelical conservatives—should be able to feel a part of campus, not feel mocked in their own community.”\n\nPolitical theorist Danielle Allen, on the other hand, described the debate over freedom of speech as a distraction from the key issues of the protests. Allen wrote:\n\n> “The issues of free speech matter, too, but they are leading people in the wrong direction, away from the deepest issue. …The real issue is how to think about social equality.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would first ensure that the safety and well-being of all students involved in the protests are prioritized.

Clinical social workers are the largest professional group providing mental health services in the United States, providing services in urban and rural outpatient and inpatient settings. Social workers are seen as different from clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and other occupational groups that provide therapy in the emphasis that social work places on social justice, cultural competence, and respect for diversity. According to the National Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics, the social work profession requires its members to:\n\n> “[A]ct to prevent and eliminate…discrimination against any person, group, or class on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, color, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, political belief, religion, or mental or physical disability.”\n\nAn ethical dilemma may arise when the religious or moral beliefs of the social worker interfere with the duty of all health care professionals to provide optimal service to clients and to “do no harm.” This issue made national headlines in a related context, when Kim Davis, a clerk in Rowan County, Kentucky, was jailed after defying a federal court order to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. Her action was based on her contention that to do so would violate her religious beliefs. In his ruling, Judge David L. Bunning of the United States District Court stated:\n\n> “If you give people the opportunity to choose which orders they follow, that’s what potentially causes problems.”\n\nIn defense of Davis, Ryan Anderson of the Heritage Foundation wrote:\n\n> “Ms. Davis felt she had to follow her conscience… That, after all, is what religious freedom and religious accommodations are all about: creating the space for citizens to fulfill their duties, as they understand them, to God—regardless of what the rest of us think.”\n\nA similar conflict between religious faith and the requirements of one’s job or one’s profession may be seen in social work practice in the following scenario:\n\nA clinical social worker has been treating a 25-year-old man for depression and anxiety. In the fourth session, the client reveals that he is gay, and that he has not “come out” to his family. He states that he has been involved in a committed, monogamous relationship with another man, and is contemplating marriage. He would like to inform his parents of this good news, but is fearful that they may angrily reject him. He is seeking counseling around this issue. The social worker belongs to a faith tradition that believes that homosexuality is a sin, and whose leaders have been prominent in opposing same-sex marriage.

Funded by taxpayers, grants, and individual donors, the shelter provides refuge for thousands of lost, unwanted, neglected, and abandoned animals annually.\n\nIn recent years, the Lied Animal Shelter faced significant challenges due to overcrowding, attributed to a surge in animal intake as residents in the greater Las Vegas area (Clark County) surrendered or lost their pets. Analysts believed that the 2008 recession was a major contributing factor to pet abandonment. April Corbin, writing for *Las Vegas Weekly*, reported:\n\n> “The Las Vegas Valley has a problem with domestic animals: we have more than we seem able or willing to handle, and those without homes mostly end up at the Lied Shelter. On any given day, it may be the busiest animal holding facility in the nation. …Some blame the recession, which led to the foreclosures of more than 150,000 homes in Clark County between January 2007 and May 2014, triggering the wholesale abandonment of animals.”\n\nIn 2013, the Lied Animal Shelter took in over 40,000 abandoned or lost animals. Of these, more than 10,000 were adopted, nearly 5,000 were reunited with their owners, and over 2,500 were transferred to other facilities. However, 21,000 animals—more than half of those brought to the shelter—were euthanized. Many in Clark County were discouraged by the seemingly insurmountable problems the shelter faced.\n\nLeaders at R&R Partners, a full-service international advertising agency headquartered in Las Vegas, believed their persuasive communication skills could help address the Animal Foundation’s challenges. R&R took on the nonprofit as a pro bono client with goals of promoting pet ownership and driving traffic to the Animal Foundation’s pet adoption website, NewPetNow.com. The agency conducted qualitative research through focus groups with R&R employees who were pet owners. They developed a strategy to frame pet adoption not about love and companionship but about pets’ many household uses (e.g., alarm system, sleeping mask, vacuum cleaner) with a tongue-in-cheek tone. The agency created an integrated communication campaign of “In-FUR-mercial” spoofs that portrayed pets as multi-purpose products for the home. Examples of the “Pet Dog” and “Pet Cat” In-FUR-mercials are available online.\n\nAfter the release of the ads in early 2015, the campaign received critical acclaim from industry analysts. *ADWEEK* contributor Gabriel Beltrone stated, “The writing is sharp and funny, the acting perfectly overdone, and the voiceover as cheesy as possible—dead-on parody.” The In-FUR-mercials also received CynopsisMedia’s award for the Best 30-Second Spot.\n\nThe campaign resonated with audiences in Las Vegas and generated positive press for the Animal Foundation and the Lied Shelter, helping them achieve their goal of increasing pet adoption. The percentage of available pets adopted increased by 9.39 percent during 2015, resulting in more than 1,000 additional animals being adopted.\n\nLeaders at R&R Partners acknowledged that the campaign also brought important benefits to the agency beyond the success and visibility of the campaign. Morale and camaraderie within the agency were enhanced, and the agency’s reputation as a responsible corporate citizen was reinforced. Sarah Catletti, an account supervisor at R&R Partners, described the benefits to the agency:\n\n> “Welcoming the Animal Foundation to R&R Vegas’ list of clients was a great way to boost morale within the agency.

While these incentives were meant to spur more efficient and productive healthcare for veterans, not all administrators complied as intended.\n\nIn one hospital, the goal was to reduce wait times to less than 14 days. Clerks would record a wait time of how many days there would be between the first available appointment date and the veteran’s scheduled appointment date, disregarding any days prior to the first available date.

But you have to know the rules of the game you are playing, and when we exceed the 14-day measure, the front office gets very upset.”\n\nAt some locations, veterans were put on an electronic waiting list. After waiting for up to six weeks to move to the top of that list, they were finally able to call for a doctor’s appointment.

Jewish men, women, and children were murdered near their homes in surrounding fields and forests by German police forces and their local helpers. Historians estimate that these so-called mobile killing units shot almost 2 million people during World War II. After the war, when some of the shooters and their commanders were put on trial, they claimed that they had to follow orders. Decades later, however, historians studying the interrogation files of one of these police battalions made a startling discovery. Not only did many ordinary Germans participate in the mass murder of Jews, they did so voluntarily.\n\nIn his book on one group of reserve policemen from the German city Hamburg, Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland, historian Christopher Browning shows that while the men were expected to follow orders when it came to killing civilians, they could have refused to do so. In July 1942, before their induction into the mass shooting of civilians in the small Polish town of Józefów, their commander gave battalion members a choice. If any of the men were “not up to the task,” they would be assigned to do “other duties,” such as guarding or transportation. When given the opportunity to opt out, only a very small number of men did. Even though this option remained in the months that followed, the majority of reserve policemen chose to kill—to do the “dirty work” even if just for a short time before being relieved of duty—rather than separate themselves from their unit by refusing to murder civilians.\n\nMost of these ordinary, middle-aged German men became willing, although not enthusiastic, killers. A small minority consistently excused themselves from the task at hand. Browning argues that those who killed, did so because of:\n\n“[T]he pressure for conformity—the basic identification of men in uniform with their comrades and the strong urge not to separate themselves from the group by stepping out… [The] act of stepping out…meant leaving one’s comrades and admitting that one was ‘too weak’ or ‘cowardly’.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this scenario, I would focus on the importance of individual agency and moral responsibility.

It features high-speed collisions between human beings, at least one of whom is often very large. Broken bones, torn ligaments, and even occasional paralysis can result. But it is the research on brain injuries that has caused many people to claim football is immoral and to advocate that it be banned. Such calls have gained the attention and opposition of the National Football League (NFL) given the high popularity and profitability of football as a spectator sport.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as “a disruption in the normal function of the brain that can be caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head, or penetrating head injury.” A concussion is a form of TBI where the blow causes the brain to move rapidly back and forth, bouncing around in the skull and suffering various types of structural damage. Although concussions can carry serious consequences, they are termed a “mild” form of TBI because they are not typically life-threatening. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), says the Mayo Clinic, is “brain degeneration likely caused by repeated head traumas.” Repetitive head impacts (RHIs) can cumulatively lead to CTE and early death, even though no single RHI results in a concussion.\n\nIf only one thing is clear about the current science surrounding sports-related concussions (SRCs) and their related brain injuries, it’s that very little is certain about the current science. The field is surprisingly new. A significant scientific breakthrough occurred in 2002 when an African-American neuropathologist in Pittsburgh named Bennet Omalu (played by Will Smith in the 2015 movie Concussion) performed an autopsy on Hall of Fame center Mike Webster. Dr. Omalu identified abnormal clumps of the protein tau in Webster’s brain, which he believed to be evidence of CTE. Such proteins develop in tangles that slowly strangle neurons and, consequently, inhibit brain function.\n\nMany studies point to how dangerous football is to players’ long-term brain health. Although there is also research related to college players and younger, this case study focuses on the NFL. The studies show:\n\n- Over two regular seasons (2012-2014), NFL players sustained 4,384 injuries, including 301 concussions. This statistic is up 61% from 2002-2007, perhaps reflecting an improvement of awareness and reporting (Lawrence et al. 2015).\n\n- In a study of 14,000 NFL players, researchers found that even head impacts insufficient to cause concussions can mount up over the years, leading to CTE and premature death. An NFL player who plays 24 games increases the likelihood of premature death by 16% (Ehrlich et al., 2019).\n\n- A 2019 study of the brains of 223 football players with CTE and 43 players without CTE found that for each additional 2.6 years of play, the risk of developing CTE doubled (Mex et al. 2019).\n\nGiven the results of these studies, there has been a strong outcry against football, including at the NFL level. The NFL initially pushed back against the implications of such research. Then, as evidence piled up, the NFL funded research itself about head injuries and also how to design safer equipment. And, the NFL made rule changes in an attempt to make the game safer. The NFL has also changed rules to discourage helmet-to-helmet contact, and instituted protocols for safely returning concussed players to the field.\n\nDespite these changes, controversy continues because the science in this area is not settled. Importantly, standard medical imaging techniques do not show brain damage even when a player has had a concussion. And CTE cannot truly be diagnosed until the brain is examined after death.\n\nNeuropsychologist Munro Cullum argues: “I worry the pendulum has swung too far. The reality is that we still don’t know who is most likely to suffer a concussion, who will take longer to recover, how anatomic or genetic differences influence concussions, and who may be at risk of prolonged symptoms or developing cognitive problems later in life.”\n\nSome studies seem to indicate that concussions may be more benign than feared. For example:\n\n- A 2016 study found no elevated risk of suicide in a population of players with at least five years in the league (Lehman et al., 2016).\n\n- Another study of 35 former NFL players over age 50 who had sustained multiple concussions during their careers found no significant association between the length of careers, the number of concussions, and their level of cognitive function later in life (Mez et al., 2019).\n\n- A 2007 study found that retired NFL players experienced levels of depressive symptoms no worse than those of the general population (Schwenk, 2007).\n\nSo, at the end of the day, the jury still seems to be out on the question of whether or not we can go to a football game or watch one on television and still feel good about ourselves for supporting a sport that arguably causes irreversible traumatic brain injuries."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would recommend conducting further research and studies to better understand the long-term effects of playing football on brain health.

These researchers concluded “either the vaccine failed to protect the elderly against mortality… and/or the vaccination efforts did not adequately target the frailest elderly.”\n\nMore recent research has tried to develop a method to assess in advance whether a given flu vaccine would have any protection benefit. A report published in 2016 in the journal Nature Immunology used a blood assay and identified a correlation between persons with a certain pattern of gene expression and the likelihood that such persons would experience adverse events after receiving a flu vaccine. If this assay could be made economical, and included in blood tests typically done in annual physicals, it could reduce the number of suits filed with the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. With these reports in mind, consider the following case:\n\nDr. Jones works in a hospital and she recently became aware of all the above reports. She belongs to the American Medical Association (AMA), which strongly recommends that everyone receive flu shots each year. Moreover, her hospital recently informed her that she herself must take annual flu shots or risk termination of her hospital privileges or employment. Dr. Jones, however, is aware of the AMA Code of Ethics, which states that patients have a right of self-decision regarding their health care, and that this right can only be effectively exercised “if the patient possesses enough information to enable an informed choice.” She feels a moral obligation to inform her senior patients that she has reservations about the efficacy of flu shots for their age group and why.\n\nSince the AMA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are strong proponents of annual flu shots, if Dr. Jones gives contrary advice to her patients, this could jeopardize her standing with the AMA, in addition to her employment at her hospital. Furthermore, her hospital administrator and other health officials are concerned that if doctors advise patients about the relative ineffectiveness of, and potential injury from, flu vaccines, this could feed public doubts about the efficacy or safety of other vaccines. Such doubts could increase public opposition to new state laws that aim to promote “herd immunity” by mandating certain vaccinations.\n\nWhile the case of Dr. Jones is based on the actual experiences of a medical doctor, her name and identifying details have been changed. This case study reflects the key ethical dilemmas the doctor faced."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would advise Dr. Jones to carefully consider the potential consequences of her actions before deciding how to proceed. She could start by reviewing the specific research studies mentioned in the scenario to better understand the evidence behind the effectiveness of flu shots, especially for the elderly population. Dr. Jones could also consult with colleagues or mentors within the medical community to get their perspectives on the situation.\n\nIf Dr. Jones decides to inform her senior patients about her reservations regarding the efficacy of flu shots for their age group, she should do so in a respectful and non-confrontational manner. She could consider presenting the information as part of a broader discussion about preventive health measures and the importance of informed decision-making in healthcare. Dr. Jones should be prepared to answer any questions her patients may have and provide them with resources for further reading or research.\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Jones may want to document her concerns and the reasons behind her decision to share this information with her patients. Keeping a record of her actions and the rationale behind them could help protect her in case of any potential backlash from the hospital administration or professional organizations.\n\nUltimately, Dr. Jones should prioritize the well-being and autonomy of her patients while also being mindful of the potential professional and personal consequences of her actions. It is important for her to act in a way that aligns with her ethical beliefs and values, while also considering the broader implications of her choices within the medical community."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is the answer ethical?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer provided is practical and specific in advising Dr. Jones to carefully consider the consequences of her actions before informing her senior patients about her reservations regarding flu shots.

Under NCLB, every child in the U.S. must achieve proficiency in reading and math. While each state can determine its own level of proficiency, a child’s ability to advance to the next grade level, and even graduate from high school, hinges on passing a standardized test. Across the U.S., children in minority communities have been more likely not to receive a diploma due to low-test scores on mandated exams.\n\nAssessment has many benefits. Advocates of large-scale assessments claim that it is an objective and fair measure of student achievement. Results show how students, or groups of students, measure up against one another and broader standards. Ideally, all children throughout the country will receive an equal education, and testing can help educators target where instructional improvements are necessary. Sonja Brookins Santelises, Vice President of K-12 Policy and Practice for the Education Trust, acknowledges that there is too much rote test preparation, but argues that we must work together to reduce the achievement gap among student populations. The founder of nonprofit organization StudentsFirst and former Chancellor of D.C. Public Schools, Michelle Rhee, also sees standardized testing as a means to reduce this gap. She states:\n\n> “It’s not inconceivable for a student to be receiving all A’s and B’s on her report card but still be stuck far behind her peers in other districts and states across the country. And without standardized testing, that child’s parents, teachers and principal would have no idea.”\n\nOpponents, however, firmly believe that high stakes testing is problematic and even ruinous to our educational system. There is no research to corroborate that standardized testing, a multi-billion dollar industry controlled by three large U.S. corporations, is effective. Teachers complain that they are forced to “teach to the test,” leaving little or no time for subjects that are not tested, such as art, social studies, and science. Parent and former teacher Edy Chamness founded a Facebook group in 2011 to rally parents in her community to protest against school accountability and standardized testing requirements. She also kept her son out of school on testing days. Other parents, including Maeve Siano of Celina, Texas, similarly felt that the preparation and stress associated with testing were more likely to damage her son than help him. Celina Superintendent Donny O’Dell stated:\n\n> “Our country was basically founded on rebellion, so to speak.

Military analyst Daniel Ellsberg leaked the “Pentagon Papers,” which contained sensitive information regarding the United States’ progress in the Vietnam War. President Nixon himself tasked Krogh with stopping leaks of top-secret information. And Nixon’s Assistant for Domestic Affairs, John Ehrlichman, instructed Krogh to investigate and discredit Ellsberg, telling Krogh that the leak was damaging to national security.\n\nKrogh and another staffer assembled a covert team that became known as the “plumbers” (to stop leaks), which was broadly supervised by Ehrlichman. In September 1971, the plumbers’ first break-in was at the office of Ellsberg’s psychiatrist; they were looking for documents that would discredit Ellsberg based on mental health. Reflecting on the meeting in which the break-in was proposed and approved, Krogh later wrote:\n\n“I listened intently. At no time did I or anyone else there question whether the operation was necessary, legal or moral. Convinced that we were responding legitimately to a national security crisis, we focused instead on the operational details: who would do what, when and where.”\n\nThe break-in, which was illegal, was also unproductive. Nothing was found to discredit Ellsberg. Importantly, the ties between this break-in and Nixon were much more direct and easy to establish than the ties between Nixon and the Watergate break-in. Krogh later pled guilty to his role in the break-in and was sentenced to two-to-six years in prison. At his sentencing, Krogh explained that national security is “subject to a wide range of definitions, a factor that makes all the more essential a painstaking approach to the definition of national security in any given instance.” Judge Gesell, sentencing Krogh to serve six months in prison and remain on unsupervised probation for another two years, said:\n\n“In acknowledging your guilt, you have made no effort, as you very well might have, to place the primary blame on others who initiated and who approved the undertaking. A wholly improper, illegal task was assigned to you by higher authority and you carried it out because of a combination of loyalty and I believe a degree of vanity, thereby compromising your obligations as a lawyer and a public servant.”\n\nKrogh, who cooperated with the Watergate prosecutors and never bargained for leniency, served only four-and-a-half months of his sentence. The Washington State Supreme Court disbarred Krogh in 1975, although he successfully petitioned to be reinstated in 1980 and became partner in the Seattle law firm Krogh & Leonard. Krogh has spent much of the past 45 years supporting legal ethics education and writing and lecturing on the topic of integrity.

Political commentator and talk show host Rush Limbaugh has become well known for his outspoken opinions on a number of political and social issues, including drug abuse.\n\nDuring his talk show on October 5, 1995, Limbaugh stated:\n\n“There’s nothing good about drug use. We know it. It destroys individuals. It destroys families. Drug use destroys societies. Drug use, some might say, is destroying this country.

Nelson and Robinson were entrepreneurs and were going to discuss business investment opportunities with Yaffe, a white real estate developer. As they waited, an employee asked if she could help them. They said “no,” that they were just waiting for a business meeting. Then a manager told Nelson that he couldn’t use the restroom because he was not a paying customer.\n\nBecause the two men had not purchased anything yet, a store manager called police, even though Robinson had been a customer at the store for almost a decade and both men had used the store location for business meetings before. At least six Philadelphia Police Department officers arrived. The police officers did not ask the men any questions; they just demanded that they leave immediately. They declined. The police officers then proceeded to arrest the men for trespassing. As the arrest occurred, Mr. Yaffe arrived. Seeing what was happening, Yaffe said:\n\n“Why would they be asked to leave? Does anyone else think this is ridiculous? It’s absolute discrimination.”\n\nThe two men were taken out in handcuffs. They were taken to the police station, photographed, and fingerprinted. They were held for almost nine hours before being released from custody.

In the musical, Kim is forced to work at ‘Dreamland,’ a seedy bar owned by the half-French, half-Vietnamese character ‘the Engineer.’ The production was highly anticipated, generating millions of dollars in ticket sales before it had even opened.\n\nControversy erupted and debate ensued about ethical representation in the performing arts, however, when producers revealed that Jonathan Pryce, a white British actor, would reprise his role as the Eurasian ‘Engineer.’ Asian American actor B.D. Wong argued that by casting a white actor in a role written for an Asian actor, the production supported the practice of “yellow-face.” Similar to “blackface” minstrel shows of the 19th and 20th centuries, “yellow-face” productions cast non-Asians in roles written for Asians, often relying on physical and cultural stereotypes to make broad comments about identity. Wong asked his union, Actors’ Equity Association, to “force Cameron Mackintosh and future producers to cast their productions with racial authenticity.”\n\nActors’ Equity Association initially agreed and refused to let Pryce perform:\n\n“Equity believes the casting of Mr. Pryce as a Eurasian to be especially insensitive and an affront to the Asian community.”\n\nMoreover, many argued that the casting of Pryce further limited already scarce professional opportunities for Asian American actors.

The lack of regulation and oversight has led to exploitative labor practices and environmental degradation.\n\nFor paleontologists and collectors, acquiring these amber fossils presents a moral quandary. While the specimens offer unparalleled scientific value, purchasing them may inadvertently support conflict and exploitation. Some scientists argue that studying these fossils is essential for advancing knowledge, while others advocate for a boycott to avoid contributing to the ongoing strife.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by the international demand for amber fossils, which drives up prices and incentivizes continued mining under unethical conditions. Efforts to establish ethical sourcing guidelines and promote responsible practices have been proposed, but enforcement remains challenging in a region with limited governance and oversight.\n\nIn summary, the discovery of Myanmar's amber fossils has opened new windows into the ancient past but has also highlighted the complex interplay between scientific pursuit and ethical responsibility.

In 1994, Lederman asked Gellene to represent mining equipment company Bucyrus-Erie (BE) in a reorganization bankruptcy that became increasingly complicated.\n\nIn an attempt to initially ward off bankruptcy, BE had, pursuant to the legal advice of Milbank Tweed and the financial advice of Goldman Sachs, accepted a $35 million infusion of cash from an investment fund called South Street. In exchange, BE gave South Street a lien on all of the company’s manufacturing equipment, putting it ahead of other BE creditors, including Jackson National Life (JNL). JNL was BE’s largest single creditor, but was unsecured. BE had posted no collateral in return for JNL’s loan, so JNL was in line in bankruptcy court behind all of BE’s creditors that had demanded collateral. South Street was controlled by Mikael Salovaara, a former Goldman Sachs banker who had previously provided financial advice to BE and was advised by Lederman.\n\nWhen Gellene filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on behalf of BE, he was required to ask the court to appoint him and Milbank Tweed as BE’s counsel for purposes of the proceedings. At that time, he filed documents under oath that were supposed to disclose any potential conflicts of interest that Milbank Tweed had in the proceedings. For reasons unknown, Gellene did not disclose to the bankruptcy judge (who would appoint counsel) the fact that Milbank Tweed was representing both South Street and Salovaara regarding various matters.\n\nLegal scholars and attorneys reflecting on this case years later have speculated as to why Gellene did not disclose what might seem to be obvious connections that could be potential conflicts of interest for Milbank Tweed. Lawyer Steve Sather suggests that the lack of disclosure may have been inadvertent, or that Gellene did not see the connections as inherent conflicts, among other possible reasons.\n\nRegardless, Gellene did successfully guide BE through the reorganization process. The failure to disclose was not discovered until years later by JNL, which then sued Milbank Tweed. Criminal charges were filed against Gellene for three felony counts of making false statements under oath in regard to Milbank Tweed’s ability to serve as bankruptcy counsel. Gellene was convicted and sent to prison for 15 months."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If I were in this situation, I would ensure full transparency and disclosure of all potential conflicts of interest to the bankruptcy judge when filing the Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on behalf of BE.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nOn May 10, 2012, executive Ellen Pao filed a lawsuit against her employer, Silicon Valley-based tech venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (Kleiner Perkins), on grounds of gender discrimination. Pao began working at Kleiner Perkins in 2005. She became a junior investing partner, but after several years at the firm was passed over for a senior partner position and was eventually terminated. Pao claimed that men with similar profiles and achievements were promoted instead.\n\nIn late 2011, Pao and a coworker were asked by a senior partner to come up with ways of improving the firm’s treatment of women, but the senior partner, according to Pao, was “noncommittal.” On January 4, 2012, Pao took this issue a step further and wrote a formal memorandum to several of her superiors and the firm’s outside counsel. In the memorandum, she described harassment she had received while at the firm, claiming she had been excluded from meetings by male partners, and asserting an absence of training and policies to prevent discrimination at the firm. Pao’s memo indicated that she wished to work with the firm on improving conditions for women. She was fired on October 1, 2012. The lawsuit went to trial in February 2015.\n\nIn a testimony during the trial, Pao explained that she sued because there was no process for HR issues at the firm and believed she had exhausted all options for addressing these issues internally:\n\n> “It’s been a long journey, and I’ve tried many times to bring Kleiner Perkins to the right path. I think there should be equal opportunities for women and men to be venture capitalists. I wanted to be a VC but I wasn’t able to do so in that environment. And I think it’s important…to make those opportunities available in the future. And I wanted to make sure my story was told.”\n\nPao’s lawsuit made four claims against Kleiner Perkins:\n\n1. They discriminated against Pao on the basis of gender by failing to promote her and/or terminating her employment.\n\n2. They retaliated by failing to promote her because of conversations she had in late 2011 and/or the memo from January 4, 2012.\n\n3. They failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent gender discrimination against her.\n\n4. They retaliated against her by terminating her employment because of conversations she had in late 2011 and/or the memo from January 4, 2012.\n\nPao’s legal team argued that men were promoted ahead of women, women who experienced sexual harassment received little support, and women’s ideas were often more quickly dismissed than men’s. Pao’s performance reviews revealed contradictory criticisms such as “too bold” and “too quiet.” Pao also accused company partner Ajit Nazre of pressuring her into an affair and subsequently retaliating against her after she ended the relationship. She said she received an inappropriate gift containing erotic imagery and was present while men at the firm were making inappropriate conversation. Further, the legal team described how Pao and other women had been left out of certain meetings and gatherings.\n\nThe defense’s case focused on Pao’s performance and character, noting that Pao received several negative performance reviews and acted entitled or resentful toward other employees and was not a team player. Evidence included evaluations, self-evaluations, meeting summaries, and messages both personal and professional. Kleiner Perkins claimed that Pao was paid more than her male counterparts, including bonuses and training. The firm also argued that Pao’s job description was mostly managerial and that limiting her involvement in investing was therefore not a form of discrimination.\n\nThe verdict was announced on March 27, 2015. The jury ruled 10 to 2 in favor of Kleiner Perkins on the first three claims, and 8 to 4 in favor of Kleiner Perkins on the fourth claim. Speaking after the trial, juror Steve Sammut said that the verdict came down to performance reviews, in which Pao’s negative criticism remained consistent each year. But he added that he wished there was some way for Kleiner Perkins to be punished for its treatment of employees, “It isn’t good. It’s like the wild, wild West.” Juror Marshalette Ramsey voted in favor of Pao, believing Pao had been discriminated against. Ramsey stated that the male junior partners who were promoted “had those same character flaws that Ellen was cited with.”\n\nDeborah Rhode, law professor at Stanford University, said that even with this loss, Pao’s lawsuit succeeded in prompting debate about women in venture capital and tech. She stated, “This case sends a powerful signal to Silicon Valley in general and the venture capital industry in particular… Defendants who win in court sometimes lose in the world outside it.” After the verdict was announced, Pao stated that she hoped the case at least helped level the playing field for women and minorities in venture capital. She later wrote:\n\n> “I have a request for all companies: Please don’t try to silence employees who raise discrimination and harassment concerns. …I hope future cases prove me wrong and show that our community and our jurists have now developed a better understanding of how discrimination works in real life, in the tech world, in the press and in the courts.”\n\nPao’s case has since been credited for inspiring others facing workplace discrimination to act; similar lawsuits have been filed against companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Given the scenario, I would review the evidence presented during the trial, including performance reviews, evaluations, meeting summaries, and messages, to understand the basis for the jury's decision.

Following resignation, many Americans were angry with Nixon and also suspicious of Gerald Ford as he stepped into the presidential role. Nixon soon became extremely ill. On August 15, 1974, he was admitted to Bethesda Naval Hospital and diagnosed with viral pneumonia. One account suggests he was admitted with a recurrence of phlebitis. Nixon had a history of phlebitis, which can be fatal even if treated.\n\nOn September 8, 1974, President Ford issued a full and absolute pardon of Nixon for all offenses against the United States, making Nixon immune from any arrest, investigation, or imprisonment from his involvement in Watergate. The pardon infuriated many Americans. Suspicions arose of a possible deal between Ford and Nixon in exchange for Ford’s prior nomination to vice president. All parties denied any such deal and no evidence in support of these allegations ever surfaced.\n\nWith the Watergate scandal consuming the nation, Ford signaled that he wanted to refocus the public and rebuild trust in the executive branch. He sought to move forward by concentrating on the nation’s problems, such as ending the Vietnam War, rather than spending his entire administration dissecting the activities of the previous president for years to come. However, as a result of the pardon, Nixon would never be held accountable for activity widely thought to be criminal.\n\nPresident Ford also believed from reports and advisors that Nixon’s health was seriously compromised and that his death was likely imminent. In his speech announcing the pardon, Ford referred both to the health crisis of Nixon as well as his own personal constitutional duty to ensure domestic tranquility. At the time, it was impossible for Ford to realize that Nixon would eventually recover and live for twenty more years. Ford believed he acted in the nation’s best interests.
