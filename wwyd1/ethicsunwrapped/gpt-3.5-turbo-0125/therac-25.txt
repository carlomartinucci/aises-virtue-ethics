I would immediately contact the FDA and other relevant regulatory authorities to report the incidents involving the Therac-25 machines. I would provide detailed information about the accidents, the inadequate repairs, and the potential risks to patient safety. Additionally, I would recommend conducting a comprehensive investigation into the software design, testing procedures, and safety features of the machines to identify the root causes of the issues. I would also suggest implementing regular audits and monitoring of the machines to ensure ongoing compliance with safety standards and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
