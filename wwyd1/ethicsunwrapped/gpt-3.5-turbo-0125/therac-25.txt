I would immediately convene a multidisciplinary team consisting of engineers, software developers, medical professionals, and regulatory experts to conduct a comprehensive review of the Therac-25 machines. This team would analyze the software design, testing procedures, and safety features to identify any deficiencies that may have contributed to the incidents of radiation overdoses. 

Additionally, I would collaborate with the FDA and other regulatory authorities to ensure that all necessary information is shared transparently and that appropriate actions are taken to address the identified issues. This collaboration would involve providing detailed reports on the incidents, sharing findings from the internal review, and working together to implement stricter reporting requirements for radiation equipment to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Furthermore, I would establish a system for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the safety features and software updates implemented in the Therac-25 machines to verify their effectiveness in enhancing patient safety. This system would involve regular audits, feedback mechanisms from healthcare professionals using the machines, and continuous improvement efforts to address any emerging risks or issues.

By taking these specific actions, we can ensure a thorough investigation, collaboration with regulatory authorities, and ongoing monitoring to promote patient safety, transparency, and accountability in the use of the Therac-25 machines.
