I would collaborate with medical professionals specializing in genetic disorders, including Down syndrome, to conduct a comprehensive study on the impact of prenatal testing bans on abortion. This study would involve collecting data on the outcomes of pregnancies where prenatal testing revealed genetic abnormalities, including Down syndrome, and analyzing the decisions made by individuals and families in such situations. Additionally, I would engage with advocacy groups representing individuals with Down syndrome to ensure their perspectives are included in the research process.

Furthermore, I would convene a panel of experts from diverse backgrounds, including ethicists, legal scholars, and representatives from pro-life and pro-choice organizations, to discuss the ethical implications of prenatal testing bans on abortion. This panel would aim to provide a balanced and informed perspective on the issue, considering the rights and well-being of both the unborn fetus and the pregnant individual.

Based on the findings of the study and the recommendations of the expert panel, I would work towards developing evidence-based policies that strike a balance between protecting the rights of individuals with disabilities, such as Down syndrome, and respecting the autonomy and decision-making of pregnant individuals. These policies would aim to promote informed decision-making, support individuals and families affected by genetic disorders, and uphold ethical principles of justice and compassion in the context of abortion and prenatal testing.
