In addition to reporting Enron's unethical practices to regulatory authorities and cooperating with investigations, I would personally refuse to participate in any fraudulent activities or schemes within the company. I would make it clear to my colleagues that I do not condone such behavior and encourage them to uphold ethical standards in all aspects of their work. By setting a positive example and promoting a culture of integrity within the organization, I aim to prevent future instances of misconduct and prioritize ethical decision-making at all levels.
