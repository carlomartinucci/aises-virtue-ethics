I would immediately report Enron's fraudulent activities to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). I would provide detailed information about the schemes Enron used to manipulate electricity markets in California, including submitting false demand schedules, creating imaginary transmission schedules, and selling services they did not have. I would also encourage other employees who are aware of these practices to come forward and report them as well. By taking these steps, I aim to ensure that Enron is held accountable for its actions and that justice is served for those affected by their fraudulent practices.
