I would conduct a detailed analysis of the revenue-sharing models of digital music platforms such as iTunes, Pandora, and Apple Music to understand how artists are compensated for their work. This analysis would involve examining the percentage of revenue allocated to artists, the terms of agreements, and any additional compensation mechanisms in place. Based on this research, I would identify areas where improvements can be made to ensure fair and equitable compensation for artists.

Additionally, I would engage with artists, industry stakeholders, and consumers to gather diverse perspectives on the issue of artist compensation in the digital music industry. By understanding the concerns and priorities of different stakeholders, I can develop recommendations that take into account the interests of all parties involved.

One specific action I would take is to propose the implementation of transparent and standardized revenue-sharing agreements between digital music platforms and artists. These agreements would clearly outline the percentage of revenue allocated to artists, the terms of payment, and any additional royalties or compensation structures. By establishing transparent agreements, artists can have more visibility and control over their earnings, leading to a fairer distribution of revenue in the industry.
