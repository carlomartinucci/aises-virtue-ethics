I would initiate a comprehensive environmental impact assessment of the proposed offshore drilling expansion in Alaska's northwest coast. This assessment would involve detailed studies on the potential risks to the local ecosystem, particularly focusing on endangered species such as polar bears, walruses, seals, and whales. Additionally, I would engage with environmental experts, indigenous communities, and other stakeholders to gather diverse perspectives on the environmental and social impacts of the drilling project.

Furthermore, I would prioritize transparency in the decision-making process by ensuring that the findings of the environmental impact assessment are made publicly available. This would involve holding public consultations to allow for community input and feedback on the proposed offshore drilling expansion. 

In terms of practical measures, I would work with oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell, to develop and implement robust oil spill response plans specific to the Arctic environment. This would include conducting training exercises and simulations to test the effectiveness of response strategies in icy waters.

Overall, my approach would be to balance economic considerations with environmental protection by conducting a thorough environmental impact assessment, engaging with stakeholders, ensuring transparency in decision-making, and implementing practical measures to mitigate risks associated with offshore drilling in the Arctic.
