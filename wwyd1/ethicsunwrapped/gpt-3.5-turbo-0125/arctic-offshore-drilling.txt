I would establish a transparent and inclusive decision-making process by convening a multi-stakeholder advisory committee consisting of environmental experts, indigenous representatives, industry professionals, and community members. This committee would be tasked with overseeing and evaluating the environmental impact assessment of the proposed offshore drilling expansion in Alaska's northwest coast. 

To address concerns about the potential risks to the local ecosystem and endangered species, I would ensure that the environmental impact assessment includes comprehensive studies on the Arctic wildlife population and their habitats. This assessment would also evaluate the effectiveness of oil spill response plans and the capacity of oil companies to mitigate environmental damage in the event of a spill.

Furthermore, I would prioritize community engagement by organizing public hearings and consultations to gather input from local residents, environmental organizations, and other stakeholders. This participatory approach would allow for a more inclusive decision-making process and ensure that the concerns and perspectives of all relevant parties are taken into consideration.

In addition, I would work towards developing a comprehensive risk management plan that includes specific measures to protect endangered species, minimize environmental impact, and ensure the safety of Arctic ecosystems. This plan would outline concrete strategies for monitoring and addressing potential environmental risks associated with offshore drilling activities.

By implementing these actions, I aim to promote transparency, accountability, and stakeholder engagement in the decision-making process regarding the offshore drilling expansion in the Arctic.
