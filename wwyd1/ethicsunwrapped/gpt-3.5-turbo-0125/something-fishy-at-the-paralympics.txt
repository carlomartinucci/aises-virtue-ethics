To address cheating in the Paralympics and uphold the integrity of the games, I would propose the following concrete actions:

1. Implement Random Classification Checks: Work with the IPC to introduce a system of random classification checks where athletes may be assessed outside of scheduled competitions. This would help deter athletes from misrepresenting their disabilities and ensure fair classification.

By introducing surprise checks, we can increase the likelihood of detecting any discrepancies between an athlete's actual abilities and their classification. This would act as a deterrent to those considering cheating the system and help maintain the integrity of Paralympic competition.

This specific action of random classification checks directly addresses the need for more detailed implementation strategies and practical steps to prevent cheating in the Paralympics.
