In response to the scenario, one specific action that can be taken to resist peer pressure and make an ethical choice is to establish a support network within the group. By forming alliances with like-minded colleagues who share similar ethical values, individuals can create a safe space to discuss concerns and collectively navigate challenging situations. This support network can provide encouragement, validation, and solidarity, making it easier for individuals to resist conformity and make principled decisions. Additionally, by fostering open communication and mutual accountability within the group, members can hold each other to higher ethical standards and collectively uphold moral integrity in their actions.
