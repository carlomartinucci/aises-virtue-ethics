I would establish an independent ethics review board comprising experts in bioethics, law, and medical ethics to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the research conducted at Heidelberg University and Wayne State University using human cadavers in car crash tests. This board would review the research protocols, consent procedures, and the necessity of using human cadavers over alternative methods. The board would also assess the impact of the research on car safety advancements and consider the long-term ethical implications of such practices. Based on the board's findings, I would recommend specific guidelines and regulations to ensure transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct in future research involving human cadavers in car crash tests.
