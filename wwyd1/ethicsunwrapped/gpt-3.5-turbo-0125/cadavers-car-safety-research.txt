I would initiate a comprehensive review of the research practices at Heidelberg University and Wayne State University regarding the use of human cadavers in car crash tests. This review would involve examining the process of obtaining cadavers, ensuring that proper consent was obtained from the families, and evaluating the necessity of using human cadavers over alternative methods such as advanced crash test dummies. Additionally, I would assess the transparency of the research process and the communication of findings to the public. Based on this review, I would recommend implementing strict ethical guidelines for future research involving human subjects, prioritizing respect for human dignity, informed consent, and the pursuit of knowledge that cannot be obtained through other means.
