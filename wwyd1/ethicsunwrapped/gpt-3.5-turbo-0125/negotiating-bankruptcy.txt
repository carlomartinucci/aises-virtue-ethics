If faced with the scenario described, I would take immediate action to rectify the lack of disclosure regarding the potential conflicts of interest involving Milbank Tweed, South Street, and Salovaara. Specifically, I would promptly disclose these connections to the bankruptcy judge overseeing the proceedings. This disclosure would involve providing a detailed explanation of the relationships between the parties and acknowledging the oversight in the initial filing.

Furthermore, I would proactively seek guidance from the firm's ethics committee or a legal ethics expert to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to address the issue appropriately. This may involve revisiting the initial filing documents, amending them to include the required disclosures, and communicating openly and transparently with all relevant parties involved in the bankruptcy proceedings.

By taking these concrete actions, I would demonstrate a commitment to upholding ethical standards, maintaining transparency, and addressing any potential conflicts of interest in a responsible and proactive manner.
