If faced with the scenario described, I would take immediate action to rectify the lack of disclosure regarding the connections between Milbank Tweed, South Street, and Salovaara. Specifically, I would promptly inform the bankruptcy judge about the oversight and provide a detailed explanation of the relationships between the parties involved. This proactive approach would demonstrate transparency and integrity in addressing the potential conflict of interest.

Additionally, I would consult with the firm's ethics committee or a legal ethics expert to seek guidance on how to best handle the situation moving forward. By involving relevant stakeholders and seeking expert advice, I would ensure that all necessary steps are taken to comply with professional standards and uphold the integrity of the legal process.

Overall, by promptly disclosing the oversight to the bankruptcy judge, seeking guidance from ethics experts, and taking proactive measures to address the conflict of interest, I would strive to rectify the situation in an ethical and responsible manner.
