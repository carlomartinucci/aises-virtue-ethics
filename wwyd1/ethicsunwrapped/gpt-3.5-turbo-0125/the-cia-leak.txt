I would recommend implementing stricter protocols and training within government agencies, particularly those handling sensitive information like the CIA, to prevent future breaches of classified identities. This could involve mandatory briefings on the importance of maintaining confidentiality, regular reviews of security procedures, and enhanced oversight to ensure compliance with regulations. Additionally, establishing clear consequences for individuals found guilty of leaking classified information, such as immediate termination and legal action, would serve as a deterrent and reinforce the seriousness of such actions. By prioritizing accountability and security measures, we can work towards safeguarding national security and protecting the identities of covert operatives.
