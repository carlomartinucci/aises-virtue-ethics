I would recommend advocating for the implementation of stricter regulations within government agencies to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of classified information. Specifically, I would propose the establishment of mandatory training programs for all government officials and employees handling sensitive information, emphasizing the importance of maintaining confidentiality and adhering to security protocols. Additionally, I would suggest the creation of a centralized oversight body responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with these regulations, conducting regular audits to ensure accountability and prevent future leaks. By taking proactive measures to strengthen security measures and promote a culture of responsibility and integrity, we can mitigate the risks posed by unauthorized disclosures and safeguard national security interests.
