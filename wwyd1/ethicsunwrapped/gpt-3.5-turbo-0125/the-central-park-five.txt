I would work on implementing policy changes within the criminal justice system to prevent coerced confessions and ensure fair trials for all individuals. Specifically, I would advocate for the mandatory recording of all interrogations to provide transparency and accountability in the process. This would help prevent false confessions and protect the rights of individuals during police questioning. Additionally, I would support the training of law enforcement officers on proper interrogation techniques and the recognition of coercion indicators to prevent wrongful convictions. By focusing on these concrete actions, we can work towards a more just and equitable criminal justice system that upholds the rights of all individuals.
