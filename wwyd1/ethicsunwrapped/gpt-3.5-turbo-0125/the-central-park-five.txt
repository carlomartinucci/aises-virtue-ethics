I would collaborate with legal advocacy organizations to push for policy changes that address the issues highlighted in the Central Park 5 case. Specifically, I would work towards implementing mandatory recording of all police interrogations to prevent coercion and false confessions. Additionally, I would support initiatives that provide comprehensive training for law enforcement on conducting fair investigations and handling evidence properly. By advocating for these specific policy changes, we can help prevent future wrongful convictions and ensure a more just criminal justice system.
