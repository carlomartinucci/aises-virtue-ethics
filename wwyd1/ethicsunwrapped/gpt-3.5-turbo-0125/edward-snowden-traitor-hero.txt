I would prioritize evaluating the content of the leaked documents to understand the extent of the information disclosed and its potential impact on national security. This would involve conducting a thorough analysis of the documents to determine the specific details revealed and the implications for ongoing government surveillance programs. By gaining a comprehensive understanding of the content, I would be better equipped to assess the severity of the breach and its consequences.

Additionally, I would review the internal mechanisms or channels available to Edward Snowden for reporting concerns about government surveillance programs. Understanding whether Snowden had viable options for raising his concerns through proper channels would provide valuable context for evaluating his decision to leak the documents. This assessment would help determine whether Snowden's actions were a result of a lack of alternative avenues for addressing his ethical concerns within the system.

By focusing on these specific actions, I aim to gather essential information to make an informed decision regarding the legality and ethical implications of Snowden's actions. This approach would enable a more nuanced understanding of the situation and guide the determination of an appropriate course of action based on the findings.
