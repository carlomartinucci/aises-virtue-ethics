In response to the scenario involving Rush Limbaugh's illegal acquisition of prescription drugs, I would take the following concrete actions:

1. Advocate for Comprehensive Addiction Treatment: I would work to ensure that individuals struggling with addiction, including Limbaugh, have access to comprehensive addiction treatment programs that address both the physical and psychological aspects of addiction. This includes providing support for detoxification, counseling, and ongoing therapy to address the root causes of addiction.

By advocating for comprehensive addiction treatment, we can help individuals like Limbaugh address their addiction in a holistic manner and reduce the likelihood of relapse.

This action focuses on providing practical support and resources to address addiction effectively and ethically.
