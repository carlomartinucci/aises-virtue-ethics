I would recommend consulting with the hospital's ethics committee to review the situation and provide guidance on the best course of action. The committee can offer expertise in navigating complex ethical dilemmas and help ensure that the patient's rights and well-being are prioritized. Additionally, I would suggest seeking input from a mental health advocate or legal expert to ensure that all decisions are made in the patient's best interest and in accordance with relevant laws and regulations. This multidisciplinary approach can help address the ethical concerns raised while also considering the urgency of the patient's condition.
