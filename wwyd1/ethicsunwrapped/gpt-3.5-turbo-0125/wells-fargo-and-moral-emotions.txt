One specific action that I would take in response to the Wells Fargo scandal is to establish a dedicated whistleblower hotline and protection program. This program would allow employees to report any unethical behavior, fraud, or misconduct anonymously and without fear of retaliation. The hotline would be managed by an independent third-party organization to ensure confidentiality and impartiality in handling reports.

By implementing a whistleblower hotline and protection program, we can encourage employees to come forward with any concerns they may have regarding unethical practices within the organization. This proactive approach would help uncover potential issues early on, allowing for swift investigation and remediation. Additionally, it would demonstrate a commitment to fostering a culture of transparency, accountability, and ethical behavior within the bank.

Furthermore, I would ensure that all reports made through the whistleblower hotline are thoroughly investigated, and appropriate actions are taken to address any substantiated claims. This would help rebuild trust with employees, customers, and stakeholders by showing a genuine commitment to upholding ethical standards and preventing future misconduct.
