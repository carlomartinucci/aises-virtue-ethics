To improve the response to the Wells Fargo scandal, I would prioritize the following specific action:

Conduct a transparent communication campaign to update all stakeholders on the findings of the internal review, the actions being taken to address the unethical behavior, and the implementation of new controls to prevent future misconduct. This communication should include regular updates on the progress of these initiatives and provide a platform for stakeholders to ask questions and provide feedback. By fostering open and honest communication, the bank can demonstrate its commitment to accountability and rebuilding trust with customers, employees, regulators, and shareholders.
