To address the aftermath of the "Varsity Blues" scandal, I would propose the following concrete actions:

1. Implement Mandatory Ethics Training: Collaborate with educational institutions to introduce mandatory ethics training for college counselors, admissions officers, and other relevant staff members. This training would focus on ethical decision-making, the consequences of fraudulent practices, and the importance of upholding integrity in the admissions process.

By providing specific guidance on ethical behavior and emphasizing the values of honesty and fairness, this training can help prevent future scandals and ensure that all individuals involved in the admissions process are equipped with the knowledge and tools to make ethical choices.

This action directly addresses the need to promote ethical behavior and integrity within the college admissions system, offering a practical solution to prevent similar fraudulent activities from occurring in the future.
