One specific action to address the aftermath of the "Varsity Blues" scandal would be to establish a mandatory ethics training program for college counselors, parents, and students involved in the college admissions process. This program would focus on educating participants about the importance of integrity, honesty, and ethical decision-making in the pursuit of higher education.

The training sessions could cover topics such as the consequences of academic dishonesty, the value of merit-based admissions, and the ethical implications of engaging in fraudulent activities to secure college acceptances. Participants would be required to attend these sessions annually as part of their involvement in the college admissions process.

By implementing this ethics training program, we can help instill a culture of integrity and transparency within the college admissions system. This proactive approach aims to prevent future scandals by equipping stakeholders with the knowledge and awareness needed to make ethical choices and uphold the principles of fairness and honesty in the pursuit of higher education.
