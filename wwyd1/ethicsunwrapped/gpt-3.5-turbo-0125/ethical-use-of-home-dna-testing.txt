I would collaborate with consumer advocacy groups and legal experts to develop a standardized set of guidelines for home DNA testing companies to ensure transparency and protect consumer privacy. These guidelines would include clear and concise consent forms that explicitly outline how genetic data will be used, shared, and stored. Additionally, I would work towards advocating for legislation that mandates these guidelines to be implemented by all companies operating in the home DNA testing industry. By establishing industry-wide standards and legal requirements, we can better protect consumers and uphold their rights when it comes to their genetic information.
