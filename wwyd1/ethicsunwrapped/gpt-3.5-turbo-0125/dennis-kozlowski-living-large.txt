I would conduct a thorough review of Tyco International's corporate governance policies and procedures during Dennis Kozlowski's tenure as CEO. This review would involve examining board meeting minutes, internal audit reports, and financial disclosures to assess the oversight mechanisms in place and determine if there were any lapses that allowed for the unauthorized bonuses and financial misconduct to occur. By analyzing the company's governance framework, I aim to identify any weaknesses or deficiencies that may have contributed to the ethical lapses observed during Kozlowski's leadership.
