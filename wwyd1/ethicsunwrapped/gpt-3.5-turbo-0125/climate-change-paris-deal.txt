To address the critique and provide a more specific and practical response to the scenario, I would focus on collaborating with local environmental organizations and community groups to organize a series of town hall meetings and workshops. These events would aim to educate the public on the urgency of climate action and the ethical dilemmas surrounding climate change, particularly in relation to social justice and inequality.

Additionally, I would work on developing a campaign to engage with policymakers at the local and national levels to advocate for stronger climate policies and commitments. This could involve drafting petitions, organizing letter-writing campaigns, and arranging meetings with elected officials to emphasize the importance of meeting emission reduction targets and prioritizing environmental justice in climate action plans.

By taking these specific actions, we can work towards raising awareness, fostering community engagement, and advocating for meaningful policy changes that address the ethical complexities of climate change while promoting a more sustainable and just future for all.
