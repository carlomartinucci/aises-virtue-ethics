I would immediately report the information provided by graduate assistant coach Mike McQueary to the police and child protective services. It is crucial to ensure that the allegations of sexual abuse by Jerry Sandusky are thoroughly investigated and that the victim receives the necessary support and resources to address the trauma they may have experienced. Additionally, I would work to hold accountable the individuals who were aware of the abuse but failed to take appropriate action, including Joe Paterno, Graham Spanier, Gary Schultz, and Tim Curley. It is essential to address the systemic failures and lack of response from those in positions of power to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future and to ensure justice for the victims.
