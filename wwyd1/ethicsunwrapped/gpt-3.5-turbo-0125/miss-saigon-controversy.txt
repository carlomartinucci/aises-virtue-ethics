To address the ethical concerns raised regarding the casting of Jonathan Pryce in the role of the Eurasian character in Miss Saigon, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Conduct an Inclusive Casting Call: I would work closely with the casting team to conduct a comprehensive casting call specifically targeting Asian actors for the role of 'the Engineer.' This would involve reaching out to Asian American theater communities, talent agencies, and performance schools to ensure a diverse pool of candidates.

By actively seeking out and inviting Asian actors to audition for the role, we can create a more inclusive and equitable casting process that provides opportunities for underrepresented performers.

This approach aligns with the goal of promoting diversity and authenticity in the production while addressing the concerns raised by the community regarding representation in the performing arts.
