To address the concerns raised about the casting of Jonathan Pryce in the role of the Eurasian character in Miss Saigon, I would take the following steps:

1. Conduct an open casting call specifically targeting Asian actors for the role of 'the Engineer.' This would involve reaching out to Asian American theater communities, casting agencies, and talent networks to ensure a diverse pool of candidates.

2. Collaborate with a diverse panel of industry professionals, including Asian American actors, directors, and casting directors, to review audition tapes and select potential candidates for the role. This panel would provide valuable insights and perspectives to ensure a fair and inclusive casting process.

3. Host in-person auditions for shortlisted Asian actors, providing them with the opportunity to showcase their talent and suitability for the role. This would allow for a more comprehensive evaluation beyond traditional criteria, taking into account factors such as acting ability, cultural understanding, and authenticity in portraying the character.

By actively seeking out and auditioning Asian actors for the role of 'the Engineer' in Miss Saigon, we can promote diversity, representation, and authenticity in the production while addressing the ethical concerns raised about casting practices.
