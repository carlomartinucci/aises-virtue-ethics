I would advise President Theodore Roosevelt to establish a formal legal review process within the executive branch to assess the constitutionality of his proposed actions. This process would involve appointing a team of legal experts, including constitutional scholars and advisors, to conduct thorough evaluations of the legal implications of his decisions. Before implementing any significant policy or executive action, President Roosevelt should require that the legal team provide a detailed analysis outlining the potential legal challenges and implications.

Additionally, I would recommend that President Roosevelt engage in regular consultations with the Attorney General to ensure alignment with existing laws and regulations. By seeking input from the nation's highest legal officer, President Roosevelt can gain valuable insights into the potential legal ramifications of his actions and make more informed decisions.

Furthermore, I would suggest that President Roosevelt establish a mechanism for seeking legal opinions from the Department of Justice on contentious issues to obtain an official legal perspective on the constitutionality of his proposed actions. This proactive approach to legal compliance would help President Roosevelt navigate the complexities of executive power while upholding the rule of law and avoiding potential conflicts with Congress or legal challenges.
