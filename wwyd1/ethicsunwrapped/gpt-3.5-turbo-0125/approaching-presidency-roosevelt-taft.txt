I would advise President Theodore Roosevelt to specifically consult with legal experts and constitutional scholars before taking any actions that may push the boundaries of executive power. In the case of creating national parks without regard for states' jurisdiction, I would recommend seeking a legal opinion on the extent of the president's authority in this matter. By proactively engaging with legal counsel, President Roosevelt can ensure that his decisions are legally sound and minimize the risk of potential conflicts with Congress or legal challenges. This approach would help strike a balance between serving the nation's needs and upholding the rule of law, ultimately strengthening the integrity of the presidency.
