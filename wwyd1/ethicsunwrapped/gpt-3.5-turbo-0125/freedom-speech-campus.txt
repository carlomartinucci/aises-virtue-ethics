I would organize a series of facilitated dialogues between student activists, university administrators, and faculty members to address the racial discrimination issues on campus. These dialogues would provide a safe space for all parties to express their perspectives, concerns, and experiences openly and respectfully. I would ensure that these dialogues are structured to promote active listening, empathy, and understanding among participants.

Additionally, I would collaborate with student groups and relevant stakeholders to develop and implement mandatory diversity and cultural sensitivity training for all members of the university community. This training would aim to increase awareness of racial issues, promote inclusivity, and equip individuals with the skills to address and prevent discrimination effectively.

Furthermore, I would work with university leadership to conduct a comprehensive review of existing policies and procedures related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. This review would identify areas for improvement and lead to the implementation of concrete policy changes that prioritize the safety and well-being of students of color on campus. These changes could include establishing clear protocols for responding to incidents of discrimination, enhancing support services for marginalized students, and creating mechanisms for accountability and transparency in addressing racial issues.

By taking these specific actions, we can work towards fostering a more inclusive and respectful campus environment where all students feel valued, respected, and supported.
