To improve the response, I would first conduct a detailed analysis of Ellen Pao's performance reviews and compare them with those of her male counterparts who were promoted ahead of her. I would specifically look for consistency in criticisms and potential biases in the evaluation process to determine if there was any gender discrimination in the promotion decisions.

Additionally, I would review the specific claims made by Pao against Kleiner Perkins, focusing on the evidence presented during the trial to assess the validity of each claim. This would involve examining the testimonies, documents, and any other relevant information to understand the context of the allegations and the responses provided by the defense.

Furthermore, I would study the jurors' testimonies to gain insights into their perspectives and considerations during the deliberation process. Understanding the factors that influenced the jury's decision, such as their interpretation of the evidence and legal arguments, would provide valuable information for evaluating the case and its implications for future instances of workplace discrimination.

By taking these specific actions, I aim to conduct a thorough and objective analysis of the case to determine the fairness of the verdict and identify any areas where improvements could be made in addressing workplace discrimination issues.
