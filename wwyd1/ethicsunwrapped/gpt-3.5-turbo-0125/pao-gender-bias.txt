I would start by thoroughly examining Ellen Pao's performance reviews and evaluations to identify any inconsistencies or biases in the feedback provided. Specifically, I would compare Pao's reviews with those of her male counterparts to determine if there were any disparities in the criticisms or evaluations given. This analysis would help in understanding the basis for the negative feedback Pao received and whether it was justified or potentially influenced by discriminatory practices.

Additionally, I would review the specific claims made by Pao against Kleiner Perkins, focusing on the allegations of gender discrimination, retaliation, and failure to prevent discrimination. By closely examining the evidence presented during the trial, including Pao's memo detailing harassment and exclusion at the firm, I would assess the validity of her claims and the extent to which Kleiner Perkins may have violated anti-discrimination laws.

Furthermore, I would study the testimonies of the jurors to gain insights into their perspectives and considerations during the deliberation process. Understanding the factors that influenced the jury's decision, such as the emphasis on performance reviews and character assessments, would provide valuable information on how the case was perceived and evaluated.

Overall, by conducting a detailed analysis of Pao's performance reviews, the specific claims against Kleiner Perkins, and the jurors' testimonies, I aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the case and the factors that led to the jury's verdict.
