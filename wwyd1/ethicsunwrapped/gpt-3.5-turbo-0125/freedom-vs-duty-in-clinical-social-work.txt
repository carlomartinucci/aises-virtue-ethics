In this scenario, I would schedule a consultation with a colleague or supervisor to discuss the ethical dilemma I am facing. During this consultation, I would seek guidance on how to navigate the conflict between my religious beliefs and the duty to provide unbiased treatment to the client. I would openly share my concerns and explore potential solutions that align with the ethical principles of the social work profession.

One specific action I would take is to engage in ongoing self-reflection and education to better understand how my religious beliefs may impact my work with clients who have different beliefs or identities. I would seek out training or resources on cultural competence and LGBTQ+ affirmative therapy to enhance my ability to provide inclusive and affirming care to all clients.

Additionally, I would have a transparent conversation with the client about the potential impact of my beliefs on our therapeutic relationship. I would express my commitment to their well-being and offer to explore alternative therapy options if they feel that my beliefs may hinder their progress or comfort in therapy.

By seeking guidance, engaging in self-reflection and education, and maintaining open communication with the client, I aim to navigate this ethical dilemma in a way that upholds the values of social work and prioritizes the client's needs and well-being.
