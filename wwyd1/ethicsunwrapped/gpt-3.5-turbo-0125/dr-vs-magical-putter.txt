One specific action that I would take in response to the scenario is to establish a formal editorial review board at Grantland. This board would consist of diverse members, including experts in journalism ethics, representatives from marginalized communities such as the transgender community, and internal staff members. The board would be responsible for reviewing sensitive articles before publication to ensure they meet ethical standards and do not cause harm to individuals or communities.

The editorial review board would provide a platform for in-depth discussions on ethical considerations, sensitivity towards marginalized groups, and responsible reporting practices. By involving a range of perspectives in the decision-making process, Grantland can better assess the potential impact of its articles and make informed decisions about publication.

Additionally, the board would serve as a mechanism for ongoing education and training for staff members, helping to increase awareness and understanding of ethical issues in journalism. This proactive approach can help prevent similar incidents in the future and foster a culture of ethical reporting at Grantland.
