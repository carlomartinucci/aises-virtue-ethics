To address the critique and provide a more practical response to the scenario, I would focus on implementing specific actions to enhance the ethical considerations surrounding social media use by college athletes:

1. Develop a Social Media Code of Conduct: I would work with the coaching staff, athletic department officials, and student-athlete representatives to create a detailed Social Media Code of Conduct. This document would outline specific guidelines on appropriate online behavior, including examples of prohibited content, privacy settings, and the importance of representing the university positively on social media platforms.

By creating a comprehensive Social Media Code of Conduct, we can provide clear expectations for college athletes regarding their online presence and help them understand the ethical responsibilities associated with social media use. This proactive approach aims to prevent incidents of inappropriate behavior and promote a culture of respect and professionalism among student-athletes.

Implementing a Social Media Code of Conduct would serve as a practical and tangible solution to address the ethical considerations highlighted in the scenario, offering specific guidance to athletes on navigating social media responsibly while representing the university in a positive light.
