I would start by convening a meeting with the coaching staff, athletic department officials, and student-athlete representatives to collaboratively review and update the existing social media policies. During this meeting, I would propose the inclusion of specific guidelines in the policies, such as examples of inappropriate content to avoid and recommendations for maintaining professionalism online.

To address potential resistance from athletes, I would organize interactive workshops focused on educating them about the impact of their social media presence and providing practical tips on responsible online behavior. These workshops would also serve as a platform for athletes to voice their concerns and engage in open discussions about the importance of representing the university positively on social media.

Additionally, I would implement a system for monitoring athletes' social media accounts using software like UDiligence. This tool would help identify any concerning content or keywords in posts, allowing for timely intervention and guidance to ensure compliance with the revised social media policies.

Lastly, I would establish a regular review process to assess the effectiveness of the updated policies and educational initiatives. This would involve collecting feedback from athletes and coaches, analyzing any incidents or trends related to social media use, and making necessary adjustments to continuously improve the guidelines and support mechanisms in place.
