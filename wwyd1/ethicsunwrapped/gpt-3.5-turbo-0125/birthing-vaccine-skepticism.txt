I would compile all the evidence and information regarding Andrew Wakefield's unethical behavior, including his failure to disclose conflicts of interest, manipulation of research data, and misleading statements to the public. I would then submit a detailed report to the General Medical Council, urging them to thoroughly investigate Wakefield's actions and consider revoking his medical registration. Additionally, I would reach out to reputable scientific journals and organizations to alert them about Wakefield's misconduct, aiming to prevent any further dissemination of his discredited theories. By taking these steps, I would work towards ensuring accountability for Wakefield's unethical conduct and protecting public health from the harmful effects of misinformation surrounding vaccines.
