I would not only report Andrew Wakefield's unethical behavior to the General Medical Council but also contact relevant medical journals and scientific organizations to retract the fraudulent research article published in The Lancet. By providing them with the evidence of Wakefield's misconduct and manipulation of research data, I would aim to ensure that the false information is corrected and no longer influences public perception or policy decisions. Retracting the article would help mitigate the damage caused by Wakefield's fraudulent claims and prevent further harm to public health.
