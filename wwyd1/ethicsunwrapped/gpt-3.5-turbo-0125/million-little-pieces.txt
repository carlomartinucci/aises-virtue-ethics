In response to the controversy surrounding James Frey's book "A Million Little Pieces," as the publisher Doubleday, I would immediately issue a public statement expressing our commitment to transparency and integrity. We would announce a comprehensive review of the book's content, led by a team of independent fact-checkers and literary experts. This review would include identifying and addressing any inaccuracies or fabrications found in the text.

Simultaneously, I would personally reach out to Oprah Winfrey's team to offer full cooperation in any investigations or discussions they wish to have regarding the situation. This would demonstrate our willingness to engage openly and honestly with all stakeholders involved.

Furthermore, I would convene a task force within Doubleday to revise and strengthen our editorial and marketing processes for vetting memoirs and non-fiction works. This task force would be responsible for developing and implementing stricter guidelines and procedures to ensure the accuracy and authenticity of all future publications.

By taking these concrete actions, we aim to rectify any misrepresentations, rebuild trust with readers and authors, and uphold the ethical standards of truth and integrity in publishing.
