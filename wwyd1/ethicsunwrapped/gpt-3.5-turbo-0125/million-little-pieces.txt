In response to the controversy surrounding James Frey's book A Million Little Pieces, as the publisher Doubleday, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Public Statement: Issue a public statement expressing regret for any misrepresentation in marketing the book as a memoir. Apologize for any inaccuracies and commit to conducting a thorough review of the book's content.

2. Review Process: Initiate a comprehensive review of the book's content to identify and address any exaggerations or fabrications. This review will involve a team of fact-checkers, editors, and legal advisors to ensure accuracy and transparency.

3. Cooperation with Oprah Winfrey: Reach out to Oprah Winfrey's team to offer full cooperation with any investigations or discussions regarding the controversy. Demonstrate a commitment to transparency and accountability in addressing the concerns raised.

4. Strengthen Guidelines: Convene a task force within the editorial and marketing teams to review and enhance the vetting and fact-checking processes for memoirs and non-fiction works. Implement stricter guidelines and procedures to prevent similar issues in the future.

5. Communication Strategy: Develop a communication strategy to keep readers, authors, and the literary community informed about the steps being taken to address the controversy. Provide regular updates on the progress of the review and any actions taken as a result.

By taking these specific actions, Doubleday can demonstrate a commitment to ethical standards, transparency, and accountability in addressing the controversy surrounding James Frey's book. These steps aim to rectify any inaccuracies, rebuild trust with stakeholders, and prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
