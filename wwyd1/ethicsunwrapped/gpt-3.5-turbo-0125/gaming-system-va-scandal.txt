I would immediately report the manipulation of wait times to the highest level of authority within the Veterans Administration, including the Inspector General's office. I would provide all evidence available, such as the email from the clerk admitting to gaming the system, to ensure a thorough investigation is conducted. Additionally, I would collaborate with the audit team to identify all instances of falsified data and hold those responsible accountable for their actions. To prevent future occurrences, I would propose implementing a system of regular audits and checks on wait time reporting, as well as mandatory ethics training for all staff involved in scheduling and reporting wait times. This proactive approach would help ensure transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct within the organization.
