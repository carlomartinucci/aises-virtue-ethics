I would immediately report the unethical practices of manipulating wait times within the Veterans Administration to the Inspector General's office for a thorough investigation. I would provide all available evidence, including the email from the clerk admitting to gaming the system, to ensure transparency and accountability. Additionally, I would work with a team to review and revise existing policies and procedures to prevent such behavior in the future. This would involve implementing stricter oversight mechanisms, conducting regular audits, and providing ethics training to all staff members involved in scheduling and reporting wait times. By taking these concrete steps, we can uphold the integrity of the VA's healthcare system and prioritize the timely and quality care of our veterans.
