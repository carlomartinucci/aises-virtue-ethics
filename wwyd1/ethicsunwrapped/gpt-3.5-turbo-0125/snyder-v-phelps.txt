In addition to recommending mental health support for Albert Snyder, I would suggest that he explore alternative legal avenues to seek justice and closure. One specific action he could take is to connect with civil rights organizations or advocacy groups that specialize in supporting individuals who have faced similar situations of harassment or emotional distress. These organizations may provide legal guidance, resources, and potential avenues for seeking further legal recourse or advocacy on his behalf. By reaching out to such groups, Snyder may find additional support and assistance in navigating the complexities of the legal system and exploring potential options for addressing the harm caused by the actions of the Westboro Baptist Church.
