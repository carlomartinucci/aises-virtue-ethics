I would recommend that Justice Scalia recuse himself from the case due to the appearance of bias stemming from his social interactions with Vice President Cheney, a defendant in the case. By recusing himself, Justice Scalia would uphold the integrity of the judicial process and avoid any perception of impropriety. Additionally, I would advise Justice Scalia to publicly disclose the reasons for his recusal to provide transparency and maintain public trust in the Supreme Court's decision-making process.
