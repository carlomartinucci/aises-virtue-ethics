I would recommend that Justice Scalia recuse himself from the case due to his social interactions with defendant Cheney, which could raise concerns about his impartiality. By recusing himself, Justice Scalia can uphold the integrity of the judicial process and avoid any appearance of bias. Additionally, I would advise Justice Scalia to refrain from engaging in social activities with individuals involved in cases before the Court in the future to maintain public trust in the fairness of the legal system.
