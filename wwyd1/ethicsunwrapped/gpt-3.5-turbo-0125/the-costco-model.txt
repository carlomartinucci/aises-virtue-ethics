One specific action I would take to improve employee treatment and success within the company is to conduct a thorough review of the current wage structure and benefits package. This review would involve benchmarking the company's compensation practices against industry standards and conducting internal assessments to ensure that employees are being fairly compensated for their work. If discrepancies are identified, adjustments would be made to align wages and benefits with market rates, aiming to provide competitive and equitable compensation for all employees. This action would demonstrate a commitment to valuing and investing in the well-being of the workforce, fostering a positive work environment and enhancing employee satisfaction and retention.
