To address the critique and provide a more practical response to the scenario, I would focus on implementing a comprehensive review of the company's wage structure and benefits package. This review would involve benchmarking against industry standards, conducting employee surveys to gather feedback on their needs and preferences, and analyzing turnover rates to identify areas for improvement.

Based on the findings of the review, I would propose specific actions such as:

1. Adjusting the wage structure to ensure it is competitive and equitable, taking into account factors such as job roles, experience levels, and regional cost of living.
2. Enhancing benefits packages to include comprehensive health insurance, retirement plans, and wellness programs that support employee well-being and financial security.
3. Implementing performance-based incentives and recognition programs to reward employees for their contributions and achievements.
4. Providing opportunities for skill development and career advancement through training programs, mentorship initiatives, and internal promotion pathways.
5. Establishing regular communication channels, such as town hall meetings or feedback sessions, to engage with employees, address their concerns, and involve them in decision-making processes.

By focusing on these specific actions, the company can demonstrate a commitment to ethical business practices that prioritize employee welfare and success. This approach not only aligns with the company's code of ethics but also contributes to a positive work culture, higher employee satisfaction, and ultimately, greater business success.
