I would have refused to change the students' answers on the standardized tests, even if pressured by the principal or other teachers to do so. Instead, I would have organized after-school tutoring sessions for students who needed extra help in preparing for the tests. I would have collaborated with other teachers to create study groups and provide additional resources such as practice exams and study guides. Additionally, I would have reached out to parents and guardians to involve them in their children's academic progress and seek their support in encouraging students to study and prepare diligently for the tests. By taking these proactive steps, I would have demonstrated a commitment to academic integrity and the well-being of the students while also working towards improving their performance in a fair and ethical manner.
