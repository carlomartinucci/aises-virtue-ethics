To address the public's concerns and restore trust in the executive branch following the controversial pardon of Richard Nixon, President Ford should take the following specific action: 

President Ford should convene a bipartisan commission composed of respected legal experts, historians, and public figures to conduct a thorough review of the Watergate scandal and the decision to pardon Nixon. The commission should be tasked with examining all relevant documents, interviewing key individuals involved, and assessing the ethical implications of the pardon. The commission's findings and recommendations should be made public in a comprehensive report to ensure transparency and accountability.

By establishing an independent commission to investigate the pardon and the Watergate scandal, President Ford can demonstrate a commitment to addressing the public's concerns and upholding ethical standards in government. This proactive approach will help rebuild trust in the executive branch and provide clarity on the decision-making process surrounding the pardon.
