To address the public's concerns and restore trust in the executive branch following the controversial pardon of Richard Nixon, President Ford should take concrete steps to demonstrate transparency and accountability. One specific action he could take is to appoint an independent commission to investigate the Watergate scandal and the circumstances surrounding the pardon. This commission should be comprised of respected individuals with expertise in law, ethics, and government oversight.

The commission's mandate would be to conduct a thorough review of the events leading up to the Watergate scandal, Nixon's actions, the pardon decision, and any potential agreements between Ford and Nixon. The commission should have the authority to subpoena witnesses, review documents, and provide a comprehensive report to the public detailing their findings and recommendations.

By appointing an independent commission, President Ford would show a commitment to transparency and accountability, allowing for a thorough examination of the pardon decision and its ethical implications. This action would help address the public's concerns, provide clarity on the decision-making process, and demonstrate a willingness to uphold ethical standards in government.
