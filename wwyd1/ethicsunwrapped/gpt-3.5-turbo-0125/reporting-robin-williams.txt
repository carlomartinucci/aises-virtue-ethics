To address the concerns raised in the critique, I would implement a mandatory training program for all journalists and editorial staff on responsible reporting practices when covering sensitive topics like suicide. This training would include:

1. Education on the ethical considerations involved in reporting on suicides, emphasizing the importance of respecting the privacy and dignity of the deceased and their family.
  
2. Guidelines on how to handle sensitive information, such as graphic details of suicide methods, and the potential impact on vulnerable individuals in the audience.

3. Case studies and examples of best practices in reporting on mental health issues and suicide prevention to provide practical insights for journalists.

By implementing this training program, we can ensure that all staff members are equipped with the knowledge and skills to approach sensitive topics with care and respect, ultimately improving the quality and ethical standards of our reporting on such critical issues.
