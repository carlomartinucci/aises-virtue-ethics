I would organize a training session for all journalists and staff involved in reporting on sensitive topics like suicide. This training would focus on responsible reporting practices, including guidelines on avoiding excessive detail about suicide methods. I would invite mental health experts to provide insights on the potential impact of media coverage on suicide prevention efforts. Additionally, I would create a resource guide with helplines and mental health support services to be included in all suicide-related news coverage. This proactive approach aims to ensure that our reporting is both informative and respectful of the privacy and dignity of those affected by suicide.
