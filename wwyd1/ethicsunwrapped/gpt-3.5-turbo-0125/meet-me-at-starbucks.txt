I would immediately reach out to Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson to offer a sincere apology on behalf of Starbucks for the unjust treatment they experienced. I would personally meet with them to listen to their perspectives, express empathy, and discuss ways to make amends. This could include offering financial compensation for any legal fees incurred, providing support for any emotional distress caused, and ensuring that they feel heard and respected throughout the process.

In addition, I would conduct a thorough review of the company's policies and procedures related to customer interactions, diversity, and inclusion. Any identified gaps or shortcomings would be addressed through targeted retraining programs for all employees, with a focus on recognizing and addressing implicit bias in day-to-day operations. I would also implement a system for ongoing monitoring and evaluation to ensure that these changes are effectively implemented and sustained over time.

Furthermore, I would engage with community leaders, civil rights organizations, and diversity experts to develop a comprehensive plan for promoting diversity and inclusion within Starbucks. This plan would involve initiatives such as community outreach programs, partnerships with local organizations, and regular diversity training sessions for employees at all levels of the organization. By fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect, we can work towards creating a safe and welcoming environment for all customers, employees, and stakeholders.
