I would report the sign-stealing scheme known as "Codebreaker" directly to the MLB commissioner's office, providing them with all the information I have about the scheme, including how it was carried out, who was involved, and the impact it had on the game. Additionally, I would suggest implementing stricter monitoring protocols during games to prevent future instances of electronic sign-stealing. This could involve regular audits of team communications and technology use, as well as increased education and enforcement of MLB rules regarding fair play and sportsmanship.
