I would schedule a meeting with Alan Barron to discuss the incident and understand his perspective on the lesson. During the meeting, I would ask Barron to provide a detailed explanation of his intentions behind showing the video and how he framed the discussion around it. I would also offer support and guidance on how to approach sensitive historical topics with cultural sensitivity in the future.

Additionally, I would organize a professional development workshop for all teachers in the district on teaching about sensitive historical topics related to race and discrimination. The workshop would focus on providing strategies and resources for promoting cultural awareness and inclusivity in the classroom. This training would help educators navigate potentially controversial content in a respectful and educational manner.

Furthermore, I would facilitate a dialogue between Barron, the assistant principal, and parents to address any misunderstandings and concerns regarding the lesson. This open communication would allow for a constructive discussion on how to approach similar topics in a way that is educational and culturally sensitive.

Overall, by engaging with all stakeholders, providing targeted support and training, and fostering open communication, I aim to ensure that incidents like the one involving Alan Barron are handled thoughtfully and proactively in the future.
