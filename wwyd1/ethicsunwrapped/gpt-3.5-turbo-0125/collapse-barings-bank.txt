To address the situation at Barings Bank involving Nick Leeson's actions, I would immediately schedule a meeting with senior management to present the evidence of hidden losses and escalating risks associated with Leeson's speculative trading. I would recommend implementing a real-time monitoring system for all trading activities to detect irregularities and excessive risk-taking promptly.

In addition, I would propose the establishment of a dedicated risk management committee tasked with conducting regular audits of trading accounts and ensuring compliance with risk limits and regulations. This committee would also be responsible for reviewing and approving all high-risk trades to prevent unauthorized activities like those carried out by Leeson.

Furthermore, I would suggest the implementation of mandatory ethics and compliance training for all employees, emphasizing the importance of transparency, integrity, and accountability in their roles. This training would help foster a culture of ethical behavior and encourage employees to report any suspicious activities or concerns through a confidential whistleblower hotline.

By taking these specific actions, we can enhance oversight, strengthen risk management practices, and promote a culture of ethical conduct within the organization to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
