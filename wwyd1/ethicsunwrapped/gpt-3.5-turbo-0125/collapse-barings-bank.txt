I would immediately report my concerns about Nick Leeson's trading activities to senior management at Barings Bank. I would compile detailed evidence of the hidden losses, speculative trading, and escalating risks posed by Leeson's actions. I would emphasize the urgency of the situation and the potential threat to the bank's stability.

In addition, I would recommend implementing regular and thorough audits of trading accounts, increasing transparency in reporting, and establishing clear protocols for addressing losses and escalating risks. I would propose the creation of a whistleblower hotline or anonymous reporting system to encourage early detection of risky behavior within the organization.

Furthermore, I would suggest conducting a comprehensive review of the bank's internal controls and governance structure to identify weaknesses that allowed Leeson's actions to go undetected. I would advocate for specific training programs to educate employees on ethical trading practices and the importance of transparency in all financial transactions.

Overall, my focus would be on taking immediate action to address the situation, enhance oversight and risk management procedures, and strengthen internal controls to prevent a similar crisis from occurring in the future.
