To address the ethical concerns raised in the critique and provide a more practical response to the Ebola epidemic in Liberia, I would prioritize the following specific actions:

1. Establish a Joint Task Force: I would propose the creation of a Joint Task Force comprising representatives from the U.S. military, local healthcare authorities, international aid organizations, and community leaders. This task force would facilitate collaboration, information sharing, and decision-making to ensure a coordinated and effective response to the epidemic.

By bringing together diverse stakeholders, we can leverage the expertise and resources of each group while promoting transparency and inclusivity in the decision-making process. This approach would address concerns about militarization, uphold principles of neutrality, and enhance the ethical integrity of the relief efforts.

By implementing this Joint Task Force, we can enhance coordination, communication, and accountability in the response to the Ebola epidemic in Liberia, ultimately leading to a more ethical and practical intervention.
