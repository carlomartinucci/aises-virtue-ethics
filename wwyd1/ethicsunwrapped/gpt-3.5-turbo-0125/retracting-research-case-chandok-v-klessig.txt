I would recommend initiating a formal process of mediation between Meena Chandok and Daniel Klessig to facilitate open communication and potentially reach a resolution outside of the courtroom. This could involve appointing a neutral third party, such as a professional mediator or an ethics committee, to facilitate discussions between the two parties. The goal would be to address concerns, clarify misunderstandings, and explore potential ways to mitigate the damage to Chandok's career and reputation. By engaging in a structured mediation process, both parties may have the opportunity to express their perspectives, seek common ground, and work towards a mutually acceptable outcome.
