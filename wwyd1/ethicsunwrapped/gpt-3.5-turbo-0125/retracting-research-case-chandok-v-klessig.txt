I would schedule a meeting with Meena Chandok to discuss the concerns raised regarding the replication of the research results and the subsequent retraction of the article. During this meeting, I would aim to facilitate an open and honest conversation to address any misunderstandings and clarify the reasons behind the actions taken by the research team. I would also offer Chandok the opportunity to provide any additional information or insights that could help shed light on the situation.

Furthermore, I would seek guidance from research integrity experts or ethics committees to ensure that all steps taken align with best practices in handling such cases. By consulting with experts in the field, we can ensure that the situation is approached ethically and transparently, with a focus on upholding the integrity of the research process and protecting the reputations of all parties involved.

Overall, by engaging in open communication with Chandok and seeking guidance from research integrity experts, we can work towards resolving the issues in a fair and ethical manner while upholding the principles of transparency and accountability in scientific research.
