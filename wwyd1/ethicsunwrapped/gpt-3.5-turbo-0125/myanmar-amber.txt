I would initiate a collaborative effort with international organizations, local authorities, and stakeholders to establish a certification system for ethically sourced Myanmar amber fossils. This certification would require thorough documentation of the fossil's origin, ensuring that it was obtained through legal and ethical means. To enforce this system, regular audits and inspections could be conducted by independent third parties to verify compliance with the ethical sourcing guidelines. By promoting transparency and accountability in the fossil trade, we can work towards reducing the negative impacts associated with the extraction and sale of these valuable specimens.
