I would initiate a comprehensive investigation into the treatment and welfare of bulls used in bullfighting by collaborating with animal welfare organizations and independent veterinarians specializing in livestock welfare. This partnership would involve conducting unannounced visits to bull breeding facilities to assess the living conditions and treatment of the bulls. Additionally, I would work with local authorities to monitor and regulate the transportation of bulls to bullfighting arenas to ensure compliance with animal welfare standards.

Based on the findings from these investigations, I would propose the implementation of mandatory welfare guidelines for bullfighting events, including requirements for the humane treatment of bulls before, during, and after the fights. These guidelines would aim to minimize the suffering of the bulls and ensure their well-being throughout their involvement in bullfighting activities.

Furthermore, I would engage in dialogue with bullfighting associations, bullfighters, and cultural experts to discuss potential alternatives to traditional bullfighting practices that prioritize animal welfare while preserving cultural heritage. This collaborative approach would seek to find a middle ground that respects both the cultural significance of bullfighting and the ethical treatment of animals involved in the practice.

By taking these specific actions, I aim to address the ethical concerns surrounding bullfighting by promoting transparency, accountability, and the welfare of the bulls involved in these events.
