I would collaborate with animal welfare organizations and local authorities to conduct regular inspections of bullfighting arenas to ensure compliance with animal welfare regulations. These inspections would involve assessing the living conditions of the bulls, their treatment during transportation, and their well-being before, during, and after the bullfight. By working closely with experts in animal welfare and enforcement agencies, we can monitor and enforce strict guidelines to protect the welfare of the bulls involved in bullfighting. Additionally, I would propose the implementation of mandatory training programs for bullfighters on humane handling practices and stress reduction techniques to minimize the suffering of the bulls during the fights. This proactive approach aims to balance cultural traditions with ethical considerations and promote a more humane treatment of animals in bullfighting.
