I would ensure that immediate support and resources are provided to the victims of sexual assault within the Baylor community. This would involve setting up a dedicated support system, including counseling services and advocacy groups, to assist survivors in coping with their experiences and navigating the reporting and investigative processes. Additionally, I would work to establish a survivor-centered approach that prioritizes the well-being and empowerment of those affected by sexual violence. By focusing on the needs and rights of the survivors, we can create a more compassionate and effective response to these traumatic incidents.
