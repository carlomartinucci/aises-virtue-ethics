One specific action that I would take in response to the sign-stealing scandal within the organization is to establish a comprehensive and independent investigation team. This team would consist of external experts in ethics, compliance, and sports integrity, who would lead a thorough examination of the extent of the cheating scheme and identify all individuals involved.

The investigation team would be tasked with reviewing all available evidence, conducting interviews with players, coaches, and staff members, and analyzing the organizational culture that allowed such unethical behavior to persist. They would also collaborate closely with MLB investigators to ensure transparency and accountability throughout the process.

By engaging external experts, the organization can demonstrate a commitment to impartiality and integrity in uncovering the truth behind the scandal. This approach would not only help in identifying the full scope of the wrongdoing but also in implementing effective corrective actions to prevent similar incidents in the future.
