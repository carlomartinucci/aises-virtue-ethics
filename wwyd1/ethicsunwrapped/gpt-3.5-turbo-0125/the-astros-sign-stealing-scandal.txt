To address the sign-stealing scandal within the organization, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Internal Investigation:** I would appoint an independent investigative team to thoroughly examine the extent of the sign-stealing scheme within the organization. This team would have full access to all relevant information and individuals involved.

2. **Disciplinary Actions:** Based on the findings of the investigation, I would take swift and decisive disciplinary actions against all individuals found to be complicit in the cheating scandal. This could include fines, suspensions, or termination of contracts, depending on the level of involvement.

3. **Policy Implementation:** I would establish and enforce strict policies and procedures to prevent any future instances of cheating or unethical behavior. This would involve regular training sessions for players, coaches, and staff on the importance of fair play and sportsmanship.

4. **Public Apology:** I would issue a sincere and public apology on behalf of the organization to fans, players, and other teams affected by the scandal. This apology would acknowledge the wrongdoing, express remorse, and outline steps being taken to rectify the situation.

5. **Rebuilding Trust:** I would work closely with MLB and other stakeholders to rebuild trust and integrity within the organization and the broader baseball community. This could involve transparency in communication, ongoing dialogue with affected parties, and a commitment to upholding ethical standards moving forward.

By taking these specific actions, the organization can demonstrate a genuine commitment to accountability, transparency, and ethical conduct in the aftermath of the sign-stealing scandal.
