After the fundraising dinner, I would discreetly approach Mary and suggest that we schedule a meeting to discuss the interaction with Robert. During the meeting, I would recommend that we send a follow-up email to Robert, thanking him for his generous donation and providing more specific information about Casa Tia Maria's mission and the population it serves. In the email, we would clarify that the shelter primarily supports Central American immigrants in need of temporary housing and assistance.

Furthermore, I would propose that we create a donor education program for all staff members involved in fundraising activities. This program would focus on effectively communicating the organization's mission, values, and the demographics of the individuals served by Casa Tia Maria. By equipping staff with the necessary knowledge and skills to address potential misunderstandings with donors, we can ensure transparency and accuracy in our fundraising efforts.

Lastly, I would suggest that we develop a protocol for handling similar situations in the future. This protocol could include guidelines on how to correct misperceptions in real-time during donor interactions and strategies for maintaining open and honest communication with potential donors. By proactively addressing these issues, we can uphold the integrity of Casa Tia Maria's mission and build stronger relationships with donors based on transparency and mutual understanding.
