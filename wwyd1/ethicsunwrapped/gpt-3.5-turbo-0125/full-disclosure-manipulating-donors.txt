I would discreetly approach Mary after the fundraising dinner and suggest scheduling a follow-up meeting with Robert to provide him with more detailed information about Casa Tia Maria's mission and the population it serves. During this meeting, I would recommend that Mary clarify the organization's focus on assisting Central American immigrants in need of temporary shelter, emphasizing the importance of supporting all individuals regardless of their citizenship status. Additionally, I would propose creating a donor education program to ensure that all staff members are equipped to effectively communicate the organization's mission and values to potential donors. This program could include training sessions, informational materials, and role-playing exercises to help staff members navigate conversations with donors and address any misunderstandings that may arise.
