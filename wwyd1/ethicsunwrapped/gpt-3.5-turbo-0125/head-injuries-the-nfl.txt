I would recommend implementing mandatory baseline neurocognitive testing for all football players at the professional level. This would involve conducting comprehensive assessments of players' cognitive functions, memory, and reaction times before the start of each season. By establishing a baseline measurement of each player's brain health, medical professionals would be better equipped to monitor any changes or declines in cognitive function throughout the season.

Additionally, I would suggest increasing player education on the risks of head injuries and the importance of reporting symptoms promptly. Implementing regular educational sessions for players, coaches, and staff on recognizing the signs of concussions and the potential long-term consequences of repetitive head impacts can help create a culture of safety and awareness within the sport.

Furthermore, I would recommend enhancing the league's concussion protocol by ensuring that independent medical professionals have the authority to evaluate and clear players before they return to play after a head injury. This would help prevent premature return-to-play decisions and prioritize the long-term health and well-being of the players.

Overall, by implementing baseline neurocognitive testing, increasing player education, and enhancing the concussion protocol, the NFL can take concrete steps to address the ethical concerns surrounding football-related brain injuries and prioritize the safety and health of its players.
