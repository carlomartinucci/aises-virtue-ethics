In addition to conducting a thorough review of academic records and interviewing key individuals involved in the academic fraud at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC), I would prioritize providing support and resources to the student-athletes who may have been impacted by the fraudulent practices. Specifically, I would establish a dedicated academic support program for these student-athletes to address any academic challenges or discrepancies resulting from their involvement in the fraudulent courses.

This support program would offer personalized academic counseling, tutoring services, and opportunities for academic redemption to ensure that the affected student-athletes have the necessary resources to succeed academically despite the unfair circumstances they faced. Additionally, I would work closely with the university's counseling services to provide emotional support and guidance to help these students navigate the challenges and uncertainties resulting from the academic fraud.

By prioritizing the well-being and academic success of the student-athletes affected by the fraud, we can demonstrate a commitment to ethical practices and integrity while also addressing the immediate needs of those impacted by the fraudulent activities at UNC.
