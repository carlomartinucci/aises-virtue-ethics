I would prioritize providing support and resources to the student-athletes who were impacted by the academic fraud at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC). To address the academic repercussions they may face, I would establish a dedicated academic support program tailored to their needs. This program would offer tutoring, counseling services, and academic advising to help these students navigate their academic journey and ensure they receive a quality education.

Additionally, I would work closely with the affected student-athletes to develop individualized academic plans that take into account any challenges or gaps in their education resulting from the fraudulent practices. These plans would focus on academic growth, skill development, and ensuring that the students have the necessary support to succeed academically.

Furthermore, I would prioritize transparency and communication with the university community by organizing town hall meetings, informational sessions, and open forums to address concerns, provide updates on the investigation, and outline the steps being taken to prevent future incidents of academic fraud. This open dialogue would help rebuild trust, foster accountability, and demonstrate the university's commitment to upholding academic integrity.

By focusing on supporting the affected student-athletes, implementing tailored academic programs, and promoting transparency within the university community, we can work towards rectifying the consequences of the academic fraud at UNC and ensuring that all students receive a meaningful and ethical education.
