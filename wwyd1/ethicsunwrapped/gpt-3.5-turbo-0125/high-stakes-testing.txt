I would organize a series of town hall meetings involving parents, teachers, students, administrators, and community members to discuss the impact of high stakes testing on education. These meetings would provide a platform for stakeholders to share their perspectives and concerns openly.

Additionally, I would collaborate with educators to develop a pilot program that integrates project-based assessments into the curriculum. This program would allow students to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in a more holistic manner, moving away from solely relying on standardized testing.

Furthermore, I would work with policymakers to advocate for a comprehensive review of the current assessment system and propose reforms that prioritize student well-being and educational quality. This could involve lobbying for changes in state assessment policies to reduce the emphasis on high stakes testing and explore alternative evaluation methods.

By taking these concrete actions, we can address the ethical concerns surrounding high stakes testing, involve stakeholders in the decision-making process, and work towards creating a more balanced and student-centered approach to assessment in education.
