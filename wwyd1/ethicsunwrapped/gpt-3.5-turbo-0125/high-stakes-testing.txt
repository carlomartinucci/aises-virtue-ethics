To address the concerns raised in the critique, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Implement Student Advisory Councils: I would establish student advisory councils at schools to provide a platform for students to voice their opinions on high stakes testing. These councils would meet regularly to discuss their experiences, concerns, and suggestions regarding assessments. This would ensure that student perspectives are considered in decision-making processes.

By involving students directly in discussions about high stakes testing, we can gain valuable insights into how these assessments impact them and tailor solutions that prioritize their well-being and educational experience. This approach would empower students to be active participants in shaping their education and foster a sense of ownership over their learning journey.
