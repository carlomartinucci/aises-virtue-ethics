In response to the scenario involving Chris Correa's unauthorized access to the Houston Astros' internal database, I would take the following concrete actions to address the ethical and security implications:

1. Implement Strict Access Controls: I would review and enhance the organization's access control policies to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive information. This would involve regularly updating user permissions, enforcing multi-factor authentication, and conducting periodic audits to monitor access levels.

By strengthening access controls, we can minimize the risk of unauthorized individuals gaining entry to confidential data and prevent incidents like the one involving Chris Correa from occurring in the future. This proactive approach will help uphold ethical standards and protect the organization's integrity and reputation.
