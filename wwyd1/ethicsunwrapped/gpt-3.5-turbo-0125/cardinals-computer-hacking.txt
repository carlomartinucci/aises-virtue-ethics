In response to the scenario involving Chris Correa's unethical actions, I would take the following specific actions within the organization:

1. Conduct an immediate internal investigation to determine the extent of any potential data breaches and unauthorized access to confidential information. This investigation would involve reviewing access logs, interviewing employees, and analyzing any suspicious activities that may have occurred.

By conducting a thorough internal investigation, we can identify any potential security vulnerabilities and take corrective actions to prevent similar incidents in the future. This proactive approach demonstrates our commitment to upholding ethical standards and protecting sensitive information within the organization.
