I would collaborate with external labor rights organizations and industry experts to conduct independent audits of Apple's supply chain, focusing specifically on the tin sourcing practices in Indonesia. These audits would involve on-site visits to the mines and interviews with workers to assess working conditions and ensure compliance with ethical standards. Any violations or discrepancies found would be documented and reported to Apple's management for immediate action. Additionally, I would recommend implementing a transparent and accountable monitoring system that includes regular follow-up audits to track progress and ensure sustained improvements in supplier practices.
