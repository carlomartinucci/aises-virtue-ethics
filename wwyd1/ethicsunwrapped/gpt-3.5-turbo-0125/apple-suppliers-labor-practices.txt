I would collaborate with external labor rights organizations and industry experts to conduct a comprehensive audit of Apple's supply chain, focusing specifically on the tin sourcing practices in Indonesia. This audit would involve on-site visits to the mines, interviews with workers, and a thorough review of documentation to assess the working conditions and environmental impact.

Upon identifying any violations or unethical practices, I would compile a detailed report outlining the findings and recommendations for improvement. This report would be shared with Apple's management, along with a clear timeline for implementing corrective actions.

In addition, I would work with Apple to establish a transparent monitoring and auditing system that includes regular follow-up visits to supplier facilities and ongoing communication with workers to ensure compliance with ethical standards. This system would also involve setting up a grievance mechanism for workers to report any concerns or violations anonymously.

By taking these specific actions, we can work towards improving the working conditions and environmental practices in Apple's supply chain, while also holding the company accountable for upholding ethical standards.
