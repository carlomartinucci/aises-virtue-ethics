One specific action I would take to address the points raised in the critique is to establish a compensation fund for the athletes who were victims of the doping program in East Germany. This fund would provide financial support to cover medical expenses related to the long-term health consequences they have suffered as a result of the forced doping. Additionally, the fund could offer counseling services to support the mental well-being of the affected athletes who may have experienced trauma or distress.

By setting up a compensation fund, we would not only acknowledge the injustices faced by the athletes but also provide tangible support to help them cope with the physical and emotional repercussions of the doping program. This action would demonstrate a commitment to the well-being and rights of the athletes who were exploited and harmed by the unethical practices of the East German sports authorities.
