One specific action I would take in response to the scenario is to establish a compensation fund for the athletes who were victims of the doping program in East Germany. This fund would provide financial support to the affected athletes to help cover medical expenses related to the long-term health consequences they may have experienced as a result of the doping. Additionally, the fund could offer counseling services to support the mental well-being of the athletes who were coerced or pressured into doping. By providing financial compensation and mental health support, we can address the immediate needs of the athletes and acknowledge the harm they have endured.
