To address the impact of the PRWORA on low-income families and individuals, I would prioritize engaging directly with individuals affected by the welfare reform. This would involve conducting interviews and focus groups with welfare recipients to understand their experiences, challenges, and needs. By listening to their perspectives, I can gain valuable insights into the real-world implications of the policy and identify areas for improvement.

Additionally, I would collaborate with social workers and advocacy groups to assess the effectiveness of the work requirements and time limits imposed by the PRWORA. By working closely with these stakeholders, I can gather diverse viewpoints and expertise to inform potential policy changes that better support the long-term economic stability and well-being of low-income individuals.

Furthermore, I would conduct a detailed analysis of data on welfare caseloads, employment rates, and poverty levels to evaluate the outcomes of the welfare reform. This analysis would help me identify trends, disparities, and areas where the policy may have fallen short in achieving its intended goals. Based on this data-driven approach, I can develop evidence-based recommendations for policy adjustments that address the challenges faced by low-income families and individuals.

Overall, by combining direct engagement with affected individuals, collaboration with stakeholders, and data analysis, I aim to develop practical and ethically sound solutions to improve the welfare system and support those in need.
