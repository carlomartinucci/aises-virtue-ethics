During the meeting where the break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office was proposed and approved, I would have immediately raised objections to the illegal and unethical nature of the operation. I would have suggested exploring legal avenues, such as seeking a warrant through proper channels, to obtain any relevant information in a lawful manner. If necessary, I would have recommended consulting with legal experts or authorities to ensure that any actions taken were in compliance with the law.

Additionally, I would have proposed conducting a thorough review of the situation to assess the actual national security implications of the leak and determine if there were alternative, legal means to address the issue. I would have emphasized the importance of upholding ethical standards and respecting individuals' rights, even in the pursuit of national security objectives.

If the proposed course of action remained unchanged, I would have documented my objections and concerns in writing, ensuring that there was a clear record of my ethical stance on the matter. This documentation could serve as evidence of my commitment to upholding legal and ethical standards, even in challenging circumstances.
