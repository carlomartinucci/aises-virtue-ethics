During the meeting where the break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office was proposed and approved, I would have immediately raised objections to the illegal and unethical nature of the operation. I would have suggested exploring legal avenues to address the leak of sensitive information, such as seeking a court order or working with law enforcement agencies. If necessary, I would have recommended consulting with legal experts to ensure that any actions taken were in compliance with the law.

Furthermore, I would have emphasized the importance of respecting individuals' privacy rights and ethical standards, regardless of the perceived national security crisis. I would have proposed conducting a thorough review of the situation to identify alternative strategies that align with legal and ethical principles. If the proposed course of action remained illegal and unethical, I would have refused to participate and reported the matter to appropriate authorities or superiors.
