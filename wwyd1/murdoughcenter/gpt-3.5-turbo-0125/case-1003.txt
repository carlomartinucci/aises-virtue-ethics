To address the critique and provide a more ethically sound and practical response, I would focus on a specific action that aligns with ethical conduct in the job search scenario:

I would proactively engage in salary negotiations with the potential employers once the firm offers are received. This involves researching industry standards for salaries in the new location, considering the cost of living adjustments, and preparing a clear rationale for the desired salary range based on my qualifications and experience. During the negotiation process, I would aim to find a mutually beneficial agreement that reflects my value to the company while being fair and transparent in my communication. This approach ensures that I advocate for my worth ethically and professionally, setting a positive tone for the working relationship with the future employer.
