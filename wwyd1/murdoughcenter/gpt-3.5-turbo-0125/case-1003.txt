One specific action I would take at this point is to prepare a list of key points for negotiation once I receive firm offers from the engineering firms. This would involve identifying my priorities, such as salary, benefits, work-life balance, and potential for growth within the company. I would also research industry standards for compensation in the new location to ensure that any offers are competitive.

Additionally, I would practice effective negotiation techniques, such as clearly articulating my value to the company, listening actively to the employer's perspective, and finding mutually beneficial solutions. By approaching the negotiation process ethically and strategically, I aim to secure a position that aligns with my career goals and values while maintaining a positive and professional relationship with the potential employers.
