Clayton should have a private conversation with Eleanor to discuss her current situation and explore potential solutions together. During this conversation, Clayton can express his understanding of Eleanor's challenges and acknowledge her valuable contributions to the department over the years. He should then propose the idea of temporarily adjusting her role within the Public Works department to better accommodate her health and personal circumstances.

Clayton can suggest reassigning Eleanor to a role that requires less physical and mental strain, such as focusing on administrative tasks or providing support in a different capacity. By involving Eleanor in the decision-making process and showing empathy towards her situation, Clayton can ensure that the solution is tailored to her needs and preferences.

Additionally, Clayton should communicate with the rest of the team, including the City Engineer/Deputy Director Allan, to explain the rationale behind the decision to adjust Eleanor's role. By fostering transparency and open communication, Clayton can mitigate any potential concerns or misunderstandings within the department.

Overall, by proactively addressing Eleanor's challenges through a collaborative and empathetic approach, Clayton can demonstrate his commitment to supporting his team members during difficult times while also maintaining the department's operational efficiency.
