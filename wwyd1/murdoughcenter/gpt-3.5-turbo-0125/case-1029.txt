To address Eleanor's situation in a more sustainable manner, Clayton should consider implementing a phased transition plan for her within the Public Works department. This plan would involve gradually shifting her responsibilities to better match her current capabilities and energy levels while also providing support and training to help her adapt to the new role.

Initially, Clayton could meet with Eleanor to discuss her health challenges and personal circumstances openly and compassionately. He should express his appreciation for her years of dedicated service and explain the need to adjust her role within the department to better support her well-being.

Next, Clayton could work with Eleanor to identify tasks and duties that she can comfortably handle given her current situation. This could involve reallocating some of her responsibilities to other team members, restructuring her workload, or providing additional assistance as needed.

Simultaneously, Clayton should start the process of training and mentoring a successor for Eleanor's current position. By proactively preparing for Eleanor's eventual transition, Clayton can ensure a smooth handover of responsibilities without disrupting the department's operations.

Throughout this phased transition, Clayton should maintain open communication with all stakeholders, including Eleanor, the City Engineer/Deputy Director, and other team members. By keeping everyone informed and involved in the process, Clayton can foster a supportive and collaborative environment that prioritizes both Eleanor's well-being and the department's efficiency.

By implementing a structured and compassionate transition plan for Eleanor, Clayton can demonstrate ethical leadership, support his team members effectively, and navigate this challenging situation with integrity and professionalism.
