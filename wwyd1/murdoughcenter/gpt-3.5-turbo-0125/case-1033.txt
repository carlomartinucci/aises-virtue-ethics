Dianne should schedule a meeting with Warren to discuss her concerns about the potential impact on the old water main in Shadyvale. During the meeting, she should express her commitment to following State DOT policy and explain the implications of deviating from the original design. Dianne should present alternative solutions that align with the policy, such as exploring cost-effective ways to address any necessary utility conflicts without significantly increasing the project's budget.

Additionally, Dianne should document the meeting and any decisions made regarding the design to ensure transparency and accountability. If Warren insists on changing the design to impact the water main, Dianne should consider escalating the issue to a higher authority within the organization or seeking guidance from an ethics committee to address the ethical implications of the proposed changes.

By proactively addressing her concerns with Warren, presenting alternative solutions, and documenting the decision-making process, Dianne can uphold ethical standards, adhere to State DOT policy, and navigate the situation effectively while maintaining her professional integrity.
