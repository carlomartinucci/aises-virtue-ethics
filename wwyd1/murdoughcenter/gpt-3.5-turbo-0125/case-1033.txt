Dianne should document her concerns about the potential conflict with State DOT policy regarding the water main in Shadyvale. She should schedule a meeting with Warren to discuss the issue openly and transparently. During the meeting, Dianne should express her commitment to following the established guidelines and policies of the State DOT, emphasizing the importance of integrity in project design and implementation.

Dianne should propose alternative solutions that align with the State DOT policy while still addressing the water main problem in Shadyvale. This could involve exploring cost-effective options or seeking additional funding sources to support the necessary upgrades to the water main. By presenting these alternatives, Dianne can demonstrate her dedication to ethical conduct and responsible decision-making.

Furthermore, Dianne should seek guidance from a supervisor or ethics committee within the organization to ensure that her actions align with the ethical standards of the State DOT. By consulting with relevant stakeholders and following the proper channels for addressing ethical dilemmas, Dianne can navigate the situation effectively and uphold the integrity of the project.
