I would schedule a meeting with Mr. Young to discuss his decision to give the scope of work to a competitor. During the meeting, I would directly inquire about the reasons behind his choice and listen attentively to his concerns. I would then propose potential solutions to address any issues raised, such as offering a revised cost estimate, providing additional value-added services, or adjusting the payment terms to align with the competitor's offer. By actively engaging in dialogue and demonstrating a willingness to accommodate the client's needs, I aim to salvage the relationship and potentially regain the project.
