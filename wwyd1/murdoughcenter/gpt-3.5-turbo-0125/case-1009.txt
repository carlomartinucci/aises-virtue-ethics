I would schedule a meeting with Mr. Young to discuss the situation further and understand the reasons behind his decision to give the scope of work to a competitor. During the meeting, I would directly inquire about any specific concerns or requirements that led to his decision. I would emphasize the unique value and expertise that my firm brings to the project, highlighting our successful track record in similar projects. Additionally, I would propose potential solutions or compromises to win back the project, such as offering additional services or adjusting the terms to better align with the client's needs. By actively engaging with the client and addressing their concerns, I aim to salvage the relationship and potentially secure the project for my firm.
