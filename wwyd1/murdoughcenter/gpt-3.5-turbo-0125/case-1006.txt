I would first review the company's policies and code of conduct to understand if there are any guidelines related to political contributions. If there are no specific policies in place, I would schedule a meeting with HR to discuss the situation and seek guidance on how to proceed ethically. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about the expectation of making political contributions in exchange for career advancement and inquire about potential alternative courses of action. Additionally, I would document the details of the meeting and any advice provided by HR for future reference.
