I would schedule a private meeting with Charlie Oxx to express my concerns about the expectation of making political contributions in exchange for career advancement. During the meeting, I would respectfully communicate that while I appreciate the opportunities provided by CWE, I am uncomfortable with the idea of contributing to the council members' campaign funds. I would emphasize my commitment to performing my job duties diligently and ethically, and express my desire to advance based on merit and professional growth rather than financial contributions.

Additionally, I would seek guidance from HR or a trusted mentor within the company to understand the potential implications of not making the contribution. I would inquire about any existing company policies or guidelines related to political contributions and conflicts of interest to ensure that my decision aligns with the organization's values.

Ultimately, I would prioritize maintaining my integrity and ethical principles while navigating this challenging situation. By addressing my concerns directly with Charlie Oxx and seeking guidance from HR, I aim to find a resolution that upholds my values and professional integrity within the company.
