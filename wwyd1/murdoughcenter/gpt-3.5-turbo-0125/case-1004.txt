I would immediately inform Fulton Adams about the observed relationship between Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert. I would recommend that Adams raise this issue with the court and request that the judge be made aware of the potential conflict of interest. Additionally, I would suggest that Adams consider seeking guidance from legal ethics experts on how to proceed in a manner that upholds the integrity of the legal proceedings. It is crucial to ensure transparency and fairness in the case, and addressing this conflict of interest is essential to maintain the credibility of the expert witnesses and the overall integrity of the trial.
