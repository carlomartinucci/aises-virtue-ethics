I would immediately inform Fulton Adams about the discovered relationship between Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert. I would stress the potential conflict of interest this poses, especially given Cleghorn's role as an expert witness in the ongoing case. I would recommend that Adams raise this issue with the court to ensure transparency and fairness in the legal proceedings. Additionally, I would suggest seeking guidance from legal ethics experts on how to address the situation appropriately and ethically. It is crucial to disclose this information to all relevant parties involved in the case to maintain the integrity of the legal process.
