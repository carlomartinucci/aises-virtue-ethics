To address the scenario effectively, Jack should take the following specific actions:

1. Contact the drilling crew and geologist immediately to schedule a meeting to discuss the discrepancies between the provided boring logs and the actual site conditions. Request detailed explanations and clarifications on the locations, depths, and procedures followed during the drilling operations.

2. Conduct a thorough review of the subsurface exploration logs and data in the presence of the drilling crew and geologist to identify any inaccuracies or missing information. Document all discrepancies and ensure that all relevant details are recorded for future reference.

3. If necessary, arrange for additional borings or tests to be conducted at the site to gather the required data for the foundation design recommendations. Coordinate with the drilling crew and geologist to ensure that the new data is collected accurately and promptly.

4. Communicate with the client about the situation, explaining the discrepancies in the data and any potential delays in the project timeline. Provide regular updates on the progress of resolving the issue and seek their understanding and cooperation in ensuring the accuracy of the design recommendations.

5. Involve senior engineers or project managers within the firm to provide additional insights and support in analyzing the data and making informed decisions regarding the foundation design recommendations. Collaborate with the team to address any challenges and work towards a comprehensive solution.

By taking these specific actions, Jack can effectively address the discrepancies in the data provided by the drilling crew and geologist, ensure the accuracy of the foundation design recommendations, and maintain transparency and professionalism in his communication with the client and internal stakeholders.
