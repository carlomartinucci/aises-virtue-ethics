After confirming the extent of plagiarism in the project reports, I would schedule individual meetings with each of the seven students who submitted identical work. During these meetings, I would present the evidence of plagiarism and give the students the opportunity to explain their actions. Based on the university's academic integrity policy, I would inform the students that they will receive a failing grade for the project and that this violation will be reported to the academic integrity office for further investigation.

In addition to the immediate consequences, I would require the students to attend a mandatory workshop on academic integrity to educate them on the importance of original work and proper citation practices. This workshop would serve as a preventive measure to ensure that the students understand the seriousness of plagiarism and how to avoid it in the future.

I would document all meetings, decisions, and actions taken in response to the plagiarism incident for my records and for potential future reference. Lastly, I would communicate the outcomes to the students in a clear and transparent manner, emphasizing the university's commitment to upholding academic integrity and fairness in grading.
