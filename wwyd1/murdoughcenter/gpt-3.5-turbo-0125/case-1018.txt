I would first gather all the identical project reports submitted by the students and carefully compare them side by side to confirm the extent of the plagiarism. Following this, I would schedule individual meetings with each of the seven students who submitted the identical reports to discuss the issue. During these meetings, I would confront the students with the evidence of plagiarism and give them the opportunity to explain themselves.

Based on the university's academic integrity policy and the severity of the offense, I would determine the appropriate consequences for each student. This may include failing the project, failing the course, or further disciplinary actions as per university guidelines. I would clearly communicate these decisions to the students and document the outcomes for record-keeping purposes.

In addition to addressing the immediate issue, I would take steps to prevent future incidents of plagiarism in the course. This could involve reinforcing the importance of academic integrity, providing resources on proper citation and research practices, and implementing regular checks for plagiarism in future assignments.

Lastly, I would report the incident to the university's academic integrity office or relevant authority for further investigation and potential disciplinary action. Seeking guidance from a trusted colleague or mentor throughout this process would also be beneficial in ensuring a fair and ethical resolution to the situation.
