Daulton should immediately schedule a meeting with Elias and Shellie to address the undisclosed ownership of the property in Walbert Township. During the meeting, he should express his concerns about the conflict of interest and emphasize the importance of transparency in all business dealings. Daulton should request that Elias and Shellie divest themselves of the property to avoid any appearance of impropriety.

Additionally, Daulton should inform Conner about the situation and instruct him to halt any negotiations related to the property acquisition until the conflict of interest is resolved. Daulton should seek legal advice to ensure that all actions taken are in compliance with ethical standards and legal requirements.

Furthermore, Daulton should document the meeting with Elias and Shellie, as well as any decisions made regarding the property ownership. He should also consider involving ClearWater Developers' legal department or an external ethics committee to provide guidance on how to proceed in a manner that upholds ethical principles and mitigates potential risks for the company.
