Roger should immediately schedule a meeting with Frank Bullock to discuss his concerns about the draft report being shared with private sector clients. During the meeting, Roger should clearly communicate his uneasiness about the potential misuse of the information and emphasize the importance of maintaining confidentiality and integrity in the project. He should request that Frank refrain from sharing the draft report with external parties and assure him that the final report will be delivered to the client as planned.

Additionally, Roger should inform his direct supervisor, Bill Mason, about the situation and seek his guidance on how to proceed. He should document the meeting with Frank and any subsequent discussions with Bill to ensure a record of the events. Moving forward, Roger should be cautious about sharing sensitive project information and seek clarification from higher management if faced with similar requests in the future.
