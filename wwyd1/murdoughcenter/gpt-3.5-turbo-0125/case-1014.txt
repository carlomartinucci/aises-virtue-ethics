In response to the scenario, Roger should immediately schedule a meeting with Frank Bullock to discuss his concerns about the draft report being shared with private sector clients. During the meeting, Roger should clearly communicate his discomfort with the situation and express the importance of maintaining confidentiality and integrity in handling sensitive project information. He should request that Frank refrain from sharing any further drafts or project details with external parties without explicit approval from the project team.

Additionally, Roger should seek guidance from a more neutral party within the organization, such as the firm's ethics or compliance officer, to ensure that proper protocols are followed and to address any potential conflicts of interest. It is crucial for Roger to document all communications and decisions made regarding the project to protect himself and uphold professional standards.

Moving forward, Roger should establish clear boundaries and communication protocols within the project team to prevent similar situations from arising in the future. By proactively addressing ethical concerns and seeking guidance from appropriate channels, Roger can uphold ethical standards and protect the integrity of the project and the firm.
