I would seek legal advice or representation before attending the mediation hearing to ensure that my firm's interests are protected and to navigate the process effectively. Legal counsel can provide guidance on how to present the technical evidence in a compelling manner and can advise on the best course of action during the mediation. Additionally, I would document all interactions and communications with the other parties involved, including any evidence supporting our position, to have a clear record of events.

During the mediation hearing, I would present the technical facts related to the pile design recommendations made by my firm in a clear and concise manner. I would emphasize that our recommendations were correct and that the issues with the pile driving were not due to any fault on our part. If pressured to contribute financially to the settlement, I would rely on the legal advice received to determine the best course of action to protect my firm's interests while maintaining integrity and professionalism.

Overall, seeking legal guidance, documenting interactions, and presenting the technical evidence effectively during the mediation hearing are concrete actions that can help navigate the situation ethically and practically.
