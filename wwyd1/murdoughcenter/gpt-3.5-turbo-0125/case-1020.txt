I would attend the mediation hearing as requested by Noall's attorney and present the technical evidence and documentation supporting my firm's position regarding the pile design recommendations. I would firmly assert that our recommendations were correct and that we are not financially responsible for the issues encountered during pile driving. I would emphasize the specific details of the faulty pipe welding and the inadequate length of the pipe ordered by Deepdown Pile, which were beyond our firm's control.

During the mediation, I would maintain a professional demeanor and focus on the technical aspects of the situation, avoiding any discussions related to financial contributions. I would stand my ground on the firm's innocence and provide a clear and detailed explanation of the evidence uncovered during the investigation. Additionally, I would document all interactions and communications during the mediation process to ensure a comprehensive record of events.

If pressured to contribute financially, I would reiterate our firm's position based on the technical evidence and maintain that we are not liable for the additional costs incurred by Deepdown Pile. I would seek to resolve the matter based on the facts and merits of the case, rather than succumbing to financial pressure.
