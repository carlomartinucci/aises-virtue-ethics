To address the concerns in the scenario, Robert should immediately schedule a meeting with Walker, Larry, and James to discuss the discrepancies in the foundation design and construction process. During the meeting, Robert should present a detailed analysis of the over-designed foundation and the potential risks associated with it. He should emphasize the importance of aligning the construction with the geotechnical recommendations to ensure the structural integrity and performance of the buildings.

Robert should propose a collaborative approach where all stakeholders work together to revise the foundation design to align with the geotechnical report. He should suggest involving a qualified structural engineer to review and modify the foundation plans accordingly. Additionally, Robert should recommend implementing quality control measures and regular monitoring during the construction phase to ensure compliance with the revised design and to address any issues promptly.

Furthermore, Robert should express his concerns about potential liabilities and the inefficient use of resources due to the over-designed foundation. He should advocate for a more cost-effective and sustainable construction approach that prioritizes structural integrity while minimizing unnecessary expenses.

By taking proactive steps to address the discrepancies and collaborate with all stakeholders involved, Robert can work towards ensuring the successful completion of the project while upholding ethical standards and professional integrity.
