Robert should immediately schedule a meeting with Walker, Larry, and any other key stakeholders involved in the project. During the meeting, he should present his findings regarding the over-designed foundation and the discrepancies between his geotechnical recommendations and the actual construction plans. Robert should emphasize the potential risks and liabilities associated with the current approach and propose a collaborative effort to rectify the situation.

In the meeting, Robert should advocate for a revised construction plan that aligns with his geotechnical recommendations while also considering cost-efficiency and structural integrity. He should work with Larry to develop a new foundation design that meets the project's requirements without unnecessary over-design. Additionally, Robert should stress the importance of quality control monitoring and testing throughout the construction process to ensure the structural stability of the buildings.

Furthermore, Robert should offer his expertise and guidance to Walker and Larry to support them in implementing the revised construction plan effectively. By fostering open communication and collaboration among all parties involved, Robert can help mitigate potential risks, improve the project's efficiency, and uphold ethical standards in engineering practice.
