Carlos should immediately address the safety concerns by implementing additional safety measures on the construction site. He should ensure that the Ecuadorian workers receive proper safety training and equipment to mitigate any risks associated with working on the concrete tank. Carlos should also seek guidance from relevant regulatory bodies to ensure compliance with safety standards.

In parallel, Carlos should initiate the process of legalizing the Ecuadorian workers to provide them with worker compensation benefits and medical insurance. He should work with the company's HR department to facilitate the necessary paperwork and procedures to legalize their employment status.

Furthermore, Carlos should communicate openly with the Ecuadorian workers about the importance of safety on the construction site and encourage them to voice any concerns they may have. Building a culture of safety and transparency will help create a safer working environment for everyone involved in the project.

Lastly, Carlos should document all safety measures implemented, training provided, and steps taken to legalize the workers' employment status. This documentation will not only ensure compliance with regulations but also demonstrate his commitment to ethical practices and worker well-being.
