To address the situation, Carlos should immediately document his concerns about the safety risks associated with using unqualified workers for the tank construction. He should schedule a meeting with his boss to discuss the potential hazards and propose a plan to hire qualified workers to ensure the project's completion in a safe and efficient manner. Carlos should emphasize the importance of prioritizing worker safety and legal compliance to avoid any potential liabilities for the company.

Additionally, Carlos should reach out to local labor unions or regulatory bodies to seek guidance on how to legalize the employment status of the Ecuadorian workers and provide them with the necessary worker compensation benefits and medical insurance. By proactively addressing these issues, Carlos can demonstrate his commitment to ethical practices and ensure the well-being of all workers involved in the project.

If his boss remains resistant to the proposed changes, Carlos should consider escalating the matter to higher management or seeking legal advice to protect the workers' rights and uphold ethical standards in the workplace. It is crucial for Carlos to stand firm on his principles and advocate for the safety and well-being of the workers, even if it means risking his chances of securing a permanent contract with the firm.
