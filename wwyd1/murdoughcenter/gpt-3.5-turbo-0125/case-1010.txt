In this scenario, Julie should immediately contact the local building authorities to report the structural issues with the Inverness Block, specifically the rusted clip angles that pose a serious risk of the granite veneer blocks becoming dislodged and potentially causing harm to pedestrians below. This action is crucial to ensure public safety and uphold professional integrity.

Furthermore, Julie should inform her client, Charles Smith, in writing about the structural concerns and the potential risks associated with the building. She should clearly outline the findings from the structural survey conducted by Brock and emphasize the importance of addressing the safety issues before proceeding with any further work on the building.

Additionally, Julie should seek legal advice to understand her obligations and potential liabilities in this situation. Consulting with legal experts will help her navigate the complex legal implications of the structural issues and ensure that she is taking the appropriate steps to protect both public safety and her professional reputation.

By taking these specific actions, Julie can demonstrate her commitment to ethical standards, public safety, and professional integrity. It is essential to prioritize safety and transparency in addressing structural concerns, even if it means risking the business relationship with the client.
