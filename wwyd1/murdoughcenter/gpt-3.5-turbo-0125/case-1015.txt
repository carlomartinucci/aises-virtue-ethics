I would schedule a meeting with the contractor and other key stakeholders to discuss the foundation design recommendations in person. During the meeting, I would present a detailed analysis of the geotechnical conditions at the site, emphasizing the potential risks associated with using shallow footings instead of piles. I would use visual aids such as charts, graphs, and case studies to illustrate the long-term settlement issues that could arise.

I would address the contractor's concerns about the warranty period by proposing a compromise solution. I would suggest incorporating a monitoring program during the first year after construction to track any settlement issues that may arise. This monitoring program would provide real-time data on the performance of the foundations and allow for early detection of any potential problems.

If the contractor continues to push for shallow footings despite the evidence presented, I would document all communication and decisions made regarding the foundation design. I would also seek guidance from the project manager or legal counsel on how to proceed while upholding my professional integrity and ethical responsibilities as a geotechnical engineer.

By taking a collaborative approach, providing evidence-based recommendations, and proposing a monitoring program, I aim to find a solution that balances the contractor's concerns with the long-term structural integrity of the buildings.
