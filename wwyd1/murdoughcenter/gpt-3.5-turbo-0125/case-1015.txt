I would schedule a meeting with the contractor and other key stakeholders to discuss the foundation design recommendations in person. During the meeting, I would present a detailed analysis of the potential risks associated with using shallow footings instead of piles based on the site-specific conditions and soil characteristics. I would emphasize the importance of prioritizing the long-term structural integrity and safety of the buildings to ensure the well-being of future occupants.

I would offer to provide additional evidence, such as case studies or geotechnical reports from similar projects, to support my recommendations and demonstrate the potential consequences of settling for a suboptimal foundation design. I would encourage an open dialogue to address any concerns or questions raised by the contractor and seek to find a mutually agreeable solution that aligns with the project's long-term goals and objectives.

If the contractor continues to insist on using shallow footings despite the risks identified, I would document the discussions and decisions made during the meeting in writing, including the potential implications of deviating from the recommended foundation design. I would ensure that all parties involved are aware of the risks and consequences associated with the chosen approach and maintain transparency throughout the decision-making process.

Ultimately, my priority would be to uphold the highest standards of professional ethics and integrity in my role as a geotechnical engineer, while also working collaboratively with the design-build team to reach a consensus that prioritizes the safety and durability of the structures for the benefit of all stakeholders involved in the project.
