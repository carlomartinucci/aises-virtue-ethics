I would first gather all the documentation related to the sampling of the drums, including notes, chain-of-custody records, and communication with Chuck. Then, I would schedule a meeting with Chuck to discuss the discrepancy between the information provided to me and the actions taken by the remediation contractor. During the meeting, I would present the evidence and express my concerns about the potential misrepresentation of the sampling results to the client.

I would suggest to Chuck that we immediately conduct proper testing of the drum contents to ensure accurate information is provided to the client and regulatory authorities. If Chuck is unwilling to address the issue or dismisses my concerns, I would escalate the matter to higher management within Everclere Consultants, Inc. to ensure that ethical standards are upheld and that the situation is rectified appropriately.
