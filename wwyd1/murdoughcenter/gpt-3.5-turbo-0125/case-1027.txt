In the morning, I would have a candid conversation with Bill Broot about the cost estimate for the new project site. I would start by acknowledging the budget overrun on the Dawson project and take responsibility for not staying within the agreed-upon contract amount. I would explain the factors that led to the overrun and outline steps we will take to prevent similar situations in the future, such as implementing tighter project controls and regular budget monitoring.

Regarding the new project site, I would inform Bill that the estimated cost for the design work, considering the reuse of information and analyses from the Dawson site, would be $22,800. I would provide a detailed breakdown of how this cost was calculated and emphasize the cost-saving benefits of leveraging existing data and analyses. Additionally, I would propose a revised contract that includes clear terms and conditions to ensure both parties are aligned on the scope of work, deliverables, and budget constraints.

By addressing the past budget overrun, demonstrating accountability, and proposing a proactive approach to financial management for the new project, I aim to rebuild trust with Bill and strengthen our working relationship. This approach prioritizes transparency, accountability, and effective communication to ensure successful project outcomes and sustainable business practices.
