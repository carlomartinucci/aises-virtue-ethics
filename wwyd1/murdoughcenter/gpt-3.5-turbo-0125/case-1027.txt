In the morning, I would have an open and honest conversation with Bill Broot about the cost estimate for the new project site. I would inform him that the estimated cost for the design work on the new project site, leveraging information and analyses from the Dawson site, would be $22,800. Additionally, I would address the budget overrun on the Dawson project by taking responsibility for the oversight and discussing potential solutions to prevent similar occurrences in the future.

To ensure financial accountability and sustainability within our firm, I would propose implementing stricter budget monitoring processes, conducting regular budget reviews with the project team, and seeking approval for any additional work that may impact the project budget. By proactively addressing the past budget overrun and outlining concrete steps to improve financial management practices, I aim to demonstrate our commitment to delivering high-quality services within budget constraints and fostering a trusting relationship with our clients like Bill Broot.
