I would immediately reach out to the University President and the Vice President for Finance to schedule a meeting to discuss the potential conflicts of interest involving Shreud Contractors, Gus Olson, Ray Vandergrafft, and Fred Facade. During the meeting, I would present the specific details provided by Alice and Ted, highlighting the connections between the construction projects and the individuals involved.

I would recommend conducting a thorough review of the contracting processes at the university to ensure transparency and fairness. I would propose implementing stricter oversight mechanisms to prevent any future conflicts of interest and to uphold the integrity of the construction projects.

Additionally, I would offer to assist in establishing clear guidelines and protocols for selecting contractors and managing construction projects to mitigate the risk of favoritism or unethical practices. I would emphasize the importance of maintaining a level playing field for all contractors and ensuring that projects are awarded based on merit and compliance with ethical standards.

Following the meeting, I would follow up with the University President and the Vice President for Finance to inquire about any actions taken in response to the concerns raised. I would express my willingness to support any further investigations or audits that may be necessary to address the issues and uphold ethical practices in the university's construction projects.
