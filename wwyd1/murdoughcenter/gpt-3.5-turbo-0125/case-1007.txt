I would immediately document all the information shared by Alice and Ted regarding the potential conflicts of interest involving Shreud Contractors, Gus Olson, Ray Vandergrafft, and Fred Facade. I would then discreetly reach out to the University President, whom I have a personal relationship with, to express my concerns about the situation.

During this conversation, I would emphasize the importance of maintaining transparency and fairness in all construction projects at the university. I would suggest conducting an internal review of the contracting processes to ensure that they are free from any conflicts of interest or favoritism.

Additionally, I would offer to provide any assistance needed in further investigating the matter, such as reviewing project documentation or providing insights based on my architectural expertise. I would also recommend implementing stricter oversight measures to prevent similar conflicts of interest from arising in the future.

Following the initial discussion, I would follow up with the University President to inquire about any actions taken in response to the information provided. I would continue to monitor the situation closely and offer ongoing support in promoting ethical practices in the university's construction projects.

By taking these specific steps, I aim to address the potential conflicts of interest in a direct and practical manner while upholding ethical standards and integrity in the university's construction processes.
