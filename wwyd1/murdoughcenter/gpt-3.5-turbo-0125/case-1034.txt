To address the conflict of interest situation involving Arthur and David:

1. Arthur and David should immediately disclose the potential conflict of interest to the Fairview CSC, the major design firm, and any other relevant parties involved in the project. They should provide a detailed explanation of their roles and potential influence to ensure transparency.

2. Seek guidance from an independent ethics advisor or legal counsel to assess the situation objectively and determine the best course of action. This step will help them understand the ethical implications and potential consequences of their involvement in the project.

3. Consider recusing themselves from any decision-making processes related to the project, including the awarding of contracts. By stepping back from these responsibilities, they can demonstrate a commitment to ethical behavior and avoid any perception of impropriety.

4. Engage in direct and open communication with Monroe to address his concerns and clarify their intentions regarding the project. By addressing his objections respectfully and transparently, they can work towards resolving the conflict and maintaining professional relationships.

5. Collaborate with the Fairview CSC and other stakeholders to establish clear guidelines and protocols for handling conflicts of interest in future projects. By implementing robust procedures to identify and address conflicts early on, they can prevent similar ethical dilemmas from arising in the future.
