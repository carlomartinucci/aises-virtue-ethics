1. They should immediately disclose the potential conflict of interest to the Fairview CSC, the major design firm, and any other relevant parties involved in the project.

2. Arthur and David should recuse themselves from any decision-making processes related to the awarding of contracts for the project to avoid any perception of bias.

3. They should engage in a direct and transparent conversation with Monroe to address his concerns and clarify their commitment to ethical behavior and professional integrity.

4. Arthur and David should seek an independent ethics review or consultation to ensure that their actions align with ethical standards and to receive guidance on navigating the conflict of interest situation effectively.

5. They should work with the Fairview CSC and other stakeholders to establish clear guidelines and protocols for handling conflicts of interest in future projects, promoting transparency and accountability in their community involvement.
