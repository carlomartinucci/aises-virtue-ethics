Rod should discreetly document the instances of foremen putting gifts in the resident engineer's pickup truck. He should then report this information to his supervisor, Jim Upwright, as soon as possible. In addition, Rod should seek guidance from an ethics advisor at his university or the DOT headquarters on how to handle the situation effectively. Consulting with colleagues to gather more perspectives and potentially uncover any underlying reasons for the gifts being exchanged would also be beneficial. By taking these steps, Rod can ensure a thorough and comprehensive resolution to the ethical dilemma at hand.
