I would respectfully decline the offer from Mr. Owatadeel and International Affiliates Ltd. Instead, I would conduct further research to identify reputable and ethical local firms in Utopia that can assist in representing Choice Engineering's interests. I would leverage my network and seek recommendations from trusted sources to find a suitable local partner with a track record of integrity and transparency.

Once a potential local partner is identified, I would initiate discussions to establish a partnership based on mutual respect and ethical business practices. I would prioritize transparency in all dealings and ensure that the partnership aligns with Choice Engineering's values and standards. By taking the time to carefully select a trustworthy local firm, we can mitigate the risks associated with engaging in corrupt practices and uphold our commitment to ethical conduct in all business dealings.
