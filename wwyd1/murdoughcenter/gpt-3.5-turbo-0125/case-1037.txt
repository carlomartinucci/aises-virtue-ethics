I would advise Fulton Adams to discuss the discovery of Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert's personal relationship with the legal team representing Wastewater Treatment Systems. This information could potentially be used to challenge Cleghorn's credibility during the trial, especially if it can be argued that his personal relationship with the plaintiff's attorney may have influenced his testimony. It may be strategic to bring this up during cross-examination to cast doubt on the objectivity of Cleghorn's expert opinions. Additionally, I would recommend seeking legal counsel on how best to leverage this information within the confines of the legal system to ensure that any actions taken are in compliance with legal standards and do not compromise the defendant's case.
