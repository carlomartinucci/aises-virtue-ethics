I would immediately inform Fulton Adams about the discovery of Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert's personal relationship and living situation. I would recommend that Adams discuss this information with the legal team representing Wastewater Treatment Systems to strategize on how to address this potential conflict of interest during the trial. This could involve raising the issue as a point of contention, questioning Cleghorn's credibility during cross-examination, or potentially filing a motion to challenge Cleghorn's role as an expert witness due to the conflict of interest. Seeking legal counsel on the best course of action would be crucial to ensure that any steps taken are in compliance with legal standards and do not compromise the defendant's case.
