Bert should immediately gather the original drawings from his previous job at County Line Design and any relevant documentation related to the subcontracting work between County Line Design and Far Horizons Engineering. He should then schedule a meeting with a senior manager at Far Horizons to discuss his concerns about the unauthorized use of the drawings. During the meeting, Bert should present the evidence he has collected and clearly explain the situation, emphasizing the potential ethical and legal implications of using the drawings without proper authorization. Bert should propose conducting an internal investigation to determine the origin of the drawings and ensure that any unauthorized use is rectified. If necessary, Bert should also consider involving legal counsel to protect the intellectual property rights of his former firm and uphold professional standards.
