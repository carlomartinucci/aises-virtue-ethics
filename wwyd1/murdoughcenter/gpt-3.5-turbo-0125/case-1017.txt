Bert should first gather all the original drawings and any relevant documentation from his previous job at County Line Design. He should then schedule a meeting with his immediate supervisor at Far Horizons Engineering to discuss his concerns about the unauthorized use of the drawings. During the meeting, Bert should present the evidence he has collected and clearly explain the situation, emphasizing the potential ethical and legal implications of using the drawings without proper authorization.

Bert should suggest conducting an internal investigation to determine the origin of the drawings and whether there was any breach of intellectual property rights. He should also propose taking immediate action to rectify the situation, such as ceasing the use of the drawings in question and reaching out to County Line Design to address the issue and seek permission for any future use of their work.

Additionally, Bert should document all communication and actions taken regarding the situation to ensure transparency and accountability. By taking these specific steps, Bert can demonstrate his commitment to upholding professional standards and ethical practices while addressing the unauthorized use of the drawings in a practical and responsible manner.
