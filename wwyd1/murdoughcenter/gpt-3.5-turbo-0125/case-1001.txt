To address the formal complaint filed by I. B. Stout against Jonathan Turnbuckle for practicing as an engineer without a license in the state during the clock tower remediation project, Turnbuckle should take the following specific actions:

1. Compile a comprehensive portfolio: Gather all relevant documentation related to the project, including engineering designs, correspondence with stakeholders, project reports, and any permits or licenses held in other states.

2. Seek legal counsel: Consult with a lawyer specializing in engineering regulations in the state to understand the specific legal requirements and implications of practicing without a license.

3. Respond to the complaint: Craft a detailed response to Stout's complaint, outlining Turnbuckle's qualifications, experience, and the circumstances of his involvement in the project. Provide evidence of professional engineering registrations in other states and emphasize the successful outcome of the remediation project.

4. Cooperate with the state board: Fully cooperate with the state Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors. Provide any additional information or documentation required for their review of the case.

5. Prepare a defense strategy: Work with legal counsel to develop a strong defense strategy that highlights Turnbuckle's expertise, adherence to professional standards, and commitment to resolving the structural issues with the clock tower.

6. Demonstrate commitment to compliance: Express willingness to comply with any disciplinary measures or corrective actions deemed necessary by the board to address the issue of practicing without a license in the state.

By taking these specific actions, Turnbuckle can effectively address the complaint, present a robust defense of his actions, and work towards resolving the issue in a professional and ethical manner.
