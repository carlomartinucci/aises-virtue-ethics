I would schedule a meeting with the Vice President for Operations to discuss the situation regarding the billing practices for the Excaliber and Wellfleet projects. During the meeting, I would present a detailed analysis of the budget discrepancies, outlining the potential risks associated with overcharging one project to cover the budget shortfall of another. I would propose reallocating resources from other projects or renegotiating the budget for the Wellfleet project to ensure that both projects are completed successfully and within budget.

Additionally, I would suggest implementing a more transparent and fair billing system for future projects to avoid similar issues. By addressing the problem directly with the Vice President and offering practical solutions, I aim to uphold ethical standards, maintain client trust, and protect the firm's reputation.
