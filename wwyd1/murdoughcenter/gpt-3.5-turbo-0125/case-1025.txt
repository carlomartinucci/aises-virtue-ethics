In addition to declining the settlement offer from the adjacent property owner and continuing to work with my lawyer to present evidence of our firm's lack of responsibility, I would also take the following specific actions:

1. Contact the bank and the building contractor to discuss their failure to obtain permission for the tiebacks and anchors on the adjacent property. Emphasize the importance of following proper procedures and obtaining necessary approvals in future projects to avoid legal complications.

By addressing the unethical actions of the bank and the contractor directly, we can work towards preventing similar oversights in the future and holding responsible parties accountable for their actions. This proactive approach will help ensure that all parties involved in construction projects understand and adhere to legal and ethical requirements.
