In response to the scenario, I would first consult with my lawyer to discuss the possibility of taking legal action against the bank, the contractor, and the adjacent property owner for their failure to obtain permission for the tiebacks and anchors. This would involve exploring options for holding these parties accountable for their actions that led to the legal issues faced by my firm.

Additionally, I would review and revise our internal protocols and procedures to ensure that similar oversights do not occur in future projects. This may involve implementing stricter checks and balances to verify that all necessary permissions and agreements are in place before proceeding with any construction activities that may impact neighboring properties.

Furthermore, I would consider engaging in mediation or negotiation with the adjacent property owner to reach a resolution that is fair and reasonable for all parties involved. This could involve discussing the possibility of de-stressing and abandoning the tiebacks as originally planned, as well as addressing any concerns or damages caused by the encroachment on the adjacent property.

Overall, by taking legal action against the responsible parties, reviewing and enhancing internal protocols, and engaging in constructive dialogue with the adjacent property owner, I aim to address the ethical and practical implications of the situation while safeguarding the reputation and integrity of my firm.
