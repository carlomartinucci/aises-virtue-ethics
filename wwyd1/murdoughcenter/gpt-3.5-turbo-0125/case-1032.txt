I would recommend Topher to organize a community meeting to discuss the potential impacts of the Windsor Ridge development on the poorer families living south of the area. By bringing together residents, local leaders, and representatives from the development team, Topher can facilitate an open dialogue about the concerns and considerations surrounding the project. This forum would allow for a transparent exchange of information and perspectives, enabling all parties to voice their opinions and collaborate on finding solutions that prioritize the well-being of the entire community.

During the meeting, Topher should ensure that the concerns of the impacted families are heard and taken into account by the development team. By fostering a collaborative approach, Topher can work towards finding a mutually beneficial outcome that addresses the needs of both the existing residents and the proposed development. Additionally, he should encourage the design engineers to explore alternative design options that minimize the negative impacts on the downstream community while still meeting regulatory requirements.

By actively involving the community in the decision-making process and advocating for their interests, Topher can demonstrate his commitment to ethical leadership and responsible governance. This approach not only promotes transparency and inclusivity but also empowers residents to have a voice in shaping the future of their community.
