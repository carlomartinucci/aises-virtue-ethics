To address the concerns raised in the critique and provide a more practical and ethically sound response to the scenario, Topher should take the following specific actions:

1. Schedule a meeting with the design engineers and the developers of the Windsor Ridge project to discuss the potential adverse impacts on the poorer families living south of the development. During the meeting, Topher should present his insights and observations regarding the secondary impacts on the community downstream, emphasizing the importance of considering the well-being of all residents of Plebian.

By directly engaging with the key stakeholders involved in the development project, Topher can raise awareness about the potential negative consequences and advocate for alternative solutions that could mitigate the impacts on the impacted community. This proactive approach allows Topher to address the issue at its source and work towards finding a more balanced and equitable solution for all residents of Plebian.

Taking concrete steps to communicate his concerns and collaborate with the developers demonstrates Topher's commitment to ethical decision-making and his responsibility as the City Engineer to prioritize the welfare of the community. By actively engaging with the stakeholders and advocating for the impacted residents, Topher can work towards a more inclusive and considerate development plan that takes into account the needs and concerns of all members of the community.
