In this situation, as one of the engineers in the Gamma Group Omaha office, I would first reach out to the remaining team members to discuss our options and assess the impact of Ralph and Dorph's departure on our projects and client relationships. I would suggest organizing a meeting with the management at Gamma Group to express our concerns and seek clarity on the future plans for the office.

To address the sudden loss of key team members, I would propose creating a transition plan to ensure continuity in project delivery and client management. This plan could involve redistributing responsibilities among the existing team members, identifying potential replacements for Ralph and Dorph, and establishing a strategy to retain current clients and attract new business.

Furthermore, I would encourage open communication within the team to address any uncertainties or anxieties resulting from the departures. It is essential to support each other during this transition period and work collaboratively to maintain the office's productivity and reputation.

Overall, my approach would focus on proactive communication, strategic planning, and team collaboration to navigate the challenges posed by Ralph and Dorph's sudden departure and ensure the continued success of the Gamma Group Omaha office.
