I would thank John Bigge for considering me for the final engineering design of the project. I would express my appreciation for his confidence in my abilities and reputation in the community. I would then ask for more details about the specific concerns and issues raised by Weeks and Weeks in their preliminary report, so that I can better understand the project requirements and potential challenges. I would also inquire about the timeline for the project and any other important considerations that need to be addressed. Finally, I would confirm my interest in working on the project and express my commitment to providing high-quality engineering services to ensure the success of the development.
