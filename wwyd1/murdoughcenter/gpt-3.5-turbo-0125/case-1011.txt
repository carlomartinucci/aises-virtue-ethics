I would thank John Bigge for reaching out to me regarding the final engineering design for the project. I would express my interest in collaborating and ensuring the success of the development. To address the concerns raised by the competitor, Weeks and Weeks, I would request a meeting with John to discuss the specific issues highlighted in their preliminary report. This would allow me to gain a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and recommendations made by the competitor. Additionally, I would propose conducting a thorough site visit to assess the conditions firsthand and gather relevant data for the final engineering design. By taking these steps, I aim to demonstrate my commitment to delivering high-quality and tailored engineering solutions for the project.
