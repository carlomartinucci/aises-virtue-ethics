I would immediately schedule a meeting with Moover Design Consultants to discuss the lack of communication and the discrepancy in our involvement in the project. During the meeting, I would clearly outline our expectations for collaboration and seek clarification on their intentions moving forward. I would request a detailed breakdown of the work allocation and timeline to ensure that our firm's expertise is being utilized effectively.

If the meeting with Moover Design Consultants does not result in a satisfactory resolution, I would consider reaching out to the agency funding the project to express our concerns and seek their intervention in ensuring fair treatment and adherence to the initial agreement. Additionally, I would consult with our legal team to explore any potential legal remedies available to us in case the situation escalates.

It is crucial to protect our firm's interests and ensure that we are valued as a subconsultant in the project. By addressing the issue directly with Moover Design Consultants and exploring all available options for resolution, we can work towards a mutually beneficial outcome while upholding ethical standards and professional integrity.
