In addition to the steps outlined in the initial response, I would proactively reach out to the agency funding the project to express our concerns about the lack of communication and potential issues with Moover Design Consultants. I would request a meeting with the agency to discuss our role in the project, the level of collaboration with Moover, and ensure that our firm's expertise is being utilized effectively.

During the meeting with the agency, I would present any relevant documentation, such as the initial agreement with Moover and our scope of work, to support our position. I would emphasize our firm's commitment to the project and our desire to ensure its successful completion while maintaining transparency and integrity in our working relationships.

By involving the agency funding the project, we can seek their support in addressing the communication and collaboration issues with Moover Design Consultants. This approach not only demonstrates our firm's professionalism and dedication to the project but also ensures that all parties involved are aware of the situation and can work together towards a resolution that is fair and beneficial for all stakeholders.
