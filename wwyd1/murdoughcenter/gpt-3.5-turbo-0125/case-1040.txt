Ethan should immediately schedule a meeting with Marc to discuss the field changes that have been authorized. During the meeting, Ethan should present a detailed analysis of the specific substitutions made by Marc and express his concerns about the potential impact on the project's quality and compliance with specifications. Ethan should propose a joint review of the field changes to ensure alignment with project requirements.

If Marc is unwilling to address the concerns or if there is a disagreement on the quality of the substitutions, Ethan should involve a neutral third party, such as a project mediator or a representative from EDOT, to facilitate a resolution. This step will help ensure that the project maintains its integrity and meets the client's expectations.

Additionally, Ethan should review the partnership agreement to identify any clauses related to design conflicts and dispute resolution mechanisms. If necessary, Ethan should seek legal counsel to understand his rights and obligations within the partnership and ensure that the project proceeds in a manner that upholds professional standards and ethical practices.

By taking proactive steps to address the field changes, involve a neutral third party if needed, and seek legal guidance, Ethan can navigate the situation ethically and protect the project's quality and reputation.
