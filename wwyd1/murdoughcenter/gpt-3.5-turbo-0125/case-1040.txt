In response to the scenario, Ethan should schedule a meeting with Marc to discuss the field changes that have been authorized. During the meeting, Ethan should present a detailed analysis of the impact of the substitutions on the project's quality and compliance with specifications. He should propose a joint review of the changes to ensure alignment with the project requirements.

Additionally, Ethan should consult the partnership agreement to understand the process for addressing design conflicts and seek legal advice if necessary to ensure compliance with contractual obligations. If the agreement does not explicitly cover such situations, Ethan should propose an amendment to include a mechanism for resolving design conflicts in a fair and transparent manner.

Furthermore, Ethan should document all discussions and decisions related to the field changes and maintain clear communication with both Marc and EDOT throughout the process. By prioritizing transparency, collaboration, and adherence to quality standards, Ethan can navigate the situation ethically and uphold the trust of the client while safeguarding the project's integrity.
