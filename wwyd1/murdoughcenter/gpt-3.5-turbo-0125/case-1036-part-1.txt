I would advise Sam to convene a meeting with all key employees, including Cal, Max, and Mrs. Sliderule, to openly discuss the challenges facing In-Line Engineering. During this meeting, Sam should encourage a collaborative approach to problem-solving and seek input from each team member on potential solutions.

One specific action Sam could take is to explore the possibility of renegotiating contracts with existing clients to secure more favorable terms or payment schedules. By engaging with clients transparently and proactively, Sam may be able to alleviate some of the financial strain on the business without resorting to deceptive practices.

Additionally, Sam should consider reaching out to local business development organizations or industry associations for potential partnerships or support programs that could provide financial assistance or resources to help stabilize the company's operations.

By involving key employees in the decision-making process and exploring alternative solutions that prioritize transparency and integrity, Sam can work towards safeguarding the future of In-Line Engineering while upholding ethical standards and maintaining the trust of clients and employees.
