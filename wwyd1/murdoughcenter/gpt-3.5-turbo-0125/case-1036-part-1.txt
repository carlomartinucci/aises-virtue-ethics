Sam should immediately schedule a meeting with all key employees, including Cal, Max, and Mrs. Sliderule, to discuss the current situation and the proposed transition plan. During this meeting, Sam should encourage open dialogue and brainstorming for alternative solutions to save the business without compromising ethics.

One specific action Sam should take is to initiate a thorough financial review of the company with the help of a financial advisor. This review should aim to identify areas of inefficiency, potential cost-cutting measures, and opportunities for increasing revenue. By involving the key employees in this process, Sam can leverage their expertise and insights to develop a strategic plan for improving the financial health of In-Line Engineering.

Additionally, Sam should explore the possibility of seeking external financing or partnerships to inject capital into the business and stabilize its operations. This could involve reaching out to banks, investors, or industry partners for potential funding or collaboration opportunities.

By taking proactive steps to address the financial challenges facing the company in a transparent and collaborative manner, Sam can work towards a sustainable solution that preserves the integrity of In-Line Engineering and secures the livelihoods of its employees.
