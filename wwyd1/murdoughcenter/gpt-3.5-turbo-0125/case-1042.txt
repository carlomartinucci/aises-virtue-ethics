Rashid should immediately document his observations regarding the inaccessible steel beams and the potential oversight in the coating procedure. He should take detailed notes and photographs to support his findings. Rashid should then schedule a meeting with Riley to discuss his concerns. During the meeting, Rashid should present the evidence he has gathered and express his worries about the quality of work and its implications for public safety.

In the meeting with Riley, Rashid should propose a solution to address the issue without causing significant delays to the project. He could suggest bringing in additional resources or finding alternative ways to ensure that the coating is applied correctly to the inaccessible areas. Rashid should emphasize the importance of upholding safety standards and meeting project specifications.

If Riley dismisses his concerns, Rashid should consider escalating the issue to higher management or the appropriate regulatory authorities. It is crucial for Rashid to prioritize public safety and quality standards over potential conflicts with his superiors. By taking proactive steps to address the problem and advocating for the integrity of the construction project, Rashid can demonstrate his commitment to ethical conduct and professional responsibility.
