In response to the scenario, I would advise Rashid to first gather concrete evidence of the issue by taking detailed photographs and notes of the steel beams that are inaccessible for the coating procedure. This evidence will be crucial in supporting his concerns and presenting a clear case to his boss, Riley. 

Next, Rashid should schedule a private meeting with Riley to discuss the quality concern. During the meeting, Rashid should present the evidence he has gathered and explain the potential risks associated with the compromised coating of the steel beams. He should emphasize the importance of upholding safety standards and the long-term implications of overlooking quality in the construction process.

If Riley remains dismissive of the issue, Rashid should consider escalating the matter to higher management or the company's quality control department. By seeking support from other stakeholders within the organization, Rashid can demonstrate his commitment to ethical standards and public safety while also ensuring that the project progresses smoothly.

Throughout this process, Rashid should maintain a professional and respectful demeanor, focusing on the facts and the potential impact on the project rather than personal opinions. By taking a proactive approach and involving relevant parties, Rashid can address the quality concern effectively while also navigating any potential challenges or pushback from his superiors.
