To address the situation regarding the pump failures at the treatment plant in Elm Grove, I would take the following steps:

1. **Engage an Independent Pump Expert**: I would hire an independent pump expert to conduct a thorough assessment of the pump failures and determine the root cause of the recurring issues. This expert would provide an unbiased analysis of both the Excelsior and Pumpco pumps to identify any design flaws, maintenance issues, or other factors contributing to the failures.

2. **Facilitate a Meeting with All Stakeholders**: I would organize a meeting with the city's project manager, Dee Taylor, the project engineer, Florence Moore, the independent pump expert, and myself to discuss the findings of the assessment. During this meeting, we would review the advantages of the Excelsior pumps, the reasons for switching to Pumpco, and the performance of both pump systems in the treatment plant.

3. **Develop a Corrective Action Plan**: Based on the assessment results and stakeholder discussions, we would collaboratively develop a corrective action plan to address the pump failures. This plan may include implementing necessary repairs or upgrades to the existing pumps, considering a switch back to Excelsior pumps if deemed more reliable, or exploring alternative pump solutions that meet the city's needs.

4. **Communicate Transparently with the Elm Grove Gazette**: I would prepare a statement for the Elm Grove Gazette that outlines the steps taken to investigate the pump failures, the involvement of the independent pump expert, and the proposed corrective action plan. This statement would emphasize our commitment to resolving the issue promptly and ensuring the long-term functionality of the treatment plant.

By engaging an independent expert, involving all stakeholders in the decision-making process, developing a comprehensive corrective action plan, and communicating transparently with the media, we can address the pump failures ethically, practically, and effectively.
