I would schedule a meeting with the city's project manager, Dee Taylor, to discuss the recent pump failures at the treatment plant in Elm Grove. During the meeting, I would propose conducting an independent assessment of the pump failures by hiring a third-party expert in pump systems. This expert would evaluate the root causes of the failures and provide recommendations for addressing the issue effectively.

Additionally, I would suggest convening a joint meeting with Dee Taylor, the project engineer Florence Moore, and the third-party expert to review the assessment findings and discuss potential solutions. This collaborative approach would ensure that all stakeholders are involved in the decision-making process and that the best course of action is determined based on expert analysis.

Furthermore, I would work with the third-party expert to prepare a comprehensive report detailing the assessment results, recommended actions, and a plan for implementing the necessary changes to prevent future pump failures. This report would be shared with the city council, the public works engineer, and other relevant parties to ensure transparency and accountability in addressing the issue.

Overall, by engaging an independent expert, involving key stakeholders in the decision-making process, and providing a detailed assessment report, we can take a proactive and ethical approach to resolving the pump failures at the treatment plant in Elm Grove.
