I would schedule a meeting with the president of Global Engineering and Construction to discuss my concerns about the potential conflict of interest involving Roy and Hotspark Electrical. During the meeting, I would present the observations I have made regarding Roy's interactions with the young woman who is the general manager of Hotspark Electrical. I would also express my worries about the possibility of preferential treatment being given to Hotspark at the expense of the firm's interests.

I would seek guidance from the president on how to address the situation effectively, considering Roy's seniority and the potential impact on ongoing projects. Based on the president's advice, I would then take appropriate action, which may include implementing closer monitoring of the projects involving Hotspark, seeking additional evidence of any preferential treatment, or potentially reassigning responsibilities within the branch office to mitigate the risk of conflicts of interest.
