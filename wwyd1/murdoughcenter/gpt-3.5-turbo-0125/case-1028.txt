To address the issue of long distance telephone charges and overhead costs, I would take the following steps:

1. Negotiate with clients: I would have open and transparent discussions with clients about the overhead costs associated with long distance telephone charges. I would explain the impact of these costs on the firm's financial health and propose a fair and reasonable way to share these expenses. This could involve negotiating a percentage markup on the actual costs to cover overhead expenses while ensuring transparency in billing.

By engaging in honest and collaborative communication with clients, we can work towards a mutually beneficial solution that takes into account both the client's expectations and the firm's financial sustainability.

This approach balances the need for transparency with the practical consideration of maintaining the firm's financial viability, ensuring ethical billing practices while also safeguarding the firm's long-term success.
