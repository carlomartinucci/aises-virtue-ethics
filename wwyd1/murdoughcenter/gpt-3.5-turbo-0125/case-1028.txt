I would consider negotiating with clients to cover a portion of the overhead costs associated with long distance telephone charges. By having an open discussion with clients about the financial implications of these expenses and proposing a fair and reasonable sharing of costs, we can ensure transparency while also maintaining the financial sustainability of the consulting firm. This approach allows for a more balanced and mutually beneficial arrangement that takes into account both the client's perspective and the firm's operational needs.
