Question 1:
To determine my fee for assisting Zeller Construction Inc., I would first assess the scope and complexity of the project, considering the level of expertise and resources required. I would then research market rates for similar services in the local area to ensure that my fee is competitive and fair. Additionally, I would discuss with Zeller Construction Inc. the value that my solution would bring to their project and negotiate a fee that reflects this value while maintaining transparency in the fee negotiation process.

Question 2:
If contacted by Hartwell Construction to participate in the project, I would evaluate the project requirements and the potential benefits of my expertise to Hartwell. I would consider the successful collaboration history with Hartwell and the value of my solution in determining the fee. I would also ensure that the fee negotiation process is transparent and that all parties are aware of the fee structure and rationale behind it to maintain ethical standards in the business relationship.

Question 3:
If I find out that Hartwell has decided not to bid on the project, my approach to determining the fee for assisting Zeller Construction Inc. would remain consistent. I would continue to assess the project scope, expertise required, and market rates to negotiate a fair fee that aligns with the value of my services to Zeller Construction Inc. Transparency in fee negotiations would still be a priority to uphold ethical standards in the business engagement.
