Improved Answer:

Question 1:
If I accept the assignment from Zeller, I would determine my fee by conducting a thorough analysis of the project requirements, including the complexity of the construction problem, the level of expertise needed, and the potential value my solution would bring to Zeller Construction Inc. I would also research market rates for similar services in the local area to ensure that my fee is competitive and fair. Additionally, I would provide a detailed breakdown of the fee structure to Zeller, outlining the rationale behind the pricing to promote transparency and ethical business practices.

Question 2:
If contacted by Hartwell to participate in the project, I would assess the fee based on the past successful collaboration, the value of my expertise in solving the construction problem, and the potential benefits to Hartwell Construction. I would engage in open communication with Hartwell to discuss the fee structure, taking into account the previous project's fee arrangement as a reference point. By maintaining transparency and fairness in fee negotiations, I aim to uphold ethical standards and foster a positive working relationship with Hartwell.

Question 3:
In the event that Hartwell decides not to bid on the project, my approach to determining the fee for Zeller Construction Inc. would remain consistent. I would continue to evaluate the project requirements, expertise needed, and market rates to establish a fair fee for my services. By adhering to a systematic and transparent fee-setting process, I aim to ensure ethical conduct and demonstrate integrity in my business dealings with both Zeller and Hartwell.
