Question 1:
As the President of Nearby Engineers, I would decline to submit an additional proposal for the project, respecting the initial selection of Trueheart Engineers by the Public Works staff. I would communicate our decision clearly to the County Public Works Department, emphasizing our commitment to ethical business practices and the importance of upholding the integrity of the selection process.

Question 2:
As a professional engineer on the County Public Works Department staff and a member of the interview/selection team, I would document the discrepancies between the announced QBS selection process and the Director of Public Works' decision to hire Nearby Engineers. I would raise my concerns with the department's ethics committee or relevant authorities, highlighting the importance of maintaining transparency and fairness in consultant selection processes.

Question 3:
As the Director of Public Works, upon receiving instructions to hire Nearby Engineers regardless of the established selection process, I would request a meeting with the Board of Supervisors to discuss the situation. I would present the facts surrounding the selection process, emphasizing the importance of adhering to ethical standards and fair practices in procurement. If necessary, I would seek guidance from legal counsel to ensure compliance with regulations and ethical guidelines.

Question 4:
As the President of Trueheart Engineers, after the contract approval was delayed and Nearby Engineers were selected instead, I would request a debriefing meeting with the County Public Works Department to understand the reasons for the decision. I would seek clarification on any concerns or issues that led to the change in selection and express our commitment to professionalism and ethical conduct in all business dealings. If necessary, I would explore options for addressing any potential unfair treatment through formal channels or professional organizations.
