Question 1:
As the President of Nearby Engineers, I would decline to submit an additional proposal for the project, considering that Trueheart Engineers have already been selected by the Public Works staff. I would prioritize ethical conduct and respect the integrity of the selection process. By abstaining from submitting a proposal, I would uphold transparency and fairness in the procurement process.

Question 2:
As a professional engineer on the County Public Works Department staff and a member of the interview/selection team, I would document the discrepancies between the announced QBS selection process and the Director of Public Works' decision to hire Nearby Engineers. I would raise my concerns with the appropriate authorities within the department, highlighting the importance of adhering to established procedures and maintaining professional integrity. By advocating for transparency and fairness, I would seek to address the deviation from the selection process.

Question 3:
As the Director of Public Works, upon receiving instructions to hire Nearby Engineers regardless of the QBS selection procedure, I would request a meeting with the Board of Supervisors to discuss the situation. I would present the importance of following the established selection process to ensure fairness and transparency in procurement. If necessary, I would seek legal advice on how to navigate the directive while upholding ethical standards. By engaging in open communication and advocating for ethical practices, I would strive to address the conflicting instructions.

Question 4:
As the President of Trueheart Engineers, following the delay in contract approval and the subsequent hiring of Nearby Engineers, I would request a debriefing meeting with the County Public Works Department to understand the reasons for the decision. I would seek clarification on the selection process and express any concerns regarding the fairness of the procurement process. By engaging in constructive dialogue and seeking transparency, I would aim to address any potential issues and maintain a professional relationship with the department.
