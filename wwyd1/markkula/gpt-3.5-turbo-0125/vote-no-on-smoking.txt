In Talia's position, I would schedule a meeting with the university administration to discuss their concerns in more detail. I would ask for specific examples of how the smoking ban could potentially violate student rights and open the university to lawsuits. By gaining a better understanding of the administration's perspective, I could potentially work towards finding a compromise that addresses their concerns while still aligning with the desires of the student body. Additionally, I would communicate openly with my constituency about the university administration's concerns and the complexities of the situation. This transparency would help build understanding and potentially garner support for a decision that may go against their initial wishes.
