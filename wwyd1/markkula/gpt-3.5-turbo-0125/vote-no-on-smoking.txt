In addition to scheduling a meeting with the university administration and seeking legal advice, I would also organize a town hall meeting with the student body to openly discuss the concerns raised by the administration. During the town hall, I would present the administration's perspective on the smoking ban and facilitate a dialogue to address any questions or uncertainties that the students may have. By involving the students in the decision-making process and providing them with a comprehensive understanding of the situation, I aim to foster transparency and build support for a decision that may differ from their initial wishes.

Furthermore, I would conduct a follow-up survey or poll to gauge the student body's response to the information shared during the town hall meeting. This feedback would help me assess whether the students are willing to reconsider their stance on the smoking ban in light of the administration's concerns. By actively engaging with the student body and soliciting their input throughout the decision-making process, I aim to make a well-informed and ethically sound decision that balances the interests of all stakeholders involved.
