In this scenario, I would propose implementing a new policy that requires all members of the funding committee to disclose any potential conflicts of interest, including leadership roles in clubs that are seeking funding. This disclosure would be made prior to any discussion or decision-making related to funding requests. Additionally, I would establish clear guidelines for recusal, mandating that any committee member with a conflict of interest must abstain from voting or participating in discussions regarding their club's funding proposal.

To further ensure fairness and transparency, I would suggest rotating the leadership of the funding committee on a regular basis. This rotation would prevent any single individual from exerting undue influence over funding decisions and promote a more equitable distribution of resources among campus organizations. By implementing these measures, we can uphold the integrity of the funding process and mitigate the risk of bias or favoritism within the student government committee.
