To address the potential conflict of interest within the student government funding committee, Claire should implement a clear policy that requires any member who is also a leader of a club to recuse themselves from the decision-making process when their club's funding request is being discussed. This policy should be communicated to all committee members in a transparent and straightforward manner to ensure compliance.

Additionally, Claire should establish a structured rotation schedule for the leadership of the funding committee. By rotating the leadership role among committee members on a regular basis, Claire can prevent any single individual from exerting undue influence over funding decisions and promote fairness in the allocation process.

To overcome potential challenges or resistance from committee members, including Garret, Claire should hold a meeting to discuss the new policies and the reasons behind their implementation. By fostering open communication and addressing any concerns or questions raised by committee members, Claire can ensure buy-in and cooperation in upholding the integrity and fairness of the funding process.
