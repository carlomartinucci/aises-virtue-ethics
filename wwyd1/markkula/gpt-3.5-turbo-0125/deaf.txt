To address the scenario more effectively, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Prioritize urgent health concerns: In the case of Ali's shortness of breath, I would immediately allocate additional time to thoroughly assess this symptom during the current appointment, ensuring that it is not overlooked or deferred to a follow-up visit.

By proactively addressing the most critical health concern within the available time frame, we can ensure that urgent issues are not neglected, potentially preventing adverse health outcomes.
