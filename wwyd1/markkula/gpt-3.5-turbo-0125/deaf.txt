In a similar scenario, I would take the following actions to address the patient's needs effectively:

1. Prioritize urgent health concerns: If a patient like Ali presents with a serious symptom like shortness of breath, I would ensure that this issue is addressed immediately during the appointment, even if it requires exceeding the allocated time slot.

By focusing on addressing the most critical health concerns first, we can ensure that urgent issues are not overlooked or delayed, potentially preventing adverse health outcomes.
