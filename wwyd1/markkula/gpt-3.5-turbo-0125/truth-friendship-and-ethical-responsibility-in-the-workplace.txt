In this scenario, I would advise Ben to first document all the evidence he has regarding Michael's fraudulent activities, including any conversations, emails, or transactions that indicate wrongdoing. This documentation will serve as crucial evidence to support his claims during the internal investigation.

Next, I would recommend that Ben schedule a meeting with a trusted HR representative or compliance officer within the company to confidentially disclose the information he has uncovered about Michael's fraudulent scheme. During this meeting, Ben should present the documented evidence and provide a detailed account of his knowledge of the situation.

Furthermore, I would suggest that Ben express his concerns about potential repercussions for himself and seek guidance on how to protect his own position within the company while cooperating with the investigation. The HR representative can provide advice on how to navigate this challenging situation and ensure that Ben's actions are in line with company policies and ethical standards.

By taking these specific actions, Ben can demonstrate his commitment to integrity and transparency while also safeguarding his own interests within the company. This approach allows Ben to fulfill his ethical responsibilities while minimizing the potential risks associated with exposing Michael's fraudulent behavior.
