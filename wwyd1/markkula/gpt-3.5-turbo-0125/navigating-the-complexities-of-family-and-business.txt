To address the situation, Mary should first schedule a meeting with all shareholders to discuss the future of the family business. During the meeting, she should propose a detailed plan to hire professional management to oversee the building. Mary can present data and projections showing how this approach can potentially increase the building's value and generate income in the long run. She should emphasize the benefits of maintaining ownership of the building, both financially and sentimentally.

If Donald continues to push for selling the building, Mary should suggest exploring a compromise where he receives a buyout at a discounted rate in line with market practices for minority shareholders. She can highlight the potential negative consequences of selling, such as the significant tax implications and the loss of a valuable family asset. Mary should encourage open dialogue and transparency among all shareholders to ensure that everyone's concerns and perspectives are heard and considered.

Additionally, Mary should propose seeking the advice of a neutral third party, such as a business consultant or mediator, to help facilitate discussions and negotiations among the shareholders. This can help mitigate potential conflicts and ensure that decisions are made in a fair and collaborative manner. By taking these specific actions, Mary can navigate the situation ethically and practically while working towards a solution that balances the interests of all shareholders and preserves the legacy of the family business.
