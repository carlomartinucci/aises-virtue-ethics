To address the situation, Mary should first schedule a meeting with all shareholders to discuss the future of the family business. During the meeting, she should propose the idea of hiring professional management to oversee the building, highlighting the potential benefits of increasing its value and generating income in the long run. Mary should emphasize the importance of preserving the family legacy and the sentimental value of the building to all shareholders.

If Donald remains adamant about selling the building, Mary should suggest exploring a compromise that involves a buyout at a discounted rate in line with market practices for minority shareholders. She should present this as a fair solution that balances the interests of all shareholders while respecting the financial realities of the business.

In addition, Mary should consider seeking the advice of a neutral third party, such as a business consultant or mediator, to help facilitate discussions and negotiations among the shareholders. This external perspective can provide valuable insights and help navigate potential conflicts in a constructive manner.

Ultimately, Mary should prioritize open communication, transparency, and fairness in her interactions with her family members. By approaching the situation with empathy and a willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution, Mary can navigate the complexities of family dynamics and business decisions while upholding ethical principles and preserving relationships within the family.
