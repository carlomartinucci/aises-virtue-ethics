I would have an open and honest conversation with Sophie about the importance of accurately documenting her medical history, including her history of depression, in her medical records. I would explain the potential consequences of not disclosing this information, especially in relation to her future medical licensure applications. I would reassure her that seeking help for mental health issues is a sign of strength and that her well-being should be the top priority.

I would recommend that Sophie pursue therapy in addition to considering antidepressant medication for the management of her depression. I would offer to help her find a therapist who she feels comfortable with and who can provide the support she needs. I would emphasize the benefits of therapy in addressing the underlying issues contributing to her depression and encourage her to prioritize her mental health.

I would work with Sophie to develop a plan for ongoing support and follow-up care, including regular check-ins to monitor her progress with therapy and medication. I would also discuss strategies for navigating the medical licensure process while still prioritizing her mental health, such as seeking legal advice on how to disclose her history of depression in a way that minimizes negative consequences.

Overall, my approach would be to support Sophie in seeking the necessary treatment for her depression while also addressing her concerns about the impact on her medical licensure applications. I would emphasize the importance of honesty and transparency in her medical records and work with her to ensure that she receives the care and support she needs.
