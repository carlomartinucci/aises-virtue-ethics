In Callie's situation, I would immediately rectify the errors in data entry and send out an email to the senior class explaining the situation. In the email, I would inform them that there are five remaining tickets available for Senior Ball and that they will be distributed through a lottery system. Interested seniors would need to reply to the email expressing their desire to participate in the lottery.

Once the deadline for responses has passed, I would randomly select five names from the pool of interested seniors to receive the remaining tickets. This approach ensures fairness and equal opportunity for all students who missed out on purchasing tickets initially. It also avoids any perception of favoritism or bias in the ticket distribution process.

By implementing a lottery system, I can efficiently allocate the remaining tickets while maintaining transparency and inclusivity. This approach allows me to focus on final event preparations and ensures that all seniors have a fair chance to attend Senior Ball.
