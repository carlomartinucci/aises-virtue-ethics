In the scenario presented, I would first rectify the errors in data entry and confirm that there are indeed five remaining tickets available for distribution. To ensure fairness and inclusivity, I would create a simple online form where interested seniors can express their desire to attend Senior Ball. This form would be open for a limited time to prevent an overwhelming number of responses.

After the deadline, I would randomly select five names from the pool of interested seniors to receive the remaining tickets. This lottery system would guarantee equal opportunity for all students who missed out on purchasing tickets initially. Additionally, I would communicate the ticket allocation process transparently to the senior class to maintain trust and integrity in the distribution process.

By implementing a lottery system and communicating openly with the senior class, I would address the critique by providing a more inclusive and equitable solution that maximizes the chances for all students to attend the event, while also maintaining efficiency in the ticket distribution process.
