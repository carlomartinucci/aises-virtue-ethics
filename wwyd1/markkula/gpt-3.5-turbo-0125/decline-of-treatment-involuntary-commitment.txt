I would collaborate with Julia to develop a safety plan that includes identifying her support system, coping strategies, and emergency contacts. I would recommend a consultation with a mental health professional or psychiatrist to explore alternative treatment options tailored to her needs. Additionally, I would schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor her mental health status and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. It is crucial to provide Julia with resources for crisis intervention and support services, ensuring she has access to help when needed.
