To address the points raised in the critique and provide a more ethically sound and practical response to the scenario with Julia:

1. I would involve a mental health professional or psychiatrist in Julia's care to ensure she receives specialized treatment for her major depressive disorder. I would collaborate with the school psychologist to refer Julia to a psychiatrist for a comprehensive evaluation and to discuss potential medication options or alternative therapies tailored to her needs.

2. I would continuously reassess Julia's mental health status and treatment plan to adapt to her changing needs and preferences. Regular follow-up appointments would be scheduled to monitor her progress, address any concerns or side effects from treatment, and make adjustments as necessary to ensure she receives effective care.

3. I would collaborate with Julia to develop a safety plan in case of future crises or worsening symptoms. This plan would include identifying triggers, coping strategies, emergency contacts, and steps to take if she experiences suicidal thoughts or urges. By involving Julia in the development of this plan, she can feel empowered and supported in managing her mental health.

By implementing these specific actions, I aim to provide Julia with comprehensive and individualized care that addresses her mental health needs while respecting her autonomy and ensuring her safety and well-being.
