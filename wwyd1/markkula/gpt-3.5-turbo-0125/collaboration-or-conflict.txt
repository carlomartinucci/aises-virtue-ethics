In Josh's position, I would schedule a face-to-face meeting with Alanna to address the concerns and issues directly. During the meeting, I would express the importance of the event, the impact of the delays on the planning process, and the significance of the collaboration between student government and RHA. I would listen to Alanna's perspective and try to understand the reasons behind her lukewarm response and negative comments. I would propose a clear plan of action, emphasizing the benefits of working together and finding common ground to move forward effectively. If necessary, I would involve both advisors to mediate the discussion and facilitate a productive resolution. Ultimately, the goal would be to salvage the partnership, ensure the success of the event, and maintain the positive relationship between student government and RHA for the benefit of the student body.
