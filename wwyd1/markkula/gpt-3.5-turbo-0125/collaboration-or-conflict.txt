In Josh's position, I would schedule a face-to-face meeting with Alanna to address the issues directly. During the meeting, I would express the urgency of the situation and the potential impact of further delays on the event. I would listen attentively to Alanna's concerns and try to understand the reasons behind her lukewarm response. I would propose a compromise where both organizations share the workload and responsibilities for the event planning to ensure it runs smoothly and successfully. If Alanna remains uncooperative, I would involve both advisors to mediate the discussion and help find a mutually beneficial solution. Additionally, I would start working on a contingency plan in case the collaboration with RHA cannot be salvaged, ensuring that the event can still be organized effectively.
