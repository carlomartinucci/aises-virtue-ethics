I would advise Angela to recuse herself from voting on the funding requests for the campus organizations, including the Hawaiian cultural club's luau event. After recusing herself, Angela should immediately inform another senator about her decision and work collaboratively to ensure that the vote is rescheduled promptly to avoid any unnecessary delays. Additionally, Angela should offer her assistance to help the affected organizations navigate the situation during the delay, such as providing guidance on alternative funding sources or strategies to mitigate the impact of potential budget cuts. By taking these specific actions, Angela can uphold transparency, fairness, and integrity in the decision-making process while also demonstrating her commitment to supporting all campus organizations.
