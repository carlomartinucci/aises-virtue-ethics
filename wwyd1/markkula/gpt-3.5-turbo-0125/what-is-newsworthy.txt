I would recommend that Fatimah schedule a meeting with her editor and campus safety officials to discuss the concerns she has about tweeting campus safety reports. During the meeting, she should express her reservations about the potential impact of sharing sensitive information for entertainment purposes and seek input on how to handle such reports in a more ethical manner. Together, they can review the editorial guidelines and policies to ensure that the publication's values are upheld while still engaging students effectively on social media. Additionally, they could explore the possibility of creating a separate platform or section within the newspaper dedicated to campus safety updates, where the focus is on promoting safety awareness and responsible student conduct rather than entertainment value.
