I would recommend implementing a clear opt-in system for students regarding the collection and use of their data for student retention efforts. This would involve providing detailed information to students about the purpose of data collection, the specific types of data being collected, how it will be used, and who will have access to it. Students should be given the choice to actively consent to participate in these initiatives, ensuring that their privacy rights are respected and that they have control over their personal information. This opt-in system would align with ethical standards of transparency and respect for individual autonomy, allowing students to make informed decisions about the use of their data in improving academic success and retention.
