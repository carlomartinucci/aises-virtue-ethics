To address the situation with Jamie, I would schedule a one-on-one meeting with him to discuss his recent behavior and absences. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about his lack of attendance and communication, emphasizing the impact it is having on the executive council and the initiatives being implemented. I would listen to Jamie's perspective on the challenges he is facing with his classes and other responsibilities.

I would work with Jamie to establish a clear plan moving forward, including setting specific attendance and communication expectations. I would provide additional support or resources if needed, such as offering time management tips or connecting him with academic support services. I would also clearly outline the consequences for continued non-compliance, ensuring that Jamie understands the importance of fulfilling his commitments to the student government.

By taking a proactive and collaborative approach, I aim to address the issues with Jamie while balancing accountability and understanding. This approach prioritizes open communication, support, and clear expectations to help Jamie meet his responsibilities effectively while upholding the integrity of the student government.
