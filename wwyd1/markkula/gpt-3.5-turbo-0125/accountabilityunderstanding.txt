I would schedule a private meeting with Jamie to discuss his recent behavior and absences. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about his lack of attendance and communication, and inquire about any challenges he may be facing. I would listen attentively to Jamie's perspective and offer support in finding solutions to help him balance his commitments.

To address the issue of accountability, I would collaboratively establish clear attendance and communication expectations with Jamie. I would emphasize the importance of fulfilling his responsibilities within the student government and the impact of his actions on the rest of the executive council. Together, we would create a plan outlining specific steps for improvement and consequences for continued non-compliance.

Additionally, I would offer resources and assistance to help Jamie manage his workload and navigate any challenges he may be experiencing. This could include connecting him with academic support services or providing guidance on time management strategies. By showing understanding and providing practical support, I aim to help Jamie overcome his difficulties while upholding accountability within the student government.
