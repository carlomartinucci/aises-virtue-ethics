To address Alexandra's concerns and ensure her confidentiality, I would immediately redact her name and any identifying information from the article. I would also discuss with Alexandra the option of using a pseudonym to further protect her identity while still sharing her story. Additionally, I would inform Alexandra about the publication process and the steps taken to safeguard her privacy, such as securely storing any interview notes and ensuring that her information is not inadvertently disclosed.

Furthermore, to counteract potential negative implications of granting confidentiality to survivors, I would include a statement in the article emphasizing the importance of supporting survivors and dispelling myths about false reporting. I would highlight the courage it takes for survivors to come forward and the need for a safe and respectful environment for them to seek justice.

Lastly, I would consult with experts in the field of sexual assault advocacy to review the article and ensure that it accurately represents the experiences of survivors while also providing a balanced perspective on the federal guidelines. Their input would help to strengthen the article's credibility and sensitivity to the complexities of sexual assault cases on college campuses.
