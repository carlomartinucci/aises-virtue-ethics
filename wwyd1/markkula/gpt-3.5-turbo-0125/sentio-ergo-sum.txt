To address the points raised in the critique and provide a more ethically sound and practical response to the scenario involving the use of the Cogito software at MetLife, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Implement Ongoing Monitoring and Evaluation:
I would establish a regular review process to monitor the implementation of the new disclosure policies and data protection measures. This would involve conducting periodic audits to ensure compliance with privacy regulations and ethical standards. Additionally, feedback mechanisms would be put in place to allow employees and customers to report any concerns or issues related to the software's use.

By actively monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the implemented policies, we can address any shortcomings or areas for improvement promptly, ensuring that ethical standards are upheld consistently.

This specific action focuses on the need for continuous oversight and improvement to maintain ethical practices in the use of AI software at MetLife.
