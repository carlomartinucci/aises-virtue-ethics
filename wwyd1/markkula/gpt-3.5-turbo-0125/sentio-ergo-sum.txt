I would immediately initiate a comprehensive review of the current practices and policies surrounding the use of the Cogito software at MetLife. This review would involve assessing the extent of monitoring and analysis conducted by the software, as well as the notifications provided to employees and customers regarding the nature of the analysis being performed on their interactions.

Following the review, I would collaborate with relevant stakeholders to develop and implement clear and detailed disclosure policies. These policies would aim to provide transparent information to both employees and customers about the specific types of analysis being conducted by the software and the purposes for which the data is being used. Additionally, I would ensure that mechanisms are in place to obtain explicit consent from all parties involved before any data is collected or analyzed.

To enhance data protection measures, I would work closely with the IT and data security teams to implement robust security protocols, data encryption, and access controls. This would help safeguard the sensitive information processed by the AI software and ensure compliance with relevant privacy regulations.

Moreover, I would establish ongoing monitoring and evaluation processes to assess the effectiveness of the implemented policies and make any necessary adjustments. Providing training and education to employees and customers on the implications of the software's analysis and their data rights would also be a priority to promote awareness and understanding.

Lastly, I would create channels for feedback and reporting concerns related to the software's use to address any issues promptly and maintain a culture of transparency and accountability within the organization.
