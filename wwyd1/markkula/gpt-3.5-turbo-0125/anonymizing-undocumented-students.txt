I would suggest that Jessica discuss with Adam the possibility of using a pseudonym or initials in place of his real name in the article. This way, his identity can be protected while still maintaining transparency with the readers. Additionally, Jessica could ask Adam if he would be comfortable with providing a photograph that obscures his face or using stock images to represent him in the article. This visual representation can help add credibility to his story without compromising his safety. Lastly, I would recommend that Jessica reach out to other undocumented students or immigration advocates to gather additional perspectives and insights that can support and corroborate Adam's experiences in the article.
