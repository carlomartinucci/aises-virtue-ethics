To address the critique and provide a more practical response, I would suggest the following specific actions for Jessica:

1. **Seek Corroboration from Trusted Sources**: Jessica can reach out to other undocumented students or immigration advocates who are familiar with Adam's situation. By obtaining additional perspectives or testimonials that support Adam's story, Jessica can strengthen the credibility of the article without compromising Adam's anonymity.

2. **Use General Statistics and Trends**: Jessica can include general statistics and trends related to the challenges faced by undocumented students in higher education. By incorporating broader data points that align with Adam's experiences, Jessica can provide context and validation for his story without revealing his identity.

3. **Discuss Anonymity with Anthony**: Jessica should have a conversation with Anthony, the news editor, about the importance of protecting Adam's identity. By explaining the risks involved and the ethical considerations at play, Jessica can seek support from Anthony in ensuring that Adam's safety is prioritized in the article.

By taking these specific actions, Jessica can navigate the ethical dilemma of including Adam's testimonial in her article while safeguarding his safety and maintaining the credibility of the story.
