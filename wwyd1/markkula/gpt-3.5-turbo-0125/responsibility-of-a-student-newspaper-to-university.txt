In response to the scenario, I would recommend the editorial staff to first convene a meeting to discuss the situation and the potential consequences of their decision. During the meeting, they should consider the ethical implications of removing the quote and the impact on their journalistic integrity. 

After thorough deliberation, if the staff decides to keep the quote in the article, they should draft a statement explaining their decision and publish it alongside the article. This will demonstrate transparency and accountability to their readers and the university administration.

To address the potential loss of university funding, the staff should proactively seek alternative sources of funding to ensure the sustainability of the newspaper. They could explore options such as reaching out to alumni, local businesses, or other organizations for financial support. Additionally, they could consider crowdfunding campaigns or partnerships with local media outlets to secure additional funding.

In the event that the administration follows through on reducing funding, the staff should have a contingency plan in place to mitigate the impact. This could involve budget cuts, exploring cost-saving measures, or diversifying revenue streams through advertising or subscription models.

Overall, by taking a proactive approach to address the ethical dilemma, maintaining transparency in their decision-making process, and seeking alternative sources of funding, the editorial staff can uphold their journalistic integrity while ensuring the sustainability of the student newspaper.
