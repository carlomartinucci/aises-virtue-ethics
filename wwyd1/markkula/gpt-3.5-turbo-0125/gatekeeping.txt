I would propose creating a separate email list specifically for faculty members to share essential information with students. This new list would be managed by the student government and would serve as a platform for faculty members to communicate directly with students about important updates related to registration, financial aid, and graduation. By establishing this dedicated channel, faculty members would have the opportunity to reach students with critical information while also alleviating the pressure on the existing student events email list. This solution would address the concerns raised by faculty members about access to the essential list and help maintain the integrity of the current email communication system. Additionally, I would work closely with faculty members to ensure a smooth transition to the new email list and provide guidance on best practices for effective communication with students.
