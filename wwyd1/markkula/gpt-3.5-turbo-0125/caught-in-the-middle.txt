In Karina's position, I would first schedule separate meetings with the Senate and the Executive Cabinet to listen to their concerns regarding the proposed attendance policy. During these meetings, I would encourage each side to provide specific examples and reasons for their viewpoints to gain a deeper understanding of their perspectives.

After gathering insights from both branches, I would propose a compromise solution that addresses the key concerns raised by each side. This could involve revising the attendance policy to include more flexibility while still maintaining a level of accountability that satisfies the Executive Cabinet's goal of improving overall performance.

To facilitate communication and collaboration between the Senate and the Executive Cabinet, I would organize a joint workshop or training session focused on conflict resolution and effective communication strategies. This would help build trust and understanding between the two branches and provide them with tools to navigate future disagreements in a constructive manner.

Additionally, I would suggest establishing a regular feedback mechanism between the Senate and the Executive Cabinet to address any issues that may arise in the future. This ongoing communication channel would allow for timely resolution of conflicts and promote a culture of transparency and cooperation within the student government organization.
