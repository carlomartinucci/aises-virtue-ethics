In Karina's position, I would take the following specific actions to address the conflict between the Senate and the Executive Cabinet:

1. Facilitate a Mediated Discussion: I would arrange a mediated discussion between representatives from both branches, ensuring that each side has an equal opportunity to express their concerns and perspectives. The mediator would help guide the conversation towards finding common ground and potential solutions.

2. Establish a Joint Task Force: I would propose the creation of a joint task force comprised of members from both the Senate and the Executive Cabinet to collaboratively review and revise the attendance policy. This task force would work together to address the concerns raised by both branches and develop a revised policy that reflects a balanced approach.

3. Conduct a Survey: To gather input from the broader student government body, I would conduct a survey to gauge the opinions and preferences regarding the attendance policy. This data would provide valuable insights and help inform the decision-making process.

By implementing these specific actions, I aim to promote transparency, collaboration, and inclusivity in addressing the conflict between the Senate and the Executive Cabinet. This approach seeks to find a practical and ethical solution that considers the perspectives of all stakeholders involved.
