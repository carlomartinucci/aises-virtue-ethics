To address the ethical concerns surrounding the Diversity in Faces (DiF) dataset created by IBM Research, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Immediately suspend any further distribution of the DiF dataset until a thorough review of the dataset's creation and usage is conducted.
2. Establish a dedicated communication channel on the IBM Research website for individuals to easily identify if their photos are included in the dataset and request the removal of their images.
3. Collaborate with legal experts to develop a comprehensive process for obtaining consent from individuals whose images are used in datasets for AI research.
4. Conduct an audit of all datasets used by IBM Research to ensure compliance with ethical standards and data privacy regulations.
5. Enhance transparency by publishing a detailed report outlining the methodology used to create the DiF dataset and the steps taken to address privacy concerns.
6. Implement regular training sessions for researchers and data scientists on ethical considerations in data collection and usage for AI projects.

These actions aim to address the immediate concerns raised by the creation and distribution of the DiF dataset while establishing a framework for ethical data practices in future AI research projects.
