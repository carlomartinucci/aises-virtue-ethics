Dave should immediately cease the illegal arrangement with Alex and inform the leadership of his organization about the illegal currency exchange activities of the non-profit in the Dominican Republic. He should gather evidence of the illegal transactions and present it to the appropriate authorities for investigation. Dave should also work with his organization to establish a transparent and legal method for exchanging donor funds to support the housing project for the unhoused individuals. Additionally, he should offer support to the individuals affected by the illegal activities of the non-profit and ensure that they are not negatively impacted by the situation.
