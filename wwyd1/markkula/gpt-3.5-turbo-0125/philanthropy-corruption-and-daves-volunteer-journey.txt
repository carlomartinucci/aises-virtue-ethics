I would advise Dave to take the following specific actions:

1. Cease the illegal arrangement with Alex immediately and explain to him the reasons for discontinuing the exchange of funds.
2. Document all the details of the illegal currency exchange activities of the non-profit, including dates, amounts, and individuals involved.
3. Report the illegal activities to the local authorities in the Dominican Republic, providing the documented evidence to support the claim.
4. Seek guidance from his organization's leadership on how to proceed in a way that upholds ethical standards and legal requirements, including potential repercussions on the non-profit and the individuals involved.
5. Work with his organization to establish a legitimate and transparent method for funding the housing project, ensuring compliance with local laws and regulations.

By taking these specific actions, Dave can address the ethical implications of the situation, uphold legal standards, and work towards finding a sustainable and ethical solution for continuing the housing project for the unhoused individuals in the Dominican Republic.
