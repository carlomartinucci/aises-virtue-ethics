In this scenario, Drake can offer a compromise by organizing a workshop or information session for all student organizations to provide general guidance on crafting successful funding proposals. This way, Drake can assist Alex and other students without showing favoritism. During the workshop, Drake can cover key elements of a strong proposal, common pitfalls to avoid, and answer any general questions that student organizations may have. This approach ensures that all groups have access to valuable guidance and support in a fair and transparent manner. Additionally, Drake can offer to provide feedback on specific questions via email or office hours to further assist student organizations while upholding ethical standards.
