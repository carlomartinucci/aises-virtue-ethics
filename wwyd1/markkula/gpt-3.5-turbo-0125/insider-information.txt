In this scenario, Drake should schedule a general workshop or information session for all student organizations to provide guidance on crafting successful funding proposals. This session can cover tips for budgeting, revenue generation ideas, and common pitfalls to avoid. By offering this group session, Drake ensures that all student organizations have access to valuable guidance and support in a fair and transparent manner. This approach allows Drake to assist Alex and other student groups without compromising the integrity of the funding process. Additionally, Drake can offer to answer any specific questions from Alex or other students during the workshop to provide additional support while maintaining a level playing field for all organizations.
