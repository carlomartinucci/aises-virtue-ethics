To enhance the ethical standards within the VR Rage Room app, I would implement a user-friendly reporting system that allows users to easily flag any content that violates the terms of service. This reporting feature would enable swift identification and removal of inappropriate scenarios involving violence towards humans. Additionally, I would create a dedicated section within the app that educates users on the importance of respecting ethical guidelines and provides clear examples of prohibited content. By promoting user awareness and engagement through these measures, we can foster a safer and more responsible community within the VR Rage Room platform.
