I would advise Grace to proactively discuss her situation with the senior members of the student government. During this conversation, Grace should present a detailed plan outlining how she intends to fulfill her responsibilities as a senior class senator despite her early graduation. This plan could include identifying a potential successor for her seat in the spring quarter, ensuring a smooth transition, and committing to completing her ongoing initiatives before her graduation. By demonstrating her commitment to the organization and offering a concrete plan to mitigate the impact of her early departure, Grace can work towards a solution that minimizes disruption and upholds her responsibilities to the student government.
