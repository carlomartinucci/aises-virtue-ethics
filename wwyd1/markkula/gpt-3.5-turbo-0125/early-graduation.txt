I would recommend that Grace proactively discuss her situation with the senior members of the student government. During this conversation, she should express her intention to graduate early and the potential impact on her role as a senior class senator. Grace could propose a plan to identify a suitable replacement for her seat in the spring or suggest adjusting her responsibilities to ensure a smooth transition. By collaborating with the senior members to find a solution that works for everyone, Grace can uphold her commitment to the organization while also considering her personal circumstances.
