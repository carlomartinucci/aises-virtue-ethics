I would recommend that Elena have a conversation with Jack to discuss the inaccuracies in his article regarding the university's affirmative action policies. During this conversation, Elena should emphasize the importance of factual accuracy in journalism and the potential harm that misinformation can cause. I would suggest that Elena work with Jack to revise his article to ensure that it accurately reflects the university's admission process. Additionally, Elena could encourage Jack to consider the broader implications of his argument and the potential impact it may have on readers. By engaging in a constructive dialogue with Jack and guiding him towards a more thoughtful and accurate representation of the issue, Elena can uphold journalistic integrity while also promoting ethical journalism practices.
