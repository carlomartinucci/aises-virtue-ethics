I would immediately speak to the clinic management to request the acquisition of accessible equipment such as adjustable examination tables and scales for patients with mobility disabilities. I would also arrange for additional training sessions for all healthcare staff, including the physician assigned to Michelle's care, on how to properly treat patients with mobility disabilities. Furthermore, I would ensure that there is always sufficient staff available to assist patients like Michelle onto the exam table when needed. Lastly, I would work with the clinic to develop a protocol for accommodating patients with disabilities to prevent similar oversights in the future.
