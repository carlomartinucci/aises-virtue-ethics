I would immediately schedule a meeting with the clinic management to discuss the urgent need for accessible equipment for patients with disabilities. I would request that a plan be put in place to acquire examination tables and other necessary equipment that are accessible for wheelchair users like Michelle. Additionally, I would arrange for the physician assigned to Michelle's care to undergo specialized training in treating patients with mobility disabilities. This training should include proper examination techniques for patients in wheelchairs to prevent oversights like missing sacral ulcers. Finally, I would work with the clinic to establish a protocol for ensuring that all patients, regardless of their physical abilities, receive the necessary care and accommodations during their appointments.
