I would recommend that Snapchat's board of directors immediately convene a special committee to conduct a thorough investigation into the situation involving CEO Evan Spiegel's past emails. The committee should consist of independent directors to ensure impartiality and credibility in the investigation process. The investigation should include interviewing Evan Spiegel, reviewing the content of the emails, and assessing any potential legal implications.

Furthermore, the board should establish a clear timeline for the investigation and communicate transparently with stakeholders about the process and progress. Once the investigation is completed, the board should carefully evaluate the findings and determine the appropriate course of action, which may include issuing a public statement, implementing disciplinary measures, or reassessing Spiegel's role as CEO based on the severity of the behavior outlined in the emails.

It is essential for the board to prioritize the company's values and reputation while handling the situation with integrity and accountability. Open communication with employees, users, and investors is crucial to maintain trust and credibility in the company's leadership.
