I would first review the applications of the remaining candidates to assess their qualifications and potential fit for the specific committees needing representation. If I find that some candidates have relevant skills but may need additional support, I would consider offering them mentorship or training to help them better understand the committee's requirements and expectations.

If after this review, I still believe that the remaining candidates may not be the best fit for the committees, I would reach out to my friends who I believe would be strong candidates for the positions. I would encourage them to apply formally and go through the same selection process as the other candidates to ensure fairness and transparency.

In addition, I would organize a meeting with the committee chairs to discuss the specific needs and preferences they have for their respective committees. This would help me better understand the requirements and expectations, allowing me to make more informed decisions when selecting candidates.

Overall, my goal would be to ensure that the committees are represented by individuals who can contribute effectively while also providing support and guidance to all candidates to help them succeed in their roles.
