I would first review the applications of the remaining candidates to identify any transferable skills or experiences that could potentially make them suitable for the specific committees needing representation. If I find a candidate who shows potential but may need additional support, I would consider setting up a meeting with them to discuss the expectations and requirements of the committee roles. During this meeting, I would offer guidance on how they can enhance their skills or knowledge to better align with the committee's needs.

If after this review I still feel that the remaining candidates are not the best fit for the committees, I would then reach out to my friends who I believe would be strong candidates for the positions. I would explain the situation to them and encourage them to apply, emphasizing the importance of fairness and transparency in the selection process. I would ensure that my friends understand that they need to go through the formal application process and be evaluated based on their qualifications and fit for the roles.

In the end, my goal would be to ensure that the committees are represented by individuals who can contribute effectively while also providing support and guidance to all candidates to help them develop the necessary skills and knowledge for the roles.
