I would schedule a longer appointment with Peter to have a more in-depth conversation about his mental health concerns. During this appointment, I would explain to Peter the potential risks and consequences of untreated bipolar disorder, such as mood swings, impaired functioning, and relationship difficulties. I would also involve Peter's family in the discussion if he agrees, to provide additional support and encouragement for seeking help from a psychiatrist.

I would offer to research and provide Peter with a list of reputable psychiatrists in the area who specialize in mood disorders, and I would assist him in making an appointment with one that he feels comfortable with. I would emphasize the importance of a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional to ensure an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.

If Peter continues to resist seeing a psychiatrist, I would express my concerns about his well-being and the impact that untreated bipolar disorder could have on his life. I would continue to monitor his symptoms closely and encourage him to reconsider seeking help from a specialist. I would document our conversation thoroughly in his medical records to ensure continuity of care and follow-up.
