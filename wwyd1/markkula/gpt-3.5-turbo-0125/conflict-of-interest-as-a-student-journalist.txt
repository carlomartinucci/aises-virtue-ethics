I would recommend that Nadia takes the following specific actions to address the potential bias in her reporting:

1. **Disclose her involvement:** Nadia should explicitly mention in her article that she is a member of the student organization dedicated to social activism and service learning. This disclosure should be placed prominently at the beginning or end of the article to ensure transparency with readers.

2. **Seek diverse perspectives:** In addition to interviewing individuals connected to the protest, Nadia should actively reach out to other stakeholders, such as school administrators, custodial staff members who may not support the protest, and experts in labor rights. By including a range of viewpoints, she can present a more balanced and comprehensive story.

3. **Fact-check and verify information:** Nadia should rigorously fact-check all information obtained during her reporting. This includes verifying statistics, quotes, and any claims made by sources. By ensuring the accuracy of her reporting, Nadia can mitigate the risk of unintentional bias influencing her coverage.

By implementing these specific actions, Nadia can demonstrate her commitment to ethical journalism practices and maintain her credibility as a fair and objective reporter.
