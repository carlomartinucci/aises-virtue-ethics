Ben should express his concerns about the child labor issue directly to JP and the villagers. He should emphasize the importance of protecting the well-being and rights of the children involved. Ben could propose implementing a system where children are not directly involved in the labor but instead have access to education and other opportunities for their development. He could offer to support initiatives that provide educational resources and vocational training for the families to improve their economic situation without relying on child labor. Ben should also suggest collaborating with local organizations or NGOs that specialize in child welfare and labor rights to ensure a sustainable and ethical solution to the issue.
