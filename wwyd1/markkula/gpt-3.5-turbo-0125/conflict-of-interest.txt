In this scenario, if I were in Miguel's position, I would temporarily step back from my active role in the outdoor club to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. I would communicate openly with the club members about my decision, emphasizing the importance of upholding ethical standards and maintaining neutrality in my role within Associated Students.

To ensure continuity and support for the club's activities during my absence, I would work with the club's leadership to delegate responsibilities to other members. This would allow the club to continue its operations smoothly while I focus on my duties in student government.

Additionally, I would actively seek ways to support the club from a distance, such as providing guidance and advice to the leadership team, attending meetings as a non-voting member, and staying informed about the club's progress. By maintaining a supportive and engaged presence, I can demonstrate my commitment to the club's goals while upholding ethical standards in my role within Associated Students.

Overall, by temporarily stepping back from my active role in the outdoor club, delegating responsibilities, and maintaining open communication with club members, I can navigate the potential conflict of interest effectively and ensure that both roles are fulfilled with integrity and transparency.
