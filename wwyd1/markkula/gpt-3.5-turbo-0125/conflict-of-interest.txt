In this scenario, if I were in Miguel's shoes, I would delegate my responsibilities within the outdoor club to other capable members while maintaining a non-decision-making role during the petitioning process. I would communicate with the club members about my decision to step back temporarily, ensuring transparency and understanding. By delegating tasks and responsibilities, I can still support the club's activities and growth while avoiding any potential conflicts of interest in my role within Associated Students. This approach allows me to uphold ethical standards, maintain neutrality, and fulfill my duties effectively in both organizations.
