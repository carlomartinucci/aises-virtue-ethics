I would immediately reach out to the university's disability services office to collaborate on creating accessible resources for neurodiverse students regarding consent. I would propose organizing a focus group with neurodiverse students to gather feedback on the current materials and identify specific challenges they face in understanding consent cues. Based on this feedback, I would work with the disability services office and potentially the university's psychology department to develop clear, concrete guidelines on consent that are universally understandable. These guidelines could include written descriptions, visual aids, and possibly interactive scenarios to help neurodiverse students recognize and communicate consent effectively. I would prioritize the prompt revision of the materials to ensure that neurodiverse students have access to accurate and actionable information on consent to prevent potential harm.
