I would immediately reach out to experts in neurodiversity and sexual assault prevention to gather insights on how to effectively communicate consent to neurodiverse individuals. I would then organize a focus group with neurodiverse students to gather feedback on the current materials and understand their specific needs and preferences. Based on this input, I would work with the sexual assault prevention center to revise the resources, ensuring they are clear, concrete, and universally applicable. Additionally, I would propose the creation of visual aids and step-by-step guides to enhance understanding and inclusivity. Finally, I would prioritize the prompt implementation of these revised materials to better support and protect neurodiverse students on campus.
