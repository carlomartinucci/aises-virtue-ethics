To address the ethical concerns raised by the data-sharing agreement between Crisis Text Line and Loris.ai, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Conduct a detailed review of the data-sharing agreement, focusing on the specific language used to inform users about how their data would be shared and used. This review would aim to ensure that the terms are clear, easily understandable, and transparent to users.

2. Organize a series of focus groups or surveys with both volunteers and users of Crisis Text Line to gather direct feedback on their thoughts and concerns regarding the data-sharing arrangement. This feedback would be crucial in understanding the impact of the agreement on those directly involved with the organization.

3. Initiate a dialogue with the leadership team of Crisis Text Line to discuss the findings from the review and feedback sessions. This discussion would aim to evaluate the ethical implications of the data-sharing agreement and explore potential alternatives or modifications to ensure that user consent is fully informed and respected.

By taking these specific actions, I aim to address the ethical concerns surrounding the data-sharing agreement in a practical and transparent manner, prioritizing the well-being and trust of both users and volunteers of Crisis Text Line.
