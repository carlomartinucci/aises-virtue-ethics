I would immediately initiate a transparent communication process with all volunteers and users of Crisis Text Line to address the concerns raised regarding the data-sharing agreement with Loris.ai. This would involve organizing open forums or town hall meetings where volunteers and users can express their thoughts and ask questions about the agreement. Additionally, I would create a feedback mechanism, such as a dedicated email address or online form, for volunteers and users to submit their feedback anonymously if they prefer.

Simultaneously, I would conduct a detailed review of the data-sharing agreement to ensure that user consent processes are clear, transparent, and easily understandable. If any ambiguities or complexities are identified, I would work with legal experts to revise the agreement and make necessary adjustments to enhance user understanding and consent.

Furthermore, I would establish a dedicated ethics committee within Crisis Text Line, comprising volunteers, users, and external experts in data ethics and privacy. This committee would be responsible for regularly reviewing data-sharing practices, ensuring alignment with ethical standards, and providing recommendations for any future data-sharing agreements or partnerships.

Lastly, I would commit to providing regular updates to all stakeholders on the progress made in addressing the concerns raised, as well as any changes implemented as a result of the feedback received. Open and transparent communication will be key in rebuilding trust and ensuring that the organization's mission of supporting individuals in crisis is upheld with the highest ethical standards.
