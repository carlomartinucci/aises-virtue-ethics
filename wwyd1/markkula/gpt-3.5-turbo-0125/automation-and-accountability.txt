I would start by reaching out to legal aid organizations in Michigan to understand the specific legal avenues available for those impacted by the MiDAS system. By collaborating with these organizations, I can gather information on ongoing lawsuits and provide direct support to individuals seeking justice.

Additionally, I would work with community leaders to organize town hall meetings or information sessions where affected residents can share their stories and concerns. This would help raise awareness about the issue and mobilize community support for those seeking restitution.

Furthermore, I would engage with local media outlets to highlight the human impact of the faulty MiDAS system. By sharing personal stories and shedding light on the injustices faced by Michigan residents, we can amplify their voices and pressure state officials to take responsibility for the system's errors.

Lastly, I would advocate for policy reforms at the state level to ensure greater transparency and accountability in the use of automated systems. By working with lawmakers and advocacy groups, we can push for regulations that prevent similar injustices from occurring in the future and hold those responsible for the MiDAS system accountable.
