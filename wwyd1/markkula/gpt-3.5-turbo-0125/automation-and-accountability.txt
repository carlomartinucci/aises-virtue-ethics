To address the issue of the faulty MiDAS system and its impact on Michigan residents, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Engage with Legal Aid Organizations**: I would directly reach out to legal aid organizations in Michigan that are already involved in supporting the residents impacted by the MiDAS system. By collaborating with these organizations, I can gain insights into the legal challenges faced by the affected individuals and identify opportunities to provide additional support or resources.

By focusing on concrete actions such as engaging with legal aid organizations, I aim to enhance the practicality and specificity of the response to ensure a more effective and targeted approach to addressing the issue.
