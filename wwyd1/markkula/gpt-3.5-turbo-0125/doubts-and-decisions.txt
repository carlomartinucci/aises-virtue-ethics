In Leah's position, I would first express my gratitude to the President and Vice President for offering me the Director of Marketing position. I would then request a meeting with them to discuss my concerns and interests in exploring other areas within the organization, such as leadership development, community service, or women's affairs. During the meeting, I would share my passion for student government and my desire to contribute meaningfully in a role that aligns more closely with my skills and interests.

If after the meeting, the President and Vice President are open to considering me for a different position that better aligns with my passions and skills, I would explore those opportunities further. However, if the Director of Marketing position remains the only option, I would carefully evaluate the potential impact of accepting the role on both the organization and my friend who wanted the position.

In making my decision, I would prioritize open and honest communication with my friend, explaining my reasons for accepting the Director of Marketing position and reassuring her of my continued support and collaboration. I would also consider the long-term benefits of gaining diverse experiences within the organization for my future goals, such as running for President someday.

Ultimately, I would aim to make a decision that balances my personal growth and contributions to the organization while maintaining integrity and empathy towards my friend.
