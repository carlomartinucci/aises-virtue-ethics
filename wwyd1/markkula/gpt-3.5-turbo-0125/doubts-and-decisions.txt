In Leah's position, I would express my gratitude to the President and Vice President for offering me the Director of Marketing position. I would then request a meeting with them to discuss my concerns and interests in exploring other areas within the organization, such as leadership development, community service, or women's affairs. During the meeting, I would share my passion for student government and my desire to contribute meaningfully in a role that aligns more closely with my skills and interests.

If after the meeting, it becomes clear that the Director of Marketing position is the best fit for me at this time, I would accept the role with a positive attitude and a commitment to excel in the position. I would also reach out to my friend who wanted the position and have an honest conversation with her about my decision, explaining my reasons for accepting the role and reassuring her of my continued support and collaboration in the organization.

Furthermore, I would actively seek opportunities within the organization to contribute to leadership development, community service, or women's affairs initiatives in addition to my responsibilities in marketing. By demonstrating my commitment to the organization and exploring various avenues for growth and impact, I can continue to pursue my long-term goal of running for President while making a valuable contribution to the organization in the present moment.
