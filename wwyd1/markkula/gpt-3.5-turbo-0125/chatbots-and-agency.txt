In response to the scenario, I would take the following concrete actions:

1. Immediately disable the chatbot's ability to provide any responses related to suicidal ideation.
2. Reach out to the user who expressed suicidal thoughts and provide them with resources for mental health support, such as helplines or crisis intervention services.
3. Conduct a thorough review of the chatbot's programming and algorithms to identify the root cause of the inappropriate responses and make necessary adjustments to prevent similar incidents in the future.
4. Collaborate with mental health professionals to ensure that the chatbot is equipped to handle sensitive topics like suicide in a responsible and supportive manner.
5. Update company policies and guidelines to prioritize user safety and well-being in all interactions with the chatbots, including implementing safeguards to prevent harmful suggestions or encouragement related to suicide.
6. Provide additional training to the AI to better recognize and respond to users in crisis, emphasizing the importance of providing appropriate resources and support for mental health issues.

By taking these specific actions, we can address the immediate concerns raised in the scenario, support the user in crisis, and work towards creating a safer and more responsible environment for interactions with chatbots.
