To address the financial challenge of the doubled price for the retreat site, Carlos should first conduct a thorough review of the student government budget to identify any potential areas where costs can be reduced or reallocated. He should prioritize essential programs that directly benefit the student body and consider reallocating funds from less critical areas to cover the increased cost of the retreat.

Additionally, Carlos should explore the possibility of negotiating with the retreat site management to see if there are any opportunities for cost savings or discounts. He could also consider adjusting the duration or format of the retreat to make it more cost-effective while still maintaining its core objectives and benefits.

Furthermore, Carlos should engage with the student government members to discuss the situation transparently and seek their input on potential solutions. By involving the members in the decision-making process, Carlos can gather valuable perspectives and ideas that may help in finding a balanced and ethical solution that prioritizes both the retreat's impact on student government leaders and the funding needs of programs benefiting the student body.
