To address the financial challenge of the doubled cost for the student government retreat, Carlos should first conduct a thorough review of the budget to identify any areas where costs can be reduced or reallocated. He should prioritize essential expenses for the retreat while looking for potential savings in non-essential areas. Additionally, Carlos should explore the possibility of negotiating with the retreat site to see if there are any opportunities for cost reduction or flexible payment terms.

If after these steps, the budget shortfall still exists, Carlos should consider proposing a temporary reduction in funding for non-essential student government programs rather than cutting from programs that directly benefit the student body. By presenting this as a temporary measure and communicating transparently with the student body about the reasons behind the decision, Carlos can demonstrate accountability and maintain trust within the organization.

Simultaneously, Carlos should actively seek out alternative funding sources, such as reaching out to alumni or local businesses for sponsorships, organizing a crowdfunding campaign, or hosting a fundraising event specifically for the retreat. By diversifying the funding streams for the retreat, Carlos can mitigate the impact on the overall student government budget while ensuring the continuation of the valuable off-campus retreat experience for student government members.

In summary, Carlos should prioritize essential expenses for the retreat, explore cost-saving measures, negotiate with the retreat site, temporarily reduce funding for non-essential programs, and actively seek alternative funding sources to address the financial challenge while upholding the organization's commitment to both student government leaders and the student body.
