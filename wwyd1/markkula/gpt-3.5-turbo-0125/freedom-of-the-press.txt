Carrie should include the topic of the new statue and the jokes surrounding it in her video about trending conversation topics among students on campus. To ensure a fair representation of different perspectives, she can interview a diverse group of students to capture a range of opinions about the statue. Carrie should focus on presenting the topic objectively, without adding personal bias or overly negative commentary.

Additionally, Carrie can address potential concerns from the university administration by highlighting the importance of transparency and authenticity in representing student voices. She can emphasize that discussing controversial topics in a respectful and constructive manner is essential for fostering open dialogue within the student community. By framing the discussion as a reflection of student sentiment rather than an attack on the university or donors, Carrie can navigate the situation ethically while staying true to her role as a representative of the student body.
