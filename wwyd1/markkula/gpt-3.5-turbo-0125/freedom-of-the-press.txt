To address the critique and provide a more practical response to the scenario, Carrie should consider the following actions:

1. Conduct Student Interviews: Carrie can interview a diverse group of students to gather their perspectives on the new statue. By including a range of opinions in the video, she can present a more balanced view of the student body's conversations.

2. Highlight Positive Aspects: In addition to discussing the jokes and criticisms surrounding the statue, Carrie can also highlight any positive aspects or unique features of the statue. This can help provide a more nuanced portrayal of the topic.

3. Seek Approval from Student Government: Before finalizing the video, Carrie should seek approval from the student government body to ensure that the content aligns with their values and goals. This collaborative approach can help address any concerns about potential backlash from the university administration.

By taking these specific actions, Carrie can ethically and practically navigate the situation, reflecting student conversations while also being mindful of the potential impact on donor relations and university reputation.
