In addition to scheduling a meeting with his direct supervisor to address the discrepancy in sales reporting, Tre should take the following specific actions:

1. Document the discrepancies: Tre should meticulously document each instance where sales of basic products were inaccurately classified as sales of advanced products. This documentation should include dates, amounts, and any relevant details that support his findings.

By documenting the discrepancies, Tre will have a clear record to present during the meeting with his supervisor, strengthening his case and providing concrete evidence of the issue.

This specific action will help Tre to present a well-supported case during the meeting with his supervisor and demonstrate the seriousness of the situation. It will also help him to navigate potential pushback or resistance by having a detailed record of the discrepancies.
