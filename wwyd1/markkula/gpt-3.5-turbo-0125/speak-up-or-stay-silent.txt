By approaching the conversation with a focus on problem-solving and collaboration, Tre can demonstrate his professionalism and dedication to addressing the issue constructively.

Overall, by documenting the discrepancies, presenting the evidence, and engaging in a transparent discussion with his supervisor, Tre can take a proactive step towards resolving the issue while upholding ethical standards within the company.
