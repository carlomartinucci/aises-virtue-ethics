Bruce should schedule a meeting with Spencer to discuss his request for an emotional support animal. During the meeting, Bruce should express his support for Spencer's well-being and the value he brings to the organization. Bruce should then inquire about the specific needs of Spencer's emotional support animal and how it helps him in his work.

To address the concerns about potential allergies and phobias among students and staff, Bruce should conduct a survey to gather information on any allergies or fears related to dogs. Based on the survey results, Bruce can assess the feasibility of accommodating Spencer's emotional support animal while ensuring the comfort and safety of everyone involved.

Bruce should also work closely with HR and legal counsel to understand the legal obligations and accommodations required for emotional support animals in the workplace. Together, they can explore potential solutions to accommodate Spencer's needs, such as providing a single room, setting boundaries for the dog's presence, and arranging transportation that minimizes disruptions for others.

By taking a collaborative and proactive approach, Bruce can find a solution that balances Spencer's needs with the organization's constraints, ultimately fostering a supportive and inclusive work environment for all employees and students.
