To address the exclusion of the Navajo tribe from the negotiations and decision-making processes regarding water allocation from the Colorado River, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Facilitate Direct Engagement: I would work to establish a formal platform for direct engagement between Navajo Nation representatives and key stakeholders involved in the water allocation discussions. This platform could take the form of a dedicated working group or advisory committee where Navajo voices are actively included in the decision-making process.

By creating a structured mechanism for dialogue and collaboration, we can ensure that the concerns and perspectives of the Navajo tribe are integrated into the negotiations, leading to more equitable outcomes for all parties involved.

This action is practical and actionable, as it provides a concrete step towards addressing the historical exclusion of the Navajo tribe and promoting their meaningful participation in shaping water allocation decisions related to the Colorado River.
