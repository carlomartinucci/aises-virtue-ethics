I would initiate a direct collaboration with Navajo tribal leaders and representatives to ensure their active participation in the negotiations and decision-making processes related to water allocation from the Colorado River. This would involve organizing regular meetings and consultations with Navajo Nation officials to discuss their water rights, access issues, and concerns. By establishing a dedicated task force that includes Navajo representatives, we can ensure that their voices are heard and their perspectives are integrated into the decision-making process.

Furthermore, I would work towards implementing immediate measures to address the water access challenges faced by the Navajo tribe. This could involve partnering with relevant agencies and organizations to improve water infrastructure on the Navajo reservation, such as investing in water treatment facilities, pipelines, and distribution systems. By taking concrete actions to provide safe and reliable water sources for all members of the Navajo Nation, we can help alleviate the environmental injustices they have historically faced and promote equitable access to water resources.

Overall, by actively involving the Navajo tribe in the discussions and taking tangible steps to address their water access issues, we can work towards achieving a more ethical and inclusive approach to water allocation from the Colorado River.
