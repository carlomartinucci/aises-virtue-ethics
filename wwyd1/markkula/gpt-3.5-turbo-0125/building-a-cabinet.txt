This process should include team-building activities, goal-setting sessions, and conflict resolution training to foster a positive and collaborative environment from the start. By proactively addressing any lingering tensions and promoting open communication, Marcus can help mitigate the risk of resentment impacting the team dynamics.

He should clearly communicate the criteria and considerations that guided his selection of executive cabinet members to all candidates, including those who were not chosen. By providing feedback and rationale for his choices, Marcus can demonstrate respect for all candidates and uphold the principles of fairness and integrity in his leadership.

Furthermore, Marcus should actively engage with the entire executive cabinet to establish shared goals and expectations for their roles. By facilitating open dialogue and encouraging input from all members, Marcus can promote a sense of ownership and collaboration within the team. This inclusive approach will help build trust and unity among the diverse group of individuals, regardless of their previous campaign affiliations.
