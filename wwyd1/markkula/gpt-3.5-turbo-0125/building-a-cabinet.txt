In Marcus's position, I would start by organizing a team-building session with all the potential candidates for the executive cabinet. This session would focus on fostering open communication, building trust, and setting expectations for collaboration and unity within the team. During this session, I would encourage candid discussions about the recent election and the importance of moving forward collectively for the benefit of the student government.

Following the team-building session, I would conduct individual meetings with each candidate, including both the opposing candidates and Marcus's campaign supporters who applied for positions. These meetings would serve as an opportunity for me to assess each candidate's commitment to the organization's goals, their ability to work collaboratively with others, and their proposed contributions to the executive cabinet.

In making my decision for the crucial third spot in the executive cabinet, I would prioritize selecting a candidate who demonstrates a strong alignment with the organization's values and a willingness to set aside personal feelings for the greater good of the team. I would also consider the candidate's track record of working effectively in team environments and their potential to contribute positively to the organization's success.

Ultimately, my goal would be to create a balanced executive cabinet that combines diverse perspectives, experiences, and strengths to drive the organization forward. By fostering a culture of open communication, trust, and unity within the team, I believe we can overcome any potential challenges stemming from the election and work together towards achieving our shared goals for the student government.
