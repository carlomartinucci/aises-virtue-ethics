I would conduct a thorough review of the technology company's data protection measures, ensuring they align with industry best practices and legal requirements. I would specifically look for encryption protocols, access controls, and data retention policies to safeguard the privacy of individuals captured in the video recordings. Additionally, I would engage with legal experts to assess the implications of sharing the footage with the technology company, focusing on compliance with relevant privacy laws and regulations.

To gather input from the city's residents, I would organize public town hall meetings and online surveys to gauge their opinions on the proposal. I would clearly communicate the details of the plan, including how the data would be used and protected, to ensure transparency and build trust with the community. Based on the feedback received, I would carefully consider the concerns and preferences of the residents before making a decision on whether to grant access to the video recordings.

In negotiating the agreement with the technology company, I would establish strict terms outlining the limited use of the data for emotion-recognition AI purposes only. I would include provisions for regular audits of their data handling practices and mechanisms for reporting any breaches or misuse of the information. By taking these steps, I aim to balance the potential benefits of the proposal with the protection of individuals' privacy rights and the trust of the community.
