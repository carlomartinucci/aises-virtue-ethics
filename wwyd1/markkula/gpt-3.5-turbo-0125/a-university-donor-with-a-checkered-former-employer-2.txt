I would thank the donor for their interest in supporting the university and express appreciation for their willingness to give back to the community. I would then kindly request more information from the donor about their specific role and tenure at the financial group to better understand their individual involvement and values. This information would help in assessing the alignment of the donation with the university's values.

After gathering relevant details, I would consult with the university's leadership and ethics committee to discuss the donor's background and the potential implications of accepting the donation. We would carefully evaluate whether the donor's values and actions align with the university's commitment to diversity, inclusion, and ethical practices.

If, after thorough consideration, it is determined that the donor's values and actions are in line with the university's principles, I would proceed with accepting the donation and express gratitude for their support. However, if there are concerns about the donor's past actions conflicting with the university's values, I would politely decline the donation while thanking the donor for their interest in supporting the university.
