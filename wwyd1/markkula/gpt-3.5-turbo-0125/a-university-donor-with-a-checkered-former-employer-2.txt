I would thank the donor for their interest in supporting the university and express appreciation for their willingness to give back to the community. I would then request a meeting with the donor to discuss their tenure at the financial group and gain a better understanding of their individual values and actions during their time there.

During the meeting, I would ask the donor specific questions about their role at the financial group, their knowledge of the predatory lending practices, and their personal stance on ethical business practices. I would also inquire about their motivations for supporting the university and their views on diversity and inclusion in STEM fields.

Following the meeting, I would conduct a thorough background check on the donor to verify the information provided and assess any potential red flags. I would also consult with the university's ethics committee to review the donor's history and values in relation to the university's mission and values.

Based on the information gathered and the committee's recommendations, I would make an informed decision on whether to accept the donation. If the donor's actions and values align with the university's commitment to diversity, inclusion, and ethical practices, I would proceed with accepting the donation and express gratitude for their support. If there are concerns about the donor's past actions conflicting with the university's principles, I would politely decline the donation while thanking the donor for their interest in supporting the university.
