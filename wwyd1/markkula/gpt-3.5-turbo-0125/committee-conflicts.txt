I would recommend that Tyler prioritize connecting with his constituents by setting aside dedicated time each week to engage with students directly. This could involve hosting open office hours, attending student organization meetings, or organizing town hall events to gather feedback and address concerns. By actively seeking input from his constituents, Tyler can better understand their needs and effectively represent them within the student government.

In terms of his committee work, Tyler could propose to his fellow Senators the idea of delegating specific tasks within projects to allow for more flexibility in balancing committee responsibilities with engaging with constituents. This approach would demonstrate Tyler's commitment to both his committee work and his constituents while also fostering a collaborative environment within the student government.

Additionally, Tyler could leverage technology to stay connected with his constituents, such as creating a dedicated email address or social media accounts for students to reach out to him with their feedback and concerns. By utilizing digital platforms, Tyler can engage with a broader range of students and ensure that their voices are heard in the decision-making process.

Overall, by proactively engaging with his constituents, collaborating with his fellow Senators on balancing responsibilities, and utilizing technology to facilitate communication, Tyler can effectively represent the changing needs of his constituency while fulfilling his duties within the student government.
