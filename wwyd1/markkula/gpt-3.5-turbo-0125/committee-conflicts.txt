To address the concerns raised in the scenario, Tyler should take the following specific actions:

1. **Initiate a Proposal for Rotating Responsibilities:** Tyler should draft a detailed proposal outlining the benefits of rotating responsibilities within the committee to allow members more time to engage with constituents. This proposal should include a clear schedule for rotation, highlighting how this approach can enhance the committee's effectiveness in addressing student needs.

By proactively presenting this proposal during a Senate meeting, Tyler can demonstrate his commitment to both his committee work and representing his constituents. This approach fosters collaboration and shows that Tyler is actively seeking solutions to balance his responsibilities.

By taking these steps, Tyler can navigate potential pushback from his peers and work towards a more balanced approach that prioritizes both committee projects and connecting with the student body.
