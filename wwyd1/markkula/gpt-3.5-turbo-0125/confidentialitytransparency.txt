If I were Akira, I would offer the senator a compromise by suggesting that he could submit any questions or concerns he has in writing to be addressed during the meeting. This way, his perspective is still considered without compromising the confidentiality of the disciplinary discussion. I would assure the senator that his input is valued and will be taken into account during the decision-making process. If the senator continues to insist on staying, I would politely but firmly reiterate the importance of maintaining confidentiality in disciplinary matters and explain that it is in the best interest of all parties involved. I would emphasize that the decision is not about excluding him but rather about upholding the privacy and dignity of the individuals affected. If necessary, I would offer to meet with the senator separately after the meeting to address his concerns and provide him with a summary of the proceedings to ensure transparency and accountability.
