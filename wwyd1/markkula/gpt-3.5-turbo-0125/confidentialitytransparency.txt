If I were Akira, I would calmly explain to the senator the importance of maintaining confidentiality in disciplinary matters to protect the privacy and well-being of the individuals involved. I would offer to provide a summary of the proceedings after the meeting to ensure transparency while still respecting the need for privacy during the discussion. If the senator continues to insist on staying, I would suggest that he submit any questions or concerns in writing to be addressed after the meeting, ensuring that his voice is heard while upholding the confidentiality of the discussion.
