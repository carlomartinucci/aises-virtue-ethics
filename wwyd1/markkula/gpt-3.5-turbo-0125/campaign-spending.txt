To address the ethical dilemma in the scenario, James should revise his campaign strategy to ensure fairness and equal opportunity for all candidates. Instead of renting luxury cars to drive students to classes on Election Day, James could organize a more inclusive and community-focused event, such as a campus-wide rally or a voter engagement initiative. By shifting the focus from extravagant displays to meaningful engagement with the student body, James can demonstrate his commitment to ethical campaigning practices and create a more level playing field for all candidates.

Additionally, James could collaborate with Alix to co-host a joint event or initiative that promotes voter participation and awareness. By working together, James and Alix can showcase their leadership skills and dedication to serving the student body, while also fostering a spirit of cooperation and unity within the student government election process. This collaborative approach not only benefits both candidates but also sets a positive example for future campaigns and reinforces the values of fairness and integrity in student government elections.
