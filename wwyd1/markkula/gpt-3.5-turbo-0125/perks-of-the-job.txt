I would schedule a private meeting with Julia to discuss the issue. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about the misuse of office resources and supplies for personal homework. I would suggest finding alternative solutions, such as using her own personal resources for homework or finding ways to reduce printing costs, to ensure that the organization's budget is being used efficiently for student programs. I would emphasize the importance of setting a good example for other members and maintaining the integrity of the organization. If Julia is resistant to change or continues to misuse resources, I would seek guidance from higher authorities within the organization to address the situation appropriately.
