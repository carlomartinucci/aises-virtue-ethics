I would schedule a private meeting with Julia to discuss the issue of her misuse of office resources. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about the impact on the organization's budget and the importance of setting a good example for other members. I would suggest finding alternative solutions, such as using her own personal resources for homework or exploring ways to reduce printing costs. I would also emphasize the need to adhere to the rules and guidelines set in place for the proper use of resources. If the issue persists after the meeting, I would consider seeking guidance from higher authorities within the organization to address the situation effectively.
