I would schedule a meeting with John to discuss his recent struggles and the concerning behaviors he has shared with me. During this meeting, I would express my deep concern for his well-being and emphasize the importance of seeking professional help. I would offer to assist him in finding a mental health professional or a substance abuse counselor and provide support in making an appointment. I would also reach out to other church members who have experience in these areas to gather additional resources and support for John. Additionally, I would continue to offer spiritual guidance and prayer while encouraging John to prioritize his physical and mental health by seeking appropriate professional help.
