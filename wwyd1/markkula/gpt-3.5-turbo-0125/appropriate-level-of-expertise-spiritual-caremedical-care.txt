I would schedule a private meeting with John to express my deep concern about his well-being and the risks associated with his current situation. During this meeting, I would emphasize the urgency of seeking professional help and offer to assist him in finding a mental health professional or substance abuse counselor. I would stress the importance of prioritizing his health and well-being for himself and his family.

I would also reach out to other church members who have experience in mental health or addiction counseling to provide additional support and resources for John. Additionally, I would encourage John to attend a support group meeting, such as the church's Alcoholics Anonymous chapter, and offer to accompany him for added support.

Throughout this process, I would continue to provide spiritual guidance and support for John, while also respecting the boundaries of my role as a pastor and not attempting to provide professional counseling beyond my expertise. I would follow up with John regularly to ensure he is taking steps towards getting the help he needs and offer ongoing support and encouragement.
