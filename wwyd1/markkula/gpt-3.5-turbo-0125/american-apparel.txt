I would immediately initiate a thorough investigation into the allegations of sexual harassment and misuse of company funds against Dov Charney. This investigation would involve interviewing employees, reviewing relevant documents, and gathering any other evidence to determine the extent of the misconduct.

Based on the findings of the investigation, I would take swift and decisive action in accordance with the company's code of conduct and policies. This may include disciplinary measures, termination of employment, or other appropriate actions to address the misconduct and ensure a safe and respectful work environment for all employees.

Furthermore, I would work closely with HR and legal counsel to ensure that all steps taken are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. I would also communicate transparently with the board of directors and relevant stakeholders to provide updates on the situation and the actions being taken to address it.

In addition to addressing the immediate issues at hand, I would implement measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. This may involve revising company policies, providing training on appropriate workplace behavior, and fostering a culture of respect and professionalism throughout the organization.

Overall, my focus would be on upholding ethical standards, ensuring accountability for misconduct, and fostering a positive and inclusive work environment at American Apparel.
