I would recommend that Mayor Schaaf issue a public statement addressing the concerns raised by critics regarding her decision to announce the ICE raids. In the statement, she should emphasize the importance of public safety while also acknowledging the need to balance this with the rights and well-being of undocumented immigrants. Mayor Schaaf should commit to working collaboratively with ICE officials to address their concerns and find common ground in ensuring the safety of all residents.

Additionally, Mayor Schaaf should provide evidence to support the accuracy of the information she received through unofficial channels and clarify the legal and ethical considerations that guided her decision-making process. She should also highlight the steps taken to verify the information and ensure its credibility before making the public announcement.

Moving forward, Mayor Schaaf should engage in dialogue with legal experts and community leaders to develop a more strategic and effective approach for communicating with the immigrant community. This could involve establishing clear protocols for handling sensitive information related to immigration enforcement actions and ensuring that communication methods prioritize the safety and well-being of vulnerable populations.

By taking these specific actions, Mayor Schaaf can demonstrate a commitment to transparency, integrity, and ethical decision-making while also addressing the concerns raised by critics and working towards a more inclusive and collaborative approach to immigration enforcement in Oakland.
