To address Bryson's situation more effectively, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Schedule a meeting with each individual staff member separately to discuss their current workload and stress levels. This one-on-one approach allows for a more candid conversation about their capacity and challenges.

2. Reevaluate the delegation of tasks by identifying non-essential responsibilities that can be temporarily put on hold or reassigned to other team members. This will help alleviate the workload burden on Bryson's staff.

3. Prioritize the state-level advocacy duties related to student financial aid and government funding by personally taking on a more active role in these efforts. This demonstrates leadership and commitment to fulfilling crucial responsibilities.

4. Implement a rotating schedule where each staff member takes the lead on specific tasks related to community relations and state-level advocacy. This approach ensures that everyone has a chance to contribute meaningfully while preventing burnout.

5. Explore the possibility of hiring temporary support or interns to assist with specific projects or tasks that require additional resources. This can help lighten the workload for Bryson and his team without compromising the quality of work.

By taking these specific actions, Bryson can address the workload imbalance, prioritize essential responsibilities, and ensure that both community relations and state-level advocacy efforts are effectively managed. This approach promotes a more sustainable and equitable distribution of tasks within the team while maintaining a focus on fulfilling the core responsibilities of Bryson's role.
