I would schedule a meeting with my student staff to discuss their current workload and gather feedback on how they are managing their responsibilities. During the meeting, I would openly communicate my concerns about potentially overloading them and inquire about their capacity to handle the tasks they have been delegated. I would prioritize the state-level duties related to student financial aid and government funding, recognizing their critical importance to the student body. I would work with my staff to redistribute responsibilities in a way that ensures these crucial tasks are being adequately addressed while also considering their existing workloads and areas of expertise. Additionally, I would explore potential strategies to streamline processes, improve efficiency, and possibly seek additional support or resources to help manage the workload more effectively.
