I would advise Andres to include a brief explanation within the article about the decision to grant the student anonymity. This explanation should emphasize the importance of protecting vulnerable sources from potential harm while still presenting the student's viewpoints objectively. By providing this context, the article can address concerns about transparency and accountability in journalism, demonstrating a commitment to ethical reporting practices. This approach allows for the student's motives and criticisms to be shared without compromising his identity, ensuring a balance between protecting the individual and upholding journalistic integrity.
