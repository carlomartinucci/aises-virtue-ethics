1. Provide Context: Within the article, Andres can include a brief explanation of the decision to grant the student anonymity. This explanation should emphasize the ethical considerations involved, such as protecting vulnerable sources from potential harm, while also acknowledging the importance of accountability in journalism.

By including this context, readers will understand the rationale behind the decision to redact the student's name and the ethical principles guiding the reporting process.

This approach ensures transparency and accountability in journalism while still prioritizing the well-being of the student facing social backlash.
