I would schedule an urgent appointment with the patient to address his concerns about contracting syphilis. During the appointment, I would review his medical records with him to show the negative test results for syphilis and other STDs. I would then explain the medical evidence and reassure him that he does not have syphilis.

To address his volatility, I would discuss coping strategies with him, such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness techniques, to help manage his emotions. I would also explore potential triggers for his anger and work with him to develop a plan to address these triggers proactively.

Additionally, I would involve a social worker or psychologist in the treatment team to provide additional support and interventions. This could include cognitive-behavioral therapy to help him challenge and reframe his beliefs about contracting syphilis.

Finally, I would emphasize the importance of ongoing monitoring and follow-up to ensure that the patient remains engaged with treatment and to address any new concerns or challenges that may arise.
