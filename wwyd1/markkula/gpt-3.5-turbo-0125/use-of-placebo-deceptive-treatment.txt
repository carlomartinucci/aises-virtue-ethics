I would schedule a dedicated appointment with the patient to discuss his concerns about contracting syphilis. During the appointment, I would review his medical records with him to show the negative test results for syphilis and other STDs. I would then explain the medical evidence and reassure him that he does not have syphilis.

I would inquire further about his recent sexual activity and the reasons behind his conflicting statements. This could help uncover any underlying issues or misconceptions that are contributing to his beliefs.

To address his volatility and mistrust, I would validate his feelings and express understanding of his distress. I would emphasize my commitment to his overall well-being and the importance of our therapeutic relationship. I would work collaboratively with him to develop a plan to address his concerns and improve his trust in our treatment approach.

Additionally, I would consider involving a social worker to provide additional support and interventions if needed.
