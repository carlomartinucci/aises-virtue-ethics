I would recommend that the company establish a post-trial care program for the participants in Russia. This program should include continued access to the drug for those who benefited from it during the trial but cannot afford it, as well as access to medical care to monitor their health and provide ongoing support. Additionally, I would suggest collaborating with local healthcare providers in Russia to ensure that the participants receive the necessary follow-up care and support. This approach would help to address the ethical concerns raised by the scenario and demonstrate a commitment to the well-being of the trial participants.
