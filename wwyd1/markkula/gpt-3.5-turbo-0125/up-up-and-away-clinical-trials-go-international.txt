I would recommend that the company establish a post-trial support program for the participants in Russia. This program could include providing continued access to the drug at an affordable cost or for free for those who cannot afford it. Additionally, the company could collaborate with local healthcare providers in Russia to ensure that the participants receive ongoing medical care and support even after the trial has ended. This would help to address the potential negative impact of discontinuing treatment for the participants and ensure that they continue to benefit from the progress made during the trial.
