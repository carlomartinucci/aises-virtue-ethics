I would schedule a meeting with HR, legal, and management to discuss Matt's request for reinstatement following his disclosure of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). During the meeting, I would address the inappropriate comment made by Matt and emphasize the importance of upholding the company's sexual harassment policy. I would propose a plan that includes providing Matt with sensitivity training and counseling to ensure he understands and adheres to appropriate workplace behavior. Additionally, I would work with the team to determine reasonable accommodations for Matt's ASD to support his successful return to work, such as providing clear communication guidelines or assigning a mentor for guidance. By taking these steps, we can address the behavioral issue, support Matt's needs, and create a more inclusive and respectful work environment.
