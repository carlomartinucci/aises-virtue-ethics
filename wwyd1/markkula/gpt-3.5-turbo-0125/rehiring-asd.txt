I would schedule a meeting with Matt to discuss his request for reinstatement and his ASD disclosure. During the meeting, I would address the inappropriate comment he made and emphasize the seriousness of breaching the company's sexual harassment policy. I would provide him with training on appropriate workplace behavior and expectations, tailored to his understanding and communication needs due to his ASD.

I would also involve HR and legal teams to review the situation and determine if there are accommodations that can be made to support Matt in his role. This could include assigning a mentor or coach to provide guidance and feedback, implementing a communication plan to ensure clarity in expectations, and setting up regular check-ins to monitor his progress and address any challenges that may arise.

Additionally, I would communicate with the female employee who reported the incident to ensure that she feels supported and that appropriate measures are in place to prevent similar incidents in the future. It is crucial to create a safe and inclusive work environment for all employees while also providing necessary support and accommodations for individuals with disabilities like ASD.
