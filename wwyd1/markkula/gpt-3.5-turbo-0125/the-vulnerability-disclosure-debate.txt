I would first reach out to both Google and Microsoft to facilitate a meeting between their respective security teams. During this meeting, I would encourage open communication to understand the nature and severity of the vulnerabilities. I would emphasize the importance of collaboration in addressing the vulnerabilities promptly and effectively.

To ensure user safety during the period between vulnerability disclosure and patch release, I would propose a joint statement from both companies acknowledging the vulnerabilities and outlining interim security measures or workarounds that users can implement to mitigate risks. This proactive approach would demonstrate a shared commitment to user safety and security.

Additionally, I would suggest involving independent cybersecurity experts to provide an objective assessment of the vulnerabilities and offer recommendations for mitigation strategies. Their expertise can help validate the severity of the vulnerabilities and guide the development of effective patches.

By fostering collaboration, promoting transparency with users, and leveraging external expertise, we can work towards a resolution that prioritizes user safety, addresses the conflicting disclosure policies, and ultimately strengthens cybersecurity practices within the industry.
