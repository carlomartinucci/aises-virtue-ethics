Tim should firmly refuse to sign the altered agreement and decline the envelope filled with cash from Sam. He should inform Sam that he cannot accept the bribe and that he will not compromise his integrity. Tim should then excuse himself from the meeting and immediately report the incident to his boss and the company's ethics committee.

Upon reporting the attempted bribe, Tim should provide a detailed account of the situation, including the altered agreement and the cash offered by Sam. He should seek guidance from the company's legal department on how to proceed with the deal in a lawful and ethical manner. Tim should also document the entire incident, including any conversations or interactions with Sam, to protect himself and ensure transparency.

To address his financial struggles, Tim should explore legitimate avenues within the company, such as discussing his concerns with HR or seeking financial counseling services provided by the organization. By taking these steps, Tim can uphold his integrity, protect his reputation, and demonstrate his commitment to ethical conduct while also addressing his financial challenges through appropriate channels.
