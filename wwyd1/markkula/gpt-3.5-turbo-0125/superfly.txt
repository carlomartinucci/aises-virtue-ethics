To address potential issues and improve customer satisfaction with the SuperFly VR vacation experience, I would implement the following specific actions:

1. Conduct regular training sessions for smartraVeleR consultants to ensure they are well-versed in all aspects of the VR vacation packages offered. This training should include detailed information on each destination, customization options, and handling customer inquiries effectively.

By providing ongoing training and support to the consultants, we can enhance their knowledge and expertise, ultimately leading to better guidance and assistance for customers in creating their ideal VR vacation experience.
