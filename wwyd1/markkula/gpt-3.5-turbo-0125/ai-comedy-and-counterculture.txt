I would proactively reach out to the George Carlin estate and his daughter to propose the establishment of a formal agreement or licensing process for any future AI-generated content featuring George Carlin's likeness or voice. This agreement would outline the terms and conditions for the use of Carlin's persona in AI-generated projects, ensuring that proper authorization is obtained and the artist's legacy is respected. By collaborating with the estate and family to create a clear framework, we can address the ethical implications of AI-generated content and prevent unauthorized use of Carlin's identity in the future. This proactive approach would help protect the integrity of Carlin's work and ensure that his legacy is preserved in a respectful manner.
