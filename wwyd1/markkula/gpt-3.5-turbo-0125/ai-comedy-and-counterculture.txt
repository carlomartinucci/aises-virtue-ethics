I would initiate direct communication with the George Carlin estate and Carlin's daughter to propose the establishment of a formal agreement or licensing process for any future AI-generated content featuring George Carlin. This agreement would outline the specific terms and conditions under which such content can be created and distributed, ensuring that the family's wishes and the artist's legacy are respected.

Additionally, I would suggest the creation of a dedicated oversight committee comprising representatives from the Carlin estate, industry experts, and AI technology specialists. This committee would be responsible for reviewing and approving any AI-generated content featuring deceased artists before it is released to the public. By involving relevant stakeholders in the decision-making process, we can ensure transparency, accountability, and ethical considerations are prioritized in the creation and distribution of such content.

Furthermore, I would propose the development of industry-wide guidelines or best practices for using AI technology to recreate the works of deceased artists. These guidelines would serve as a framework for creators and platforms to navigate the ethical and legal implications of AI-generated content, promoting responsible and respectful use of technology in the entertainment industry.

By taking these specific actions, we can proactively address the ethical concerns raised by the unauthorized AI-generated content featuring George Carlin and work towards establishing a more ethical and sustainable approach to utilizing AI technology in the creation of content involving deceased artists.
