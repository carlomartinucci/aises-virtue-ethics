I would immediately convene a meeting with the board and key stakeholders to discuss the transition plan following Brendan Eich's resignation. During this meeting, I would outline a clear timeline for appointing an interim CEO and initiating a search for a permanent replacement. I would also establish a communication strategy to address any concerns or questions from employees, contributors, and the wider community.

In terms of policy review, I would prioritize a comprehensive assessment of the organization's diversity and inclusion policies to ensure they align with the values of promoting openness and opportunity on the Web. This review would involve gathering feedback from employees and external experts to identify areas for improvement and implement necessary changes. Additionally, I would conduct training sessions for all employees to reinforce the importance of diversity and inclusion within the organization.

Overall, my focus would be on ensuring a smooth leadership transition, enhancing diversity and inclusion policies, and fostering a culture of openness and respect within the organization.
