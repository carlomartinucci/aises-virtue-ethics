I would schedule a meeting with Jerome to discuss his recent relapse and the circumstances that led to it. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about his well-being and the importance of consistent attendance in the program for successful recovery. I would inquire about his current support system and living situation to understand the challenges he may be facing.

Given Jerome's history and the severity of his addiction, I would recommend exploring alternative treatment options that may better suit his needs, such as intensive outpatient programs or counseling services. I would offer to assist Jerome in finding resources for inpatient treatment, despite the challenges with availability and insurance coverage.

I would also address the one-chance only policy of the program with Jerome, explaining the importance of adhering to program guidelines while also considering his unique circumstances. I would work with Jerome to create a personalized treatment plan that takes into account his past experiences and barriers to treatment, aiming to provide him with the support he needs to succeed in his recovery journey.

Additionally, I would advocate for increased access to treatment resources for all individuals struggling with addiction in the community, regardless of race or background. I would collaborate with community advocates to address any disparities in treatment access and work towards a more equitable response to addiction in the area.
