I would schedule a meeting with Jerome to discuss his recent relapse and the implications of the one-chance only policy of the program. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about his relapse and the importance of consistent attendance for successful recovery. I would also inquire about his current support system and willingness to commit to the program's requirements moving forward.

Given Jerome's history and the severity of his addiction, I would recommend exploring alternative treatment options, such as intensive outpatient programs or counseling services that may provide more support and structure than the current program. I would also offer to assist Jerome in finding resources for inpatient treatment, despite the challenges with availability and insurance coverage.

I would address the one-chance only policy directly with Jerome, explaining the rationale behind it and the importance of accountability in the program. I would discuss the possibility of a probationary period where Jerome would need to demonstrate a renewed commitment to the program through consistent attendance and active participation in therapy sessions.

Additionally, I would advocate for increased access to treatment resources for all individuals in the community, regardless of race or background, and work towards addressing systemic barriers to care. I would collaborate with community advocates to ensure that marginalized populations, such as the African-American community, receive equitable access to addiction treatment services.

Overall, by combining individualized care with adherence to program guidelines and advocating for systemic change, I aim to support Jerome in his recovery journey while promoting fairness and inclusivity in the treatment process.
