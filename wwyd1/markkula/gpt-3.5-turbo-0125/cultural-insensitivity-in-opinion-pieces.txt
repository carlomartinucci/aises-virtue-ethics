I would suggest that Jennifer schedule a meeting with Ishmael to discuss her concerns about the potential cultural insensitivity in his article about boba. During the meeting, Jennifer could explain the cultural significance of boba to many students at their school and how Ishmael's language may be perceived as disrespectful or offensive to some readers. Jennifer could then propose specific revisions to Ishmael's article, such as replacing the comparison of boba tapioca to "frog eyes rolling in your mouth" with a more neutral description that focuses on taste and texture without using culturally insensitive imagery. Additionally, Jennifer could offer to collaborate with Ishmael on editing his article to ensure that it respects cultural differences and fosters a more inclusive dialogue about boba within the school community.
