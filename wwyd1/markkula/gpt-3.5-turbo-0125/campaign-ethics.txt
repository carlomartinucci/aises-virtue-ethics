In Olivia's position, I would first schedule a meeting with the current ASI president or another senior member of the organization to discuss my concerns about the timing of implementing the initiatives for the Community Relations Branch in relation to my upcoming campaign for ASI president. During the meeting, I would propose the idea of forming a committee to oversee the planning and execution of the events, ensuring that decisions are made collectively and transparently.

Additionally, I would suggest creating a detailed timeline for the events and initiatives, with clear milestones and checkpoints to monitor progress. This timeline would be shared with all ASI members to ensure accountability and fairness in the planning process.

Furthermore, I would consider involving external stakeholders, such as faculty members or student representatives, in the decision-making process to provide an external perspective and ensure that the initiatives benefit the entire student body, rather than just serving as a campaign strategy.

Overall, by involving key stakeholders, creating a transparent decision-making process, and establishing clear guidelines for the planning of events, I would aim to address the ethical concerns raised by the potential overlap between Olivia's current role and her future campaign for ASI president.
