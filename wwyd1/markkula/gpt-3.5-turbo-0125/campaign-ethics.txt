In Olivia's position, I would first schedule a meeting with the current ASI president or a senior advisor to discuss the timeline of the upcoming election and seek guidance on how to navigate the situation ethically. During this meeting, I would openly share my concerns about potentially using my current role for personal gain and ask for advice on how to proceed in a fair and transparent manner.

Additionally, I would propose a plan to the ASI leadership team that outlines the initiatives and events I have planned for the Community Relations Branch. I would suggest adjusting the timing of these activities to ensure they are implemented based on their merit and impact on the student body, rather than for the purpose of boosting my campaign. This could involve spreading out the events throughout the year or collaborating with other ASI members to ensure a balanced approach.

Furthermore, I would communicate with my fellow ASI members about my intentions and seek their input on how to best showcase the positive impact of the initiatives without creating an unfair advantage for my campaign. By fostering open dialogue and collaboration within the team, I can demonstrate my commitment to ethical leadership and transparency in my actions.

Overall, by seeking guidance from mentors, proposing a transparent plan to ASI leadership, and involving colleagues in the decision-making process, I can navigate the situation ethically and ensure that my actions align with the values of the student government organization.
