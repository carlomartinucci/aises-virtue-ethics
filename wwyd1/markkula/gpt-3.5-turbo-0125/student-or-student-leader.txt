To address the conflict of the two senators missing Senate meetings due to class schedules, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Proxy Selection Process:
- Work closely with the junior senator to identify a suitable proxy who can attend Senate meetings on their behalf.
- Develop a clear set of criteria for selecting the proxy, focusing on qualities such as reliability, communication skills, and understanding of the constituents' concerns.
- Organize a meeting with the potential proxies to explain their role, responsibilities, and expectations in representing the junior senator during Senate meetings.
- Ensure that the selected proxy receives thorough briefings before each meeting to stay informed and effectively convey the junior senator's perspectives.

By implementing a structured proxy selection process and providing adequate support and guidance to the chosen proxy, we can ensure that the concerns of the constituents are still represented in Senate meetings despite the junior senator's class schedule constraints.
