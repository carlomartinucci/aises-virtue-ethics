To address the conflict of the senators missing Senate meetings due to class schedules, I would take the following steps:

1. Meet with the junior senator to discuss the possibility of appointing a proxy to attend Senate meetings on their behalf. I would work with the senator to identify a responsible and knowledgeable proxy who can effectively represent their constituents and provide updates on discussions and votes.

2. Propose a temporary adjustment to the attendance policy to the Senate. I would outline the specific circumstances of the senators' class schedules and the proposed solution of appointing proxies to ensure that the concerns of the constituents are still represented. I would emphasize the importance of supporting the senators' academic commitments while maintaining the integrity of the student government.

3. Communicate the adjusted attendance policy to all Senate members and ensure that the process for appointing proxies is clear and transparent. I would provide guidelines for selecting proxies and establish a system for reporting back to the senators on meeting discussions and decisions.

By implementing these steps, we can ensure that the senators can fulfill their academic requirements while still actively participating in student government activities, maintaining accountability to their constituents, and upholding the integrity of the organization.
