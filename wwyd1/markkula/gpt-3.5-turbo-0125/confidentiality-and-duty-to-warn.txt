I would immediately address the client's expressed desire to stalk Susan and her new boyfriend by discussing the potential legal and ethical implications of such behavior. I would emphasize the importance of respecting others' boundaries and privacy, and work with the client to develop alternative coping strategies for managing his feelings of rejection and jealousy. Additionally, I would explore the client's support system and consider involving other mental health professionals or support groups to provide additional assistance and ensure the client's safety and well-being.
