I would immediately address the client's expressed desire to stalk Susan and her new boyfriend by clearly stating that such behavior is unacceptable and illegal. I would educate the client on the potential consequences of stalking, including legal repercussions and harm to Susan and her boyfriend. I would work with the client to develop a safety plan to prevent him from acting on these impulses, such as setting boundaries around contact with Susan and practicing healthy coping strategies when feeling rejected or jealous. I would also explore the underlying reasons for the client's feelings of rejection and inadequacy, and work on building his self-esteem and self-worth through therapy techniques such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. Additionally, I would involve other mental health professionals or support systems as needed to ensure the client's safety and well-being.
