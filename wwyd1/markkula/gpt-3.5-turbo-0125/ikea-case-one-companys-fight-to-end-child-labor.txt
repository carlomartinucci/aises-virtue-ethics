One specific action that IKEA can take to address the issue of child labor in its supply chain is to establish a comprehensive supplier monitoring program. This program should involve regular on-site visits to supplier factories in high-risk countries to ensure compliance with ethical standards, including the prohibition of child labor.

IKEA can assign a dedicated team of trained auditors to conduct these visits and inspections. The auditors should be well-versed in identifying signs of child labor and should have the authority to take immediate action if any violations are found. Additionally, IKEA can collaborate with local NGOs and labor rights organizations to enhance the effectiveness of these monitoring efforts.

By implementing a robust supplier monitoring program, IKEA can proactively address the issue of child labor in its supply chain and demonstrate a strong commitment to ethical sourcing practices. This action will help ensure that suppliers adhere to the company's code of conduct and uphold the rights of workers, particularly children, in the production process.
