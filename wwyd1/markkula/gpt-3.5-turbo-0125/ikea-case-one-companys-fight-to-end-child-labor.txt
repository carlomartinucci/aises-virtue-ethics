To address the issue of child labor in its supply chain, IKEA should take the following specific action:

Establish a dedicated Child Labor Monitoring Unit within the company that is responsible for conducting regular on-site visits to supplier factories in high-risk countries. This unit should consist of trained professionals who specialize in identifying and addressing instances of child labor. They should work closely with local NGOs and labor rights organizations to verify compliance with ethical sourcing standards.

By creating a specialized team focused solely on monitoring child labor, IKEA can ensure a more targeted and effective approach to addressing this critical issue. The team's regular visits to supplier factories will help verify compliance with the supplier code of conduct and provide an opportunity to identify and address any instances of child labor promptly. Collaborating with external organizations will also enhance IKEA's ability to tackle the root causes of child labor and implement sustainable solutions.

This concrete action will demonstrate IKEA's commitment to eradicating child labor from its supply chain and help uphold ethical sourcing practices. By investing in a dedicated Child Labor Monitoring Unit, IKEA can proactively address the issue, protect vulnerable workers, and uphold its reputation as a socially responsible company.
