I would propose the following concrete actions to address the ethical concerns surrounding the use of AI-detection tools in educational settings:

1. Establish a diverse task force comprising educators, students, AI experts, and academic integrity officers to review the existing AI-detection tools and their impact on students, especially non-native English speakers.

2. Conduct a thorough evaluation of the AI-detection tools currently in use in educational institutions to identify patterns of false positives and false negatives, with a focus on understanding how these errors affect students' academic integrity.

3. Develop a set of clear guidelines for the responsible implementation of AI-detection tools, emphasizing the importance of using these tools as supplementary measures rather than sole determinants of academic misconduct.

4. Collaborate with AI developers and researchers to enhance the accuracy and reliability of AI-detection tools, particularly in identifying text produced by non-native English speakers, through targeted training data and algorithm improvements.

5. Implement regular training sessions for educators and academic integrity officers on the nuances of AI-detection tools, including how to interpret results, address false positives, and support students who may be wrongly flagged for plagiarism.

6. Establish a feedback mechanism for students to report instances of unfair treatment or misidentification by AI-detection tools, ensuring that their concerns are addressed promptly and transparently.

7. Advocate for the continuous monitoring and evaluation of AI-detection tools in educational settings, with a focus on improving their performance and minimizing biases that may disproportionately impact certain student populations.

By taking these specific actions, we aim to promote fairness, transparency, and accountability in the use of AI-detection tools, ultimately safeguarding the academic integrity and well-being of all students in educational institutions.
