I would recommend Derek to organize a town hall meeting or open forum where students can directly voice their concerns and experiences related to the recent targeted thefts affecting off-campus fraternities and sororities. This platform would allow students to express their perspectives authentically and without filtering. Derek can then compile the feedback and present it to the Vice Provost, emphasizing the importance of addressing these issues to maintain student trust and engagement. By providing a direct channel for student input, Derek can ensure that their voices are heard while also demonstrating transparency and accountability in his role as a student leader.
