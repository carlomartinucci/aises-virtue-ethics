I would advise Derek to propose the creation of a student advisory board that includes representatives from various student groups, including off-campus Greek life organizations. This board would serve as a direct channel for student voices to be heard by the administration. Derek can present this idea to the Vice Provost as a way to ensure authentic student representation while also aligning with the administration's goals of student engagement and support.

Additionally, Derek should schedule a meeting with the Vice Provost to discuss the recent incidents involving off-campus Greek life and emphasize the importance of addressing these issues to maintain student trust in the Associated Students. By presenting the concerns of the affected students in a respectful and constructive manner, Derek can demonstrate his commitment to advocating for student needs while also seeking collaboration with the administration.

Furthermore, Derek could suggest organizing a campus-wide forum or town hall meeting to openly discuss the challenges faced by off-campus Greek life organizations and explore potential solutions. This public dialogue can help raise awareness, foster understanding, and encourage collective problem-solving among students, faculty, and administrators.

By taking these specific actions, Derek can navigate the delicate balance between representing student interests authentically and maintaining a positive relationship with the administration, ultimately working towards addressing the concerns of off-campus Greek life while upholding the integrity of his role as President of the Associated Students.
