I would thank the donor for their interest in supporting the university and express appreciation for their desire to give back to the community. I would kindly request more information from the donor about their specific role and involvement during their time at the financial group, particularly in relation to the predatory lending practices.

I would consult with the university's fundraising team and leadership to discuss the situation further. As part of due diligence, I would research the donor's background, including any public information or news articles related to their time at the financial group. I would also seek advice from the university's ethics committee to evaluate the potential implications of accepting donations from this donor.

Based on the information gathered and the advice received, I would engage in a transparent and honest conversation with the donor. I would explain the university's commitment to ethical fundraising practices and the importance of ensuring that donations align with the university's values. Depending on the outcome of the due diligence process and discussions with the ethics committee, a decision would be made regarding whether to accept the donation and under what conditions.

Throughout the process, I would prioritize transparency, integrity, and ethical considerations to ensure that the university upholds its values while also considering the potential impact of accepting donations from the donor associated with the financial group's controversial past.
