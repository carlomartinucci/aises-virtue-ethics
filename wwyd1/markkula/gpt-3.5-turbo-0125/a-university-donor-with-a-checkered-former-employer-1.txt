I would thank the donor for their interest in supporting the university and express appreciation for their desire to give back to the community. I would kindly request more information from the donor about their specific role and involvement during their time at the financial group to better understand their perspective and intentions.

After gathering more details, I would consult with the university's fundraising team and leadership to discuss the situation. I would propose conducting due diligence on the donor's background to verify their level of involvement in the controversial practices of the financial group. This due diligence process may involve researching public records, news articles, and any available information to assess the donor's connection to the unethical practices.

Based on the findings from the due diligence process and discussions with the fundraising team and leadership, a decision would be made regarding whether to accept the donation. If the donor's involvement in the unethical practices is confirmed to be minimal or non-existent, and their intention to support the university's mission aligns with our values, we may consider accepting the donation. However, if there are significant concerns about the donor's past actions or if their values do not align with the university's commitment to diversity and inclusion, we may respectfully decline the donation.

Throughout the process, clear communication with the donor is essential. I would ensure transparency in explaining the decision-making process and the reasons behind the final decision, maintaining professionalism and respect in all interactions with the donor.
