I would have a detailed discussion with the patient about the urgent need for intervention due to the developmental risks posed by continued heroin use during pregnancy. I would explain the potential consequences of delayed treatment and the importance of taking immediate steps to protect the health and well-being of both the mother and the fetus.

I would emphasize the benefits of accessing the inpatient drug treatment program that provides medically-supported heroin withdrawal for both the mother and the fetus. I would highlight the advantages of this program, such as specialized care and monitoring to ensure the safety of the pregnancy and the effectiveness of the treatment.

I would offer to assist the patient in accessing the inpatient treatment program and provide ongoing support and guidance throughout the process. I would ensure that she understands the gravity of the situation and the need for prompt action to mitigate the risks associated with continued heroin use during pregnancy.

Additionally, I would collaborate with other healthcare professionals and social services to create a comprehensive care plan for the patient, addressing her medical, social, and emotional needs throughout the treatment process. I would prioritize the well-being of both the mother and the fetus while respecting the patient's autonomy and providing her with the necessary support to make informed decisions about her treatment options.
