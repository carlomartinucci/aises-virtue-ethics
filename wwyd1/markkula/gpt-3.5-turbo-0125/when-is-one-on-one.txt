I would recommend setting up a multidisciplinary meeting involving Kyle's parents, his doctor, and the staff at Eminent Scholars to create a comprehensive support plan tailored to Kyle's needs. This plan would include a structured approach to social skills development within the school setting, such as incorporating group projects and extracurricular activities that promote teamwork and communication. Additionally, I would suggest exploring external resources, such as therapy or social skills groups, to complement the support provided by the school and ensure Kyle's holistic development is addressed. Regular check-ins and progress reviews would be scheduled to assess Kyle's well-being and academic progress, allowing for adjustments to be made as needed. This collaborative and proactive approach would ensure that Kyle receives the necessary support to thrive academically and socially at Eminent Scholars.
