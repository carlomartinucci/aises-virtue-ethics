To further enhance the response to the scenario, I would recommend that Hana consult with mental health professionals or campus counselors before proceeding with the article. By seeking guidance from experts in the field of mental health, Hana can ensure that her reporting is not only sensitive but also informed by best practices in suicide prevention and mental health awareness.

Additionally, Hana should consider interviewing individuals who were close to the student to gather insights into his life, achievements, and struggles with mental health. This approach would help humanize the student, provide a more nuanced perspective on his experiences, and emphasize the importance of seeking help when facing mental health challenges.

Furthermore, Hana could collaborate with campus mental health organizations to include information about available resources and support services in her article. By partnering with these organizations, Hana can amplify the message of mental health awareness and encourage students to prioritize their well-being.

Overall, by taking these specific actions, Hana can ensure that her coverage of the student's death is not only respectful and responsible but also contributes positively to the campus dialogue on mental health.
