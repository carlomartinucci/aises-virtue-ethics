I would advise Hana to consult with mental health professionals or campus counselors for guidance on how to approach the topic sensitively. They can provide valuable insights on how to cover the story in a way that minimizes harm and promotes mental health awareness effectively. Additionally, Hana should consider interviewing friends, faculty, and staff who knew the student well to gather insights on his life, contributions, and struggles with depression. By sharing personal stories and memories, Hana can create a more nuanced and respectful tribute to the student's memory.
