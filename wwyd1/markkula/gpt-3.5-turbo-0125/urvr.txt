To further enhance user privacy and data protection in the scenario described, I would implement a two-step verification process for users to confirm their consent before sharing any 360 degree videos or images. This would involve requiring users to confirm their intent to share the content after the initial capture, ensuring that they are fully aware of the implications of sharing such immersive moments. Additionally, I would introduce a feature that allows users to set specific privacy settings for each piece of content, giving them control over who can access and view their shared moments. This personalized approach would empower users to make informed decisions about their privacy preferences and enhance the overall trust and transparency of the platform.
