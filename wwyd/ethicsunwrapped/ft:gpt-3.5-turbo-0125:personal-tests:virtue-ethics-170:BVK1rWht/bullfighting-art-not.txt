I would conduct a thorough investigation into the treatment of the bulls in bullfighting, including their living conditions, handling, and the actual process of the fight itself. I would gather data from various sources, such as animal welfare organizations, veterinarians, and experts in bullfighting, to get a comprehensive understanding of the impact on the animals involved. Based on the findings, I would work with stakeholders, including bullfighters, animal rights activists, and local authorities, to propose and implement specific measures to improve the welfare of the bulls in bullfighting, ensuring that any changes are feasible and effective in addressing the concerns raised.
