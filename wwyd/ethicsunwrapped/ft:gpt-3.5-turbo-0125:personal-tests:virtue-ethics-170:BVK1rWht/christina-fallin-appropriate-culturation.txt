I would reach out to Christina Fallin and Pink Pony to schedule a meeting or video call to discuss the situation. During the conversation, I would express understanding of their artistic intentions but also highlight the concerns raised by the Native American community regarding cultural appropriation. I would suggest collaborating with Native American artists or cultural experts to gain a deeper understanding of the significance of headdresses and other cultural symbols. Additionally, I would propose organizing a cultural sensitivity workshop for the band members to educate them on the importance of respecting and honoring diverse cultures in their artistic expression.
