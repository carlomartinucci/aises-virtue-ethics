I would approach Mary after the fundraising dinner and express my concerns about the misperception that Robert had regarding the shelter's clientele. I would suggest that it is important to be transparent and accurate when discussing Casa Tia Maria's mission and the population it serves. I would recommend that in future interactions with donors, we should make sure to clarify the nature of the shelter's work and the demographics of the individuals being helped to avoid any misunderstandings or misrepresentations.
