I would consult with a supervisor or a colleague who is experienced in ethical decision-making in social work to discuss the situation and seek guidance on how to proceed. I would present the details of the case, including my concerns about my own biases and the potential impact on the client's treatment. Together, we would explore potential options for addressing the conflict between my religious beliefs and the ethical duty to provide unbiased care to the client. This consultation would help me gain perspective and consider alternative courses of action that prioritize the client's well-being while also respecting my own beliefs.
