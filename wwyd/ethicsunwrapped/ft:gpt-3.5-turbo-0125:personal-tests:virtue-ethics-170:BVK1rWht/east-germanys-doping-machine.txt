I would report the systematic doping program in the GDR to relevant international sports authorities, such as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). I would provide detailed information about the secret law mandating the use of performance-enhancing drugs, the specific drugs administered to athletes, and the adverse effects experienced by the athletes as a result of the doping program. Additionally, I would offer to testify or provide evidence to support any investigations into the matter.
