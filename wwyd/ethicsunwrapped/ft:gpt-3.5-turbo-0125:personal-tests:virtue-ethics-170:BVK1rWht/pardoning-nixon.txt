I would have advised President Ford to consult with a diverse group of legal experts, constitutional scholars, and political advisors to thoroughly analyze the potential consequences and implications of issuing a pardon to Nixon. This would involve a detailed examination of the legal basis for the pardon, the public perception of such an action, and the long-term impact on the credibility of the presidency and the rule of law. Additionally, I would recommend conducting a thorough review of Nixon's health condition to ensure that the decision is not influenced by inaccurate information or assumptions about his prognosis. Finally, I would suggest engaging in open and transparent communication with the American public to explain the rationale behind the pardon and address any concerns or criticisms that may arise.
