I would first ensure that the student's privacy is protected by not publicly sharing any identifying information about her in the video or in any subsequent discussions. I would then privately address the student's cyberbullying behavior with her parents and school administrators to develop a plan for education and support to prevent future incidents. Additionally, I would provide resources and guidance to the student on how to express her feelings in a constructive and respectful manner.
