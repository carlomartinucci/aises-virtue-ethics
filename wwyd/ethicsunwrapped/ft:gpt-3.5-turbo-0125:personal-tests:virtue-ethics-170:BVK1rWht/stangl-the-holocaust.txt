I would ensure that Franz Stangl is held accountable for his actions by providing all necessary evidence and testimony during his trial to ensure a fair and just legal process. This includes presenting witness testimonies, documents, and any other relevant information to prove his direct involvement and responsibility in the mass murders at the killing centers he oversaw. Additionally, I would work with legal experts to counter Stangl's defense claims and arguments, highlighting the gravity of his actions and the impact they had on the victims and their families. Finally, I would support efforts to ensure that justice is served by advocating for the maximum penalty of life in prison for Stangl's crimes against humanity.
