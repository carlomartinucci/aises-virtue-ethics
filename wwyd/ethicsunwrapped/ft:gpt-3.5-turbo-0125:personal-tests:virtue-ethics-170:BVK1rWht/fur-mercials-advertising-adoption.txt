I would express concern about the approach taken by R&R Partners in developing the "In-FUR-mercial" campaign. I would schedule a meeting with the agency's leadership to discuss the potential ethical implications of framing pet adoption as a humorous and utilitarian choice rather than emphasizing the emotional bond between pets and their owners. I would suggest conducting additional research to understand the impact of such messaging on the public perception of pet adoption and the Animal Foundation's mission. Additionally, I would propose exploring alternative strategies that prioritize the well-being of the animals and align more closely with the values of the shelter and its supporters.
