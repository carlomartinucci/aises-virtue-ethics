I would first meet with the assistant principal who observed the lesson to understand her perspective and reasoning behind demanding that Barron stop the video. I would listen to her concerns and discuss the impact of the lesson on the students. Next, I would meet with Alan Barron to discuss the incident, review the content of his lesson, and provide guidance on how to approach sensitive topics in a culturally appropriate manner. I would also work with Barron to develop strategies for addressing potentially controversial material in the future to ensure that all students feel respected and included in the learning environment. Finally, I would communicate with the school community, including parents and students, to address any concerns and clarify the steps taken to address the situation.
