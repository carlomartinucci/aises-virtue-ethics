I would report Andrew Wakefield's unethical behavior to the appropriate medical authorities, such as the General Medical Council, providing all the evidence and documentation I have gathered regarding his conflicts of interest, manipulation of research data, failure to disclose funding sources, and unethical practices in conducting the study. I would also cooperate fully with any investigations or inquiries that may be launched as a result of the report. Additionally, I would work to ensure that accurate information about the safety and importance of vaccines is disseminated to counteract the misinformation spread by Wakefield.
