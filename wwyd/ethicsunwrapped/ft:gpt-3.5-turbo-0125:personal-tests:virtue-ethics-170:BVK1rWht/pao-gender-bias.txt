I would review the performance reviews and evaluations of Ellen Pao to understand the specific criticisms and feedback she received each year. This would help me assess the consistency of the negative feedback she received and determine if there were any discrepancies or biases in the evaluation process. Additionally, I would analyze the evidence presented by both Pao's legal team and Kleiner Perkins to evaluate the validity of the claims made by each party. This analysis would provide me with a clearer understanding of the factors that influenced the jury's decision and help identify any potential areas for improvement in addressing gender discrimination and retaliation within the company.
