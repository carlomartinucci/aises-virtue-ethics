I would immediately report the clerk's email admitting to gaming the system to my supervisor or a higher authority within the hospital. I would provide any evidence I have, such as the email itself, to support my report. I would also offer to assist in any investigations that may be conducted to uncover the extent of the manipulation of wait time data. Additionally, I would ensure that accurate wait time data is being recorded and reported moving forward to prioritize the timely and appropriate care of our veterans.
