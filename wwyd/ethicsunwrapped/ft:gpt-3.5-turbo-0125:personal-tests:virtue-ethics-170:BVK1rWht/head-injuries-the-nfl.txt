I would recommend that the NFL continues to invest in research to better understand the long-term effects of playing football on brain health. This research should focus on identifying risk factors for concussions and CTE, as well as developing improved diagnostic tools to detect these conditions earlier. Additionally, the NFL should work with medical professionals to establish clear guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of concussions, as well as protocols for safely returning players to the field after a head injury. By taking these steps, the NFL can demonstrate a commitment to player safety and work towards minimizing the risks associated with playing football.
