I would ensure that all co-authors of the retracted article are informed about the legal proceedings and the court's decision to dismiss the case. This would involve sending out a detailed email or holding a meeting to discuss the outcome, address any concerns or questions, and provide support to the co-authors who may have been affected by the lawsuit. Additionally, I would offer guidance on how to navigate any potential repercussions on their own careers or reputations within the scientific community.
