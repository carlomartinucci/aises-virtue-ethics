I would conduct research to gather data and information on the impact of prenatal testing bans on abortion, specifically focusing on the experiences and perspectives of individuals and families affected by Down syndrome. This research would involve studying medical outcomes, societal implications, and ethical considerations related to such bans. Additionally, I would seek to understand the legal frameworks and precedents in other countries that have addressed similar issues, such as the ruling in Britain's Court of Appeal. This research would provide a comprehensive understanding of the complexities surrounding the issue and help inform potential policy recommendations or advocacy efforts.
