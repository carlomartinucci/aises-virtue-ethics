I would immediately report the information provided by the graduate assistant coach, Mike McQueary, to the appropriate authorities, such as the police or child protective services. This would ensure that the allegations of sexual abuse by Jerry Sandusky are properly investigated and that steps are taken to protect any potential victims. Additionally, I would cooperate fully with any investigations and provide all relevant information and evidence to assist in the prosecution of those responsible for the crimes.
