I would review the details of the case, including the actions and statements made by all parties involved, to understand the full context of the situation. I would then consult with legal experts within the CIA and the Department of Justice to determine if there are any further legal avenues to pursue in response to the pardon of Libby by President Trump. Additionally, I would work with CIA leadership to assess and address any potential risks to the safety of covert operatives and the operations of the CIA resulting from the pardon. Finally, I would consider engaging in public advocacy efforts to raise awareness about the implications of the pardon on national security and the importance of protecting covert operatives.
