I would first ensure that the safety and well-being of all students involved in the protests are prioritized. This includes working with campus security and local law enforcement to prevent any escalation of tensions or violence. I would also facilitate open dialogues between the student protesters, university administrators, and faculty members to address the underlying issues of racial discrimination and create a platform for constructive discussions and resolutions. Additionally, I would collaborate with relevant campus departments to provide support and resources for students of color who may be feeling marginalized or unsafe on campus.
