I would immediately reach out to Rashon Nelson, Donte Robinson, and Andrew Yaffe to offer a sincere apology on behalf of Starbucks for the unjust treatment they experienced at the Philadelphia location. I would express deep regret for the incident and assure them that their voices are being heard and their concerns are being taken seriously. I would also offer to meet with them in person to discuss how Starbucks can make amends and prevent similar situations from happening in the future. Additionally, I would provide them with a direct line of communication to address any further issues or feedback they may have.
