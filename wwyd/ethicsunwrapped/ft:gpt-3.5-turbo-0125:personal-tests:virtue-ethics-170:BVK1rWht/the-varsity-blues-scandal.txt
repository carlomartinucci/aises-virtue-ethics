I would immediately report Rick Singer's fraudulent activities to the appropriate authorities, such as the FBI or the Department of Justice, providing them with all the evidence and information I have regarding his schemes. I would also offer my full cooperation in the investigation to ensure that justice is served and that those involved in the illegal activities are held accountable for their actions. Additionally, I would reach out to the affected colleges and universities to inform them of the fraudulent admissions facilitated by Singer, so they can take appropriate actions to rectify the situation and uphold the integrity of their admissions processes.
