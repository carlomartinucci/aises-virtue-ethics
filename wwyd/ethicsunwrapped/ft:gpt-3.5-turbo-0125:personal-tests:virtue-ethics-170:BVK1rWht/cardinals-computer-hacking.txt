I would immediately report Chris Correa's actions to the appropriate authorities within the St. Louis Cardinals organization and provide them with all the evidence I have regarding his unauthorized access and theft of information from the Houston Astros. I would also cooperate fully with any investigations conducted by the FBI or other law enforcement agencies to ensure that justice is served and the integrity of the sport is upheld. Additionally, I would support any disciplinary actions taken by Major League Baseball against Correa and the Cardinals to demonstrate that such unethical behavior will not be tolerated in the industry.
