I would convene a meeting with the hospital staff involved in the patient's care, including the medical team, the patient's son who is the guardian, and any relevant mental health professionals. During the meeting, I would facilitate a discussion to explore alternative options for administering the new drug to the patient. This would involve considering the patient's autonomy and the importance of informed consent, as well as the potential benefits and risks of the proposed method of administration. I would encourage open communication and collaboration among the team members to find a solution that respects the patient's rights while also addressing the clinical needs and goals of the treatment plan.
