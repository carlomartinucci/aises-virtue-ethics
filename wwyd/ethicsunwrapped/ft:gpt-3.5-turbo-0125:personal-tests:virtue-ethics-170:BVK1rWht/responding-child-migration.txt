I would work to ensure that the emergency funding allocated by the Obama administration is effectively utilized to provide adequate shelter, food, and medical care for the unaccompanied minors who have entered the country. I would collaborate with local communities and organizations to establish temporary housing facilities and support services to meet the immediate needs of these vulnerable children. Additionally, I would advocate for the expedited processing of asylum claims to ensure that those who are eligible for refugee status receive the necessary legal protection and support.
