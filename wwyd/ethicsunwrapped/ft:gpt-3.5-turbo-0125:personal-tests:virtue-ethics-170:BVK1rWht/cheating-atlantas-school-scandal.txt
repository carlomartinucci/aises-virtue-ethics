I would not change the students' answers on the standardized tests, even if pressured to do so by the principal or other teachers. Instead, I would document the concerns about potential cheating and report them to the appropriate authorities, such as the school district superintendent or the state education department. I would also seek guidance from a trusted mentor or professional organization for advice on how to address the situation while prioritizing the students' best interests and maintaining academic integrity.
