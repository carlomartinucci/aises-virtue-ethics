I would conduct a thorough review of the research protocols and procedures at Heidelberg University and Wayne State University to ensure that all ethical guidelines and regulations regarding the use of human subjects in research were followed. This would involve examining the consent process for obtaining cadavers, the justification for using human cadavers over alternative methods, and the measures taken to ensure the dignity and respect of the deceased individuals. Additionally, I would assess the transparency of the research institutions in communicating their methods and results to the public, as well as the potential impact of the research on improving car safety standards.
