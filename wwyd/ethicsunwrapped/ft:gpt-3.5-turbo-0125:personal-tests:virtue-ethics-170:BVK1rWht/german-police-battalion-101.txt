I would conduct further research into the specific circumstances and psychological factors that influenced the decisions of the reserve policemen in Reserve Police Battalion 101. This research could involve studying additional historical documents, interviewing survivors or descendants of the battalion members, and consulting with experts in psychology and sociology to gain a deeper understanding of the group dynamics and individual motivations at play. By uncovering more details about the context in which these men made their choices, I could contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complexities surrounding their participation in the mass killings.
