I would carefully review the guidelines and policies set by the news organization I work for regarding reporting on suicides. I would also consider the feedback and concerns raised by Robin Williams's fans, mental health professionals, and members of the public regarding the detailed reporting of his suicide. Based on this information, I would make a decision on how much detail to include in my reporting, ensuring that I strike a balance between providing accurate information to the public and respecting the privacy and dignity of the deceased and their family.
