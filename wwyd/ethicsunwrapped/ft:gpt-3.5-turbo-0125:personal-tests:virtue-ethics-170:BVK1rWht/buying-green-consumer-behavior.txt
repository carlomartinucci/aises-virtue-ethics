I would conduct further research to better understand the phenomenon of moral licensing in consumer behavior. This could involve designing experiments to explore the conditions under which purchasing green products leads to indulgent or unethical behaviors. By gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms at play, we can develop strategies to mitigate the negative effects of moral licensing and promote more consistent ethical behavior among consumers.
