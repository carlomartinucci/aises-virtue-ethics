I would immediately report the lack of disclosure by John Gellene to the appropriate authorities within the legal system, including the bankruptcy court and the state bar association. I would provide all relevant information and evidence to support the claim that Gellene failed to disclose the potential conflicts of interest involving Milbank Tweed's representation of both South Street and Mikael Salovaara. Additionally, I would cooperate fully with any investigations or inquiries that may arise from this disclosure to ensure that justice is served and the integrity of the legal profession is upheld.
