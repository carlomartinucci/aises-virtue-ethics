I would work towards raising awareness about the importance of the Paris climate agreement and the need for more ambitious actions to combat climate change. This could involve organizing educational events, writing articles, and engaging with policymakers to advocate for stronger commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, I would collaborate with environmental organizations and other stakeholders to push for concrete steps to hold countries accountable for meeting their targets and to encourage public support for climate action.
