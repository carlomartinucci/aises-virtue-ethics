I would publicly advocate for the exoneration of the Central Park 5 and highlight the overwhelming evidence of their innocence, including the DNA match to Matias Reyes. I would work with legal experts and advocacy groups to raise awareness about the case and push for accountability for those who were involved in wrongfully convicting the young men. Additionally, I would support efforts to reform the criminal justice system to prevent similar miscarriages of justice in the future.
