I would work closely with the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) to develop and implement stricter measures to prevent cheating in the classification system. This could involve conducting more thorough and frequent evaluations of athletes, implementing surprise checks to ensure athletes are not manipulating their disabilities, and increasing penalties for those found guilty of cheating. Additionally, I would collaborate with other countries and organizations to share best practices and create a unified approach to combat cheating in Paralympic sports.
