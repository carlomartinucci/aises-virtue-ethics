I would report the Astros' sign-stealing scheme to the appropriate authorities within Major League Baseball, providing all the evidence and information I have gathered on the matter. This would include details on how the scheme was carried out, who was involved, and the impact it had on the game. I would cooperate fully with any investigation and provide any additional assistance needed to ensure that the integrity of the sport is upheld and that appropriate actions are taken against those responsible for the cheating.
