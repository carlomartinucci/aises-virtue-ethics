I would advise Albert Snyder to seek support from mental health professionals to help him cope with the emotional distress caused by the Westboro Baptist Church's actions. Additionally, I would suggest exploring support groups or counseling services specifically for individuals who have experienced similar situations to find a sense of community and understanding. It may also be beneficial for Albert to engage in activities that promote self-care and well-being to help him navigate the challenging emotions he is experiencing.
