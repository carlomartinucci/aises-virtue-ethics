I would acknowledge the complexity of the situation and the importance of addressing drug addiction as a public health issue. I would also emphasize the need for compassion and support for individuals struggling with addiction, including Rush Limbaugh. I would advocate for a comprehensive approach that combines legal consequences for illegal activities with access to treatment and rehabilitation services for those in need. Additionally, I would encourage open and honest discussions about addiction to reduce stigma and promote understanding within society.
