I would advise Shepard Fairey to ensure that he obtains proper permission and licensing for any future use of copyrighted material in his artwork to avoid potential legal issues and disputes. This would involve conducting thorough research to identify the copyright holders of any images or objects he wishes to appropriate, reaching out to them to request permission for use, and negotiating any necessary licensing agreements to ensure that he is in compliance with copyright laws. Additionally, I would recommend that Fairey consult with legal experts specializing in intellectual property to guide him through the process and ensure that he is fully informed of his rights and responsibilities as an artist.
