I would advise Rashard Mendenhall to carefully consider the potential impact of his social media posts before sharing them. Specifically, I would recommend that he take the time to reflect on the sensitivity of certain topics, such as the death of Osama Bin Laden, and how his words could be interpreted by a wide audience. Additionally, I would suggest that he consult with a public relations professional or a member of his management team before posting controversial statements to ensure that his message is clear and respectful.
