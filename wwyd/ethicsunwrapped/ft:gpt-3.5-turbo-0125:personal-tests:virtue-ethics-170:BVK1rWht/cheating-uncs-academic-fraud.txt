I would conduct a thorough investigation into the academic fraud allegations at UNC, focusing on gathering evidence such as emails, course records, and testimonies from involved parties. I would interview individuals like Julius Nyangâ€™oro, Deborah Crowder, academic counselors, and Mary Willingham to understand the extent of the fraud and the roles each person played. I would also review the NCAA report and the reforms implemented by UNC to address the issue. Based on the findings, I would recommend appropriate disciplinary actions for those involved in the academic fraud scheme and propose further measures to prevent such misconduct in the future.
