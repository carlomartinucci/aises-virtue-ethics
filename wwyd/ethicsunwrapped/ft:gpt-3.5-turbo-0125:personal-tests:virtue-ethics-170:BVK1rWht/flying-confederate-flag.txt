I would support the decision to remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina State House grounds as it was a symbol associated with a painful history of racism and oppression. I would acknowledge the emotional and historical significance of the flag to different groups of people, but ultimately prioritize the need to promote unity and inclusivity in public spaces. I would work towards facilitating open dialogues and educational initiatives to help people understand the complex history behind the flag and why its removal was necessary for healing and progress.
