I would immediately report the sign-stealing scheme conducted by the Houston Astros to the appropriate authorities within Major League Baseball (MLB). This would involve providing all relevant information and evidence that I have regarding the scheme, including details about the "Codebreaker" algorithm, the use of live game feeds, the banging scheme involving trash cans, and the involvement of key personnel such as players, managers, and executives. I would cooperate fully with the investigation and ensure that all necessary steps are taken to address the cheating scandal and uphold the integrity of the game.
