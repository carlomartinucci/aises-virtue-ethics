I would thoroughly investigate the allegations against Dennis Kozlowski, including reviewing financial records, conducting interviews with relevant parties, and consulting with legal experts to determine the legality and authorization of the bonuses and expenses in question. I would also assess the corporate governance structure at Tyco International during Kozlowski's tenure to understand the oversight mechanisms in place. Based on the findings, I would make a recommendation to the board of directors regarding any further actions to be taken, such as potential legal recourse or changes to corporate policies to prevent similar issues in the future.
