I would immediately report the fraudulent account creation practices to the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Securities and Exchange Commission, providing them with all the evidence and information available to ensure a thorough investigation. Additionally, I would encourage and support any employees who wish to blow the whistle on these unethical practices, ensuring that they are protected from retaliation and that their concerns are taken seriously. I would also work with senior management to implement a comprehensive review of the bank's sales practices and culture to prevent such misconduct from happening again in the future.
