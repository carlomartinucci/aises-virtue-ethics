I would conduct a thorough review of all my current and past lobbying activities to ensure full transparency and disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest. This review would include examining all financial transactions, client relationships, and communications to identify any instances where my actions may not have aligned with the best interests of my clients or the public. Additionally, I would implement strict internal controls and ethical guidelines to prevent any future ethical lapses or conflicts of interest in my lobbying work.
