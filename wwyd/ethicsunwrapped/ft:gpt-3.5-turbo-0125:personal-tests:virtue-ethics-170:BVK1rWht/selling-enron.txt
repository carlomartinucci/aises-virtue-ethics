I would immediately report the unethical and illegal business practices at Enron to the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). I would provide detailed information about the schemes Enron used to manipulate electricity markets in California, including submitting false demand schedules, creating imaginary transmission schedules, and selling services they did not have. I would also offer to cooperate fully with any investigations and provide any evidence or documentation I have to support the claims of misconduct. Additionally, I would encourage other employees who are aware of these practices to come forward and report them as well.
