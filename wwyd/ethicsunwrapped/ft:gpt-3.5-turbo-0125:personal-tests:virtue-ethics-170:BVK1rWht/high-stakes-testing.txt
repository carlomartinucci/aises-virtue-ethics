I would conduct a thorough review of the research on the effectiveness of high stakes testing in improving student outcomes, particularly focusing on any studies that specifically address the impact of standardized testing on minority communities. This review would include examining both quantitative data on test scores and qualitative data on the experiences of students, parents, and teachers. Additionally, I would seek out perspectives from educators and administrators who have successfully implemented alternative assessment methods that have led to positive outcomes for students. Based on this research, I would compile a comprehensive report outlining the potential benefits and drawbacks of high stakes testing, as well as alternative approaches to assessment that could address the concerns raised by opponents of standardized testing. Finally, I would present this report to relevant stakeholders, including parents, teachers, administrators, and policymakers, in order to facilitate an informed and productive dialogue on the future of assessment practices in public education.
