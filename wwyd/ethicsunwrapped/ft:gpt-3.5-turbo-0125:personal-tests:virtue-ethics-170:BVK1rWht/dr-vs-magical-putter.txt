I would acknowledge the mistakes made in the reporting of the article and the harm caused to Dr. Essay Anne Vanderbilt. I would issue a public apology on behalf of Grantland, expressing regret for the lack of sensitivity and awareness regarding trans issues. I would also take responsibility for the decision to out Vanderbilt as trans, recognizing the impact it had on her privacy and well-being. Additionally, I would commit to providing training and education for the staff on reporting ethically and responsibly on sensitive topics, including issues related to the transgender community.
