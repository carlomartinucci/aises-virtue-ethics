I would immediately report the incidents of significant overdoses of radiation to patients to the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the FDA, and provide all relevant information and documentation regarding the accidents. I would also recommend a thorough investigation into the design, software, and safety features of the Therac-25 machine to identify the root causes of the accidents and prevent future occurrences. Additionally, I would advocate for transparency and accountability within the company to ensure that all safety concerns are addressed promptly and effectively.
