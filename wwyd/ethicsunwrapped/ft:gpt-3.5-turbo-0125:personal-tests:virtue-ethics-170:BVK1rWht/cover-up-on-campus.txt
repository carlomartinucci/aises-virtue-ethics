I would report the situation to the appropriate authorities within the university, such as the Title IX coordinator or the university administration, providing all the evidence and information available regarding the sexual assault cases involving football players. I would ensure that the victims are supported and that the university takes immediate action to investigate the allegations thoroughly and hold those responsible accountable. Additionally, I would cooperate fully with any external investigations or audits conducted by independent parties to ensure transparency and accountability in addressing the systemic failures within the football program.
