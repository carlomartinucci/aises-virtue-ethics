I would collaborate with other paleontologists, researchers, and stakeholders to establish a transparent and ethical sourcing framework for acquiring amber fossils from Myanmar. This framework would include guidelines for verifying the origins of the fossils to ensure they were obtained through legal and ethical means, as well as mechanisms for monitoring and reporting any potential violations. By working together, we can promote responsible practices in the acquisition of these valuable specimens while minimizing the negative impact on local communities and the environment.
