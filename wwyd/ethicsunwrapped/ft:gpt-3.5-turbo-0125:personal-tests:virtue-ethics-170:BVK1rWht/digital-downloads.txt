I would analyze the specific terms and conditions of the agreement between Apple and the artists to understand the extent of the compensation being offered. I would then communicate with the artists affected by the initial terms to gather their feedback and concerns regarding the compensation structure. Based on this information, I would negotiate with Apple on behalf of the artists to ensure fair and reasonable compensation for their music during the initial three-month period on Apple Music.
