If I were in a position to implement changes in a company to improve employee treatment and success, I would focus on increasing wages and benefits for employees, investing in training programs to enhance their skills, and providing them with more autonomy to make decisions. I would also resist layoffs as much as possible and prioritize employee satisfaction alongside productivity. Additionally, I would work towards simplifying processes and reducing complexity in operations to improve efficiency and reduce costs.
