I would have taken immediate action upon discovering the initial loss in July 1992 by reporting it to my superiors at Barings Bank, providing full transparency about the situation, and seeking guidance on how to rectify the loss through proper channels. I would have refrained from attempting to cover up the loss or engage in speculative trading to recover the funds, as this would only exacerbate the situation and potentially lead to larger losses. By being honest and forthcoming about the loss from the beginning, I could have potentially prevented the catastrophic downfall of Barings Bank and the subsequent legal and financial repercussions that followed.
