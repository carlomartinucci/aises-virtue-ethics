I would recommend that Doubleday issue a public statement acknowledging the inaccuracies and fabrications in James Frey's book, A Million Little Pieces. The statement should apologize to readers who were misled by the false portrayal of events in the book and offer refunds to those who purchased it based on misrepresented information. Additionally, I would suggest that Doubleday work with Frey to reissue the book with a clear disclaimer about the fictionalized elements and market it as a work of fiction rather than a memoir. This would help to address the ethical concerns raised by the controversy and provide transparency to readers moving forward.
