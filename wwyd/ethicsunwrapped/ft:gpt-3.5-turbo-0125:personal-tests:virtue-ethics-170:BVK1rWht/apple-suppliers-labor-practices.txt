I would conduct a thorough investigation into Apple's supply chain, specifically focusing on the tin sourcing from Indonesia. I would gather detailed information on the specific mines and suppliers involved in providing tin for Apple's products. This would involve on-site visits to the mines, interviews with workers, and examination of working conditions and environmental impact.

Based on the findings of the investigation, I would work with Apple's supply chain team to develop and implement a comprehensive action plan to address any unethical practices in the tin sourcing process. This plan would include setting clear guidelines for responsible sourcing, establishing monitoring mechanisms to ensure compliance, and providing support for suppliers to improve working conditions and environmental sustainability.

Furthermore, I would collaborate with relevant stakeholders, such as local authorities, non-governmental organizations, and industry experts, to leverage their expertise and resources in driving positive change in the tin mining industry in Indonesia. This collaborative approach would help to create a more sustainable and ethical supply chain for Apple's products, aligning with the company's commitment to transparency and social responsibility.
