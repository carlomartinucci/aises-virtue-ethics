I would conduct a thorough environmental impact assessment of the proposed offshore drilling project in the Arctic. This assessment would involve studying the potential risks to the local ecosystem, including endangered species like polar bears and whales, as well as evaluating the capacity of oil companies to respond effectively to any potential oil spills in icy waters. Additionally, I would engage with local indigenous communities to understand their concerns and perspectives on the drilling project, as they are often disproportionately affected by such industrial activities. Based on the findings of the assessment, I would present a detailed report to decision-makers, highlighting the potential environmental risks and seeking alternative, more sustainable energy solutions that align with the protection of the Arctic ecosystem.
