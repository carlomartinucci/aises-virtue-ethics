I would refuse to participate in the illegal break-in at the office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist. I would voice my concerns about the legality and morality of the operation during the meeting where it was proposed and approved. I would emphasize the importance of upholding the law and ethical standards in our actions, even in the face of perceived national security crises. If necessary, I would seek guidance from legal experts or higher authorities to address the situation appropriately.
