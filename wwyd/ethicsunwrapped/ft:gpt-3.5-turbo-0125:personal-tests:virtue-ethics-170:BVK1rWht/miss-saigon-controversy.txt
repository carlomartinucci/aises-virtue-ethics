I would acknowledge the concerns raised by B.D. Wong and the Asian American community regarding the casting of Jonathan Pryce as the Eurasian character in Miss Saigon. I would work with the production team to engage in open dialogue with the community and listen to their perspectives on the issue. I would also explore the possibility of incorporating more diverse casting practices in future productions to ensure authentic representation on stage. Additionally, I would consider organizing forums or discussions to address the broader implications of casting decisions on diversity and inclusion in the performing arts industry.
