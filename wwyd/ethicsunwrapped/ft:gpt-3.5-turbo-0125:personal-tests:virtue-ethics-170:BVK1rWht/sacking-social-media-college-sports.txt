I would implement a social media policy for the college athletes that clearly outlines acceptable and unacceptable behavior on social media platforms. The policy would include guidelines on appropriate language, content, and behavior, as well as consequences for violating the policy. I would ensure that all athletes receive training on the policy and understand the importance of maintaining a positive and respectful online presence. Additionally, I would regularly monitor athletes' social media accounts to ensure compliance with the policy and address any issues promptly.
