I would refuse the principal's request to change students' answers on the standardized tests, explaining that while I understand the high stakes involved, I cannot compromise the integrity of the testing process. Instead, I would propose alternative strategies to support the students who are at risk of failing, such as providing additional tutoring, resources, or interventions to help them improve their performance legitimately. I would also document and report the principal's request to the appropriate authorities to ensure that the issue is addressed properly.
