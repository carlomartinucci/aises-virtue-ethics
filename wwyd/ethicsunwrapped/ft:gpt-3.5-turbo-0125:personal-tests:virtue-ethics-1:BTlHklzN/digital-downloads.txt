I would conduct a thorough analysis of the impact of Napster on the music industry, including the perspectives of artists, record companies, and consumers. This analysis would involve studying the actual financial losses incurred by artists due to music piracy on Napster, as well as the potential benefits in terms of increased exposure and fan base. I would also research the long-term effects of Napster's shutdown on the evolution of digital music distribution and the emergence of legal streaming services. This comprehensive analysis would provide a nuanced understanding of the complex issues surrounding artist compensation in the digital age, helping to inform future decisions and policies in the music industry.
