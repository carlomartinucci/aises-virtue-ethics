I would immediately intervene by speaking to the store manager and the police officers, informing them that the two men were waiting for a business meeting with a friend who was on his way. I would explain the situation, emphasizing that the men were not causing any disturbance and had a legitimate reason to be in the store. I would request the manager to allow the men to wait for their friend without any further interference and ask the police officers to stand down from making any arrests. If necessary, I would offer to facilitate communication between the parties involved to resolve the misunderstanding and prevent any escalation of the situation.
