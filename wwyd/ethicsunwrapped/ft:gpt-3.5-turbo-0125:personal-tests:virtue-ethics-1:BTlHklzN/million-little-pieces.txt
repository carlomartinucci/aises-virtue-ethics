I would publicly apologize for the inaccuracies and fabrications in the book, taking full responsibility for misleading readers and for not being transparent about the blending of fact and fiction in the narrative. I would express regret for any harm caused to individuals who resonated with the story as a true account of addiction and recovery. Additionally, I would offer to refund readers who felt deceived by the misrepresentation of the book as a memoir.
