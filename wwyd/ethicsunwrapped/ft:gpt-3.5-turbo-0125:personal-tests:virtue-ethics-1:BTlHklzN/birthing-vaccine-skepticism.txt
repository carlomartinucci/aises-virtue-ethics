I would immediately report Andrew Wakefield's unethical behavior and research misconduct to the appropriate authorities, such as the General Medical Council, providing all the evidence and documentation I have gathered regarding his conflicts of interest, manipulation of research data, failure to disclose funding sources, and exploitation of vulnerable subjects. I would also offer to testify and cooperate fully with any investigations or hearings to ensure that Wakefield is held accountable for his actions and that the public is made aware of the extent of his deception.
