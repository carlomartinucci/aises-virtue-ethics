I would conduct a thorough review of the proposed "Protecting Individuals with Down Syndrome Act" introduced by the pro-life organizations to understand its specific provisions, implications, and potential impact on individuals seeking abortions based on a diagnosis of Down Syndrome. This review would involve analyzing the language of the bill, consulting legal experts to clarify any ambiguities, and identifying any conflicts with existing laws or constitutional rights. Additionally, I would gather data and research on the prevalence of abortions based on Down Syndrome diagnoses, the experiences of individuals with Down Syndrome, and the perspectives of medical professionals to inform my assessment of the proposed legislation.
