I would work with local community leaders, non-profit organizations, and religious institutions to establish temporary shelters and provide basic necessities for the unaccompanied minors who have been transported to our area. I would coordinate efforts to ensure that these children are housed in safe and secure facilities, receive proper medical care, have access to legal assistance for their immigration cases, and are eventually reunited with family members or sponsors in the U.S. I would also organize community outreach programs to educate the public about the situation these children are facing and garner support for their humane treatment and integration into our community.
