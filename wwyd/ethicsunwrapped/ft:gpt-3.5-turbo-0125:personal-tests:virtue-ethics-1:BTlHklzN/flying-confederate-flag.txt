I would support the decision to remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina State House grounds by Governor Nikki Haley by publicly expressing my agreement with the action and the reasons behind it. I would use my platform to educate others on the historical context of the flag and its association with racism and hate, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging and addressing the hurtful impact it has on many individuals. Additionally, I would engage in conversations with those who may disagree with the removal, listening to their perspectives and attempting to foster understanding and empathy through respectful dialogue.
