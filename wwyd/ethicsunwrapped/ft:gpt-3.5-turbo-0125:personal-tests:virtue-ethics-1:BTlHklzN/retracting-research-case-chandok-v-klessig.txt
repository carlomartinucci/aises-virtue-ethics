I would ensure that all co-authors of the retracted article, including myself, issue a public statement acknowledging the retraction and taking responsibility for the oversight in replicating the results. This statement would emphasize the importance of scientific integrity and the need for rigorous verification of research findings before publication. Additionally, I would offer to collaborate with the scientific community to conduct further studies to address the discrepancies in the original research and work towards establishing the accuracy of the findings in a transparent manner.
