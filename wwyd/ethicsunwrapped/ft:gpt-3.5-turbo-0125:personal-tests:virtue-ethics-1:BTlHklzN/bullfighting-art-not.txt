I would conduct a thorough and impartial investigation into the actual welfare conditions of the fighting bulls both before and during the bullfighting events. This investigation would involve visiting the breeding farms where the bulls are raised, observing their living conditions, access to food and water, and any medical care they receive. Additionally, I would attend multiple bullfighting events incognito to witness firsthand how the bulls are treated in the arena, including the methods used by the bullfighters and the duration of the fights. After gathering all the necessary data, I would present a detailed report to the relevant authorities and stakeholders, highlighting any potential areas of improvement or concerns regarding the welfare of the bulls in bullfighting.
