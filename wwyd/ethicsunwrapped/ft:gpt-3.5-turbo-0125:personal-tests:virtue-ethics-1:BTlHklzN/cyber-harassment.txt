I would privately speak with the student who posted the hurtful messages, expressing my concern about the impact of her words on my well-being and reputation. I would listen to her reasons for the behavior and try to understand her perspective. I would then educate her on the consequences of cyberbullying and work with her to find a resolution, such as a sincere apology and a commitment to respectful online behavior in the future. I would also involve the school counselor to provide support to the student and prevent any further incidents of cyberbullying.
