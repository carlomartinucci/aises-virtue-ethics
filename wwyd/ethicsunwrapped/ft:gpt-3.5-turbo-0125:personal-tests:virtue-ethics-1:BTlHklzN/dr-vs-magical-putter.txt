I would have respected Dr. Essay Anne Vanderbilt's wish to maintain her privacy by not publishing the article after discovering her transgender identity and the fact that she did not want the story to be made public. I would have informed my editor about the situation, explained the ethical concerns, and worked with them to find an alternative angle for the story that would not involve outing Dr. Vanderbilt against her wishes. If necessary, I would have sought guidance from experts in the transgender community to better understand the potential impact of the article before making a final decision on whether to proceed with its publication.
