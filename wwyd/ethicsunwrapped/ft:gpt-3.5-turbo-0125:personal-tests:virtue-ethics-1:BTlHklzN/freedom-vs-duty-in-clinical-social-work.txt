I would immediately consult with a supervisor or a colleague who is experienced in handling ethical dilemmas in social work. I would provide them with all the details of the situation, including my religious beliefs, the client's disclosure, and my concerns about providing unbiased treatment. I would seek their guidance on how to proceed in the best interest of the client while also addressing my own internal conflict.
