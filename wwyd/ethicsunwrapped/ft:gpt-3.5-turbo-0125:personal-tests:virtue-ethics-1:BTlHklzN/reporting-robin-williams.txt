I would carefully review the specific details and graphic information provided in the coroner's report about Robin Williams' suicide that were shared by Lt. Keith Boyd during the press conference. After assessing the level of graphic detail and the potential harm it could cause in terms of providing a "how-to" guide for suicide, I would make the decision to exclude or minimize the specific details in my own reporting. This would involve editing out any unnecessary specifics about the methods used by Williams in order to prevent glorification or normalization of suicide in the eyes of the public. Additionally, I would consider the objections raised by mental health experts and members of the public regarding the potential negative impact of such detailed reporting on vulnerable individuals, and prioritize the ethical considerations of responsible journalism in my final report.
