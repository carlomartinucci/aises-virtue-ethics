I would conduct a thorough review of the research protocols and procedures followed by the research engineers at Heidelberg University in using the adult and child cadavers in simulated car crash tests. This review would specifically focus on ensuring that the families of the deceased individuals had provided informed consent for the use of the cadavers in the research. I would also assess the extent to which the research findings from the cadaver tests provided unique and critical insights that could not have been obtained through testing with crash dummies. Based on this review, I would determine whether the use of human cadavers was ethically justified in this particular research context.
