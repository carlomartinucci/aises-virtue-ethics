I would immediately report any information or evidence I have regarding the sexual assault cases involving football players to the Title IX coordinator, Patty Crawford, to ensure that the cases are properly investigated and the victims receive the necessary support and protection. This includes providing any emails, text messages, or conversations that indicate knowledge or involvement of football staff, including Art Briles and Ian McCaw, in covering up or mishandling the assault cases.
