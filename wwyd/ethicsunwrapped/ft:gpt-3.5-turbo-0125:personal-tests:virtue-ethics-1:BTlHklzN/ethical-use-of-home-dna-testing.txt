I would conduct thorough research on the specific privacy policies and data-sharing practices of the home DNA testing companies, such as 23andMe and Ancestry. This would involve carefully reading through their terms of service, privacy agreements, and any other relevant documentation available on their websites. I would pay close attention to how they handle and share customers' genetic information, as well as any partnerships they have with third-party organizations, including pharmaceutical companies and research institutions. Additionally, I would look into any past incidents or lawsuits related to privacy breaches or unauthorized sharing of genetic data by these companies.
