I would schedule a meeting with the assistant principal who observed the lesson and demanded that the video be stopped. During the meeting, I would calmly and respectfully discuss the educational objectives of the lesson on racial segregation laws during the Jim Crow era. I would provide additional context on the historical significance of blackface performances and explain how it was used to perpetuate harmful stereotypes of African Americans. I would also share the feedback from the students and parents who supported the lesson as a valuable learning experience. Finally, I would propose a constructive way to address any concerns raised by the assistant principal and work towards a resolution that ensures a more inclusive and effective approach to teaching sensitive historical topics in the future.
