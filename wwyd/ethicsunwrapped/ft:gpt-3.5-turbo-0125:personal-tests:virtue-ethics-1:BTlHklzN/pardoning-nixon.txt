I would conduct a thorough and transparent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the pardon of Richard Nixon. This investigation would involve gathering all relevant documents, interviewing key individuals involved in the decision-making process, and consulting with legal experts to ensure that the pardon was granted in accordance with the law. The findings of this investigation would be made public to address any concerns of a potential deal or improper influence in the pardon decision.
