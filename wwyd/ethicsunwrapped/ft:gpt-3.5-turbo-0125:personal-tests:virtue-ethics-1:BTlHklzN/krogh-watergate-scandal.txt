I would refuse to participate in the illegal break-in at the office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist. I would immediately raise my concerns about the legality and morality of the operation during the meeting where it was proposed and approved. I would clearly articulate that such actions are not justifiable in the name of national security and that I cannot be a part of any plan that involves breaking the law or violating ethical standards. If necessary, I would seek guidance from legal counsel within the administration or report the situation to the appropriate authorities to prevent the illegal operation from taking place.
