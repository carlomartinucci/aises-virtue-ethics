I would conduct a thorough review of Tyco's financial records, specifically focusing on the transactions related to Dennis Kozlowski's personal expenses, unauthorized bonuses, and other questionable purchases. This review would involve analyzing the documentation, receipts, and approvals for these transactions to determine their legitimacy and compliance with company policies and legal requirements. Additionally, I would interview relevant employees involved in processing these transactions to gather more information and insights into the decision-making process behind them.
