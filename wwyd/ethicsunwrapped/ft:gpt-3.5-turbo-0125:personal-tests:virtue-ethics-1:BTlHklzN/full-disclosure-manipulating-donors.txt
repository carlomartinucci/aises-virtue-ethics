I would approach Mary privately after the fundraising dinner and express my concerns about the misperception Robert had regarding the shelter's clientele. I would suggest that it is important to ensure donors have accurate information about the organization they are supporting. I would recommend that in future interactions with donors, we make it clear that Casa Tia Maria primarily serves Central American immigrants in need of assistance. Additionally, I would propose that we provide educational materials or presentations specifically outlining the demographics of the shelter's residents to avoid any misunderstandings in the future.
