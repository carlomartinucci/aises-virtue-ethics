I would actively participate in the mandatory online course on the classification process and requirements for Paralympic athletes. I would thoroughly engage with the material provided, ask questions for clarification if needed, and ensure that I have a solid understanding of the ethical guidelines and rules regarding classification. Additionally, I would take notes during the course to retain important information and be prepared to apply the knowledge gained in real-life situations during competitions.
