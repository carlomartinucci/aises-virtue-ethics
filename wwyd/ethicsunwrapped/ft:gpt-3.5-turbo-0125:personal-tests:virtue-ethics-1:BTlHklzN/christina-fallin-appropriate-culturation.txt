I would reach out to Summer Morgan, the member of the Kiowa tribe in Oklahoma, to arrange a meeting with Christina Fallin and Pink Pony. During the meeting, I would facilitate a respectful and open dialogue between the two parties to discuss the significance of the Plains headdress in Native American culture, the impact of cultural appropriation, and the importance of proper representation and respect for indigenous traditions. I would encourage Fallin and her band to listen actively to Morgan's perspective, ask questions to deepen their understanding, and work collaboratively to find alternative ways to express their admiration for Native American cultures that are culturally sensitive and appropriate. Additionally, I would offer resources and support to help educate Fallin and Pink Pony on the history and significance of Native American traditions to ensure that their future artistic expressions are respectful and well-informed.
