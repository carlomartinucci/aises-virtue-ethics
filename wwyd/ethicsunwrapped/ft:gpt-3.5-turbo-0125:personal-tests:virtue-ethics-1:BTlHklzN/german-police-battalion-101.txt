I would have a private conversation with each member of the reserve police battalion, emphasizing the gravity of the situation and the moral implications of their actions. I would remind them of the choice given by their commander to opt out of the killings and assure them that there would be no repercussions for choosing not to participate. I would encourage them to reflect on their personal values and conscience, urging them to consider the long-term consequences of their actions on themselves and the victims.
