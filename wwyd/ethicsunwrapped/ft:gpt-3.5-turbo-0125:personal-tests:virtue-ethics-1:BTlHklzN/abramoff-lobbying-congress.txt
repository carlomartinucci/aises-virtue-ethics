I would immediately disclose to the Tigua Tribal Nation the failed outcome of my lobbying efforts to grant them gaming rights through the election-reform bill provision. I would provide them with a detailed account of the situation, including the unsuccessful results of the golfing trip to Scotland with Representative Bob Ney and the subsequent lack of progress in securing their gaming rights. Additionally, I would offer to refund the Tigua the money they paid for my services related to this specific endeavor, acknowledging the lack of success and the misleading communication that took place.
