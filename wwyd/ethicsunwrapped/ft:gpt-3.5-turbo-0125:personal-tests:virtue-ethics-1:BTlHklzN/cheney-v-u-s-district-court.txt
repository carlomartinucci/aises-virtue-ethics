I would carefully review the federal law that states "any justice or judge shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might be questioned" to determine if Justice Scalia's actions, specifically the duck hunting trip with defendant Cheney, could reasonably call his impartiality into question. If I find that there is a valid argument for questioning Justice Scalia's impartiality based on the social interaction with Cheney during the pending case, I would recommend raising this concern to the appropriate judicial oversight body for further investigation and potential action.
