I would first review the university's policies regarding media access to public spaces on campus to understand the guidelines in place. Then, I would reach out to the protesters to have a respectful conversation about the importance of freedom of the press and the role of journalists in documenting events. I would offer to facilitate a meeting between the protesters and the university administration to find a solution that respects both the protesters' concerns and the journalists' rights. If needed, I would seek guidance from the university's communications department on how to navigate the situation effectively.
