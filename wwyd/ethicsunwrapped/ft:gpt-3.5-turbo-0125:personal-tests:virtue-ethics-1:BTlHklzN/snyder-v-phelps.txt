I would support Albert Snyder in exploring alternative ways to seek justice and closure, such as organizing a peaceful counter-protest during future Westboro Baptist Church demonstrations to spread messages of love and unity in honor of fallen soldiers like his son. This would involve collaborating with local community groups, veterans' organizations, and religious institutions to plan a respectful and positive event that celebrates the lives and sacrifices of military personnel. Additionally, I would assist Snyder in raising awareness about the harmful impact of hate speech and the importance of upholding the dignity of all individuals, especially in times of grief and mourning.
