I would schedule a meeting with the hospital's ethics committee to discuss the conflicting information regarding the efficacy of flu shots, the AMA's recommendation, and my moral obligation to provide informed advice to my senior patients. During the meeting, I would present the research findings on flu shot effectiveness, the potential benefits of the blood assay for predicting adverse events, and the AMA Code of Ethics emphasizing patient autonomy. I would seek guidance on how to navigate the situation without compromising patient trust, while also addressing the hospital's policy on flu shots for staff.
