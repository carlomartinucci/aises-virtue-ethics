I would immediately report all the information I have about Rick Singer's fraudulent schemes, including the specific tactics he used such as bribing coaches, manipulating test scores, and fabricating athletic profiles, to the FBI or relevant law enforcement authorities. I would provide any evidence I have, such as emails, documents, or recordings, to assist in their investigation and prosecution of Singer and the parents involved in the college admissions scandal.
