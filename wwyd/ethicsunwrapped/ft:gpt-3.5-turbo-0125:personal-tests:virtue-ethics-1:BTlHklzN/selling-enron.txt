I would gather concrete evidence of the fraudulent schemes being carried out by Enron in the California electricity markets, including falsified demand schedules, imaginary transmission schedules, and selling services Enron did not possess. This evidence would include internal communications, transaction records, and any other documentation that directly proves the illegal activities. Once I have compiled a comprehensive dossier of evidence, I would present it to the appropriate regulatory authorities in California, such as the California Public Utilities Commission or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to initiate a formal investigation into Enron's misconduct in the electricity markets.
