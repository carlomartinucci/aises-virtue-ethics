I would ensure that before appropriating any image or object for my artwork, I conduct thorough research to determine the original source and any copyright ownership associated with it. This would involve reaching out to the relevant parties, such as the photographer or the organization holding the rights, to seek permission for the specific usage I intend for the appropriation. If permission is granted, I would clearly outline the terms of use, including giving proper credit and potentially negotiating any compensation if required. By proactively engaging with the copyright holders, I aim to establish a transparent and mutually beneficial agreement that respects the rights of the original creators while allowing me to create my artwork in a legally sound and ethical manner.
