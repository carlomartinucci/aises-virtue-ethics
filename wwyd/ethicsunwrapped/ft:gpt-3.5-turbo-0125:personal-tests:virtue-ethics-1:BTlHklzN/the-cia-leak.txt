I would publicly support Valerie Plame's concerns about the pardon of Scooter Libby by President Trump. I would write an op-ed or make a public statement emphasizing the importance of upholding the integrity of the justice system and the need to protect the identities of covert operatives for the safety of national security. Additionally, I would call for a review of the pardon process to ensure that such decisions are made with careful consideration and consultation with relevant agencies like the CIA.
