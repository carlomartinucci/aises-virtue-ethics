I would conduct a study to further investigate the phenomenon of moral licensing in consumer behavior, specifically focusing on the relationship between purchasing green products and subsequent unethical behaviors. The study would involve recruiting a diverse group of participants and exposing them to different shopping scenarios where they are given the opportunity to choose between green and conventional products. After the shopping task, I would design various ethical decision-making tasks to assess their likelihood of engaging in unethical behaviors, such as cheating or stealing. By collecting and analyzing the data, I aim to provide more insights into the underlying mechanisms of moral licensing and its implications for consumer behavior.
