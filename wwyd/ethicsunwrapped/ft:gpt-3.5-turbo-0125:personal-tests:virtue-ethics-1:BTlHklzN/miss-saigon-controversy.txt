I would acknowledge the concerns raised by B.D. Wong and the Asian American community regarding the casting of Jonathan Pryce as the Eurasian character in Miss Saigon. I would initiate a dialogue with the community leaders and advocacy groups to understand their perspectives and the impact of such casting decisions on representation in the performing arts. I would work towards finding a solution that addresses the lack of opportunities for Asian American actors while also considering the artistic integrity of the production. This could involve exploring alternative casting options, such as actively seeking out talented Asian actors for the role and ensuring that their voices are heard in the decision-making process.
