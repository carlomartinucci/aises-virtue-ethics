I would immediately report the issues with the Therac-25 machine to the highest levels of management within AECL and CGR, providing detailed documentation of the software design flaws, inadequate testing, and the reuse of patches from earlier versions. I would emphasize the urgent need for a comprehensive review and overhaul of the software to ensure patient safety. Additionally, I would request a meeting with the engineering and software development teams to discuss the specific steps needed to address the identified problems and prevent any further accidents.
