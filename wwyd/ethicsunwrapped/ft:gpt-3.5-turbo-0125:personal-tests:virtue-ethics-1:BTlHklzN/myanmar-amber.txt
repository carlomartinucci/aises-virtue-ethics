I would collaborate with other paleontologists, researchers, and relevant stakeholders to establish a certification system for ethically sourced Myanmar amber fossils. This system would involve on-the-ground verification processes to ensure that the fossils were obtained without contributing to conflict, human rights abuses, or exploitative labor practices. By creating a transparent and accountable supply chain, we can provide assurance to the scientific community and collectors that the fossils they acquire have been sourced in a responsible manner.
