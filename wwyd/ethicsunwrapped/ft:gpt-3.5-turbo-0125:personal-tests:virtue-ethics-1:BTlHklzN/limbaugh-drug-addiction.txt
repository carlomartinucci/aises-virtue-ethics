I would publicly address the situation on my talk show, taking full responsibility for my actions and acknowledging the harm caused by my illegal drug use. I would apologize to my audience, fans, and the public for my hypocrisy in advocating for strict legal consequences for drug users while engaging in illegal drug activities myself. I would openly discuss my addiction to painkillers, the impact it has had on my life, and the steps I am taking to seek treatment and recovery. Additionally, I would use my platform to raise awareness about the realities of addiction and the importance of seeking help.
