I would conduct a thorough review of Apple's supply chain to identify specific tin mines in Indonesia that are known to have unsafe and unethical working conditions. This would involve analyzing supplier information, conducting on-site visits if possible, and collaborating with independent auditors to verify the conditions at these mines. Once the problematic mines are identified, I would work with Apple's procurement team to establish a plan to gradually transition away from sourcing tin from these mines while supporting and incentivizing the adoption of responsible mining practices. This could include providing training and resources to help miners improve safety standards and working conditions, as well as exploring alternative, ethically sourced tin suppliers. Throughout this process, I would ensure open communication with stakeholders, including affected communities, advocacy groups, and government agencies, to address concerns and gather feedback on the effectiveness of the initiatives implemented.
