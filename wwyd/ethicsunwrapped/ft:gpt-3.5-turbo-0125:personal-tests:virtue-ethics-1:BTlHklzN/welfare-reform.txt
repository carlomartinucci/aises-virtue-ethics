I would conduct a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the PRWORA bill on low-income families and individuals by gathering data on key indicators such as employment rates, poverty levels, access to education and healthcare, and overall well-being. This analysis would involve collaborating with researchers, social workers, and community organizations to ensure a holistic understanding of the effects of the legislation on different demographic groups. Additionally, I would actively seek feedback from individuals directly affected by the welfare reform to incorporate their perspectives into the assessment. The goal of this analysis would be to identify specific areas where the current system is failing to adequately support those in need and to propose evidence-based policy recommendations for addressing these shortcomings.
