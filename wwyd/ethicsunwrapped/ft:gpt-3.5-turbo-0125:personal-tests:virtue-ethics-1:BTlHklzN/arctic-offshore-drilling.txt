I would conduct a thorough environmental impact assessment specifically focused on the potential risks and consequences of offshore drilling in the Arctic. This assessment would involve gathering data on the local ecosystem, wildlife populations, ice conditions, and the potential effects of an oil spill on the environment. I would also consult with environmental experts, indigenous communities, and other stakeholders to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the potential impacts. Based on the findings of the assessment, I would present a detailed report to President Obama outlining the specific environmental risks and recommending alternative, more sustainable energy sources and practices to consider instead of expanding offshore drilling in the Arctic.
