I would immediately take responsibility for my actions and issue a public statement acknowledging the full extent of my behavior that night in Rio. I would express sincere remorse for the false claims made, the negative impact on the Brazilian authorities, and the tarnishing of the reputation of American athletes. I would specifically address the privilege and entitlement that my actions displayed and commit to actively working towards making amends with the Brazilian community. Additionally, I would offer to participate in further community service in Brazil as a way to demonstrate my genuine desire to rectify the situation and contribute positively to the country that hosted the Olympic Games.
