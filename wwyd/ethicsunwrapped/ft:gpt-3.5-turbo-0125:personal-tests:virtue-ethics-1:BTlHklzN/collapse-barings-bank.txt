I would immediately inform my superiors at Barings Bank in London about the massive losses that have been incurred due to my speculative trading activities in Singapore. I would provide them with a detailed account of the situation, including the initial loss that was hidden and the subsequent unsuccessful attempts to recover the losses through further trading. I would be transparent about the extent of the losses and the risks posed to the bank's financial stability. Additionally, I would cooperate fully with internal and external auditors to ensure a thorough investigation into the matter.
