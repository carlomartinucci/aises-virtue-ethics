I would implement a social media policy workshop for all college athletes at the University of South Carolina. This workshop would include interactive sessions on the potential consequences of inappropriate social media use, case studies of past incidents involving athletes, and practical tips on how to maintain a positive and professional online presence. Additionally, I would invite guest speakers, such as public relations professionals or sports media experts, to provide insights and guidance on navigating social media responsibly as a student-athlete. The workshop would be mandatory for all athletes and would be scheduled at the beginning of each academic year to reinforce the importance of thoughtful social media engagement throughout the season.
