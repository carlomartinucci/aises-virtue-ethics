I would immediately report the information provided by graduate assistant coach Mike McQueary to the police. I would not only inform the authorities about the incident of Sandusky fondling a young boy in the football locker room's shower facilities but also provide all the details I have regarding the situation. This action would ensure that the appropriate law enforcement agencies are involved in investigating the matter thoroughly and taking necessary steps to protect any potential victims.
