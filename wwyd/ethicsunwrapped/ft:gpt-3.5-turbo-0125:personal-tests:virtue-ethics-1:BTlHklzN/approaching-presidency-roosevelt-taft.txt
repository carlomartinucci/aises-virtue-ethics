I would carefully review the specific language and provisions of the Constitution and existing laws to determine if there are any explicit prohibitions or limitations on the president's authority to take actions such as creating national parks without state consent or supporting a revolt in another country to secure the Panama Canal. I would consult with legal experts, scholars, and advisors to gain a comprehensive understanding of the legal boundaries and implications of such actions. Based on this thorough analysis, I would make a decision on whether to proceed with these controversial actions, taking into account the potential legal, political, and ethical consequences of each choice.
