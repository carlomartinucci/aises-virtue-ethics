I would review the performance reviews, evaluations, meeting summaries, and messages presented as evidence by Kleiner Perkins during the trial to understand the specific criticisms and feedback provided to Ellen Pao. This would help me assess the validity of the negative performance reviews she received and determine if there were consistent patterns of criticism that could shed light on the reasons behind the decisions not to promote her or terminate her employment.
