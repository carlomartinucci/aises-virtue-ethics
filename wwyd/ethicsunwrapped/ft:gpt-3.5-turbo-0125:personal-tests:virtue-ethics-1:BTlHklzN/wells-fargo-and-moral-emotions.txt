I would immediately gather all the evidence I have regarding the fraudulent account creation, including any internal communications, customer complaints, and employee testimonies. I would then schedule a meeting with the senior management team to present this evidence and express my deep concerns about the unethical practices happening within the organization. I would push for a thorough internal investigation to identify all individuals involved in the fraud and ensure that appropriate disciplinary actions are taken, including termination if necessary. Additionally, I would work with HR to establish a support system for employees who have been negatively impacted by the toxic culture, providing resources for counseling and stress management.
