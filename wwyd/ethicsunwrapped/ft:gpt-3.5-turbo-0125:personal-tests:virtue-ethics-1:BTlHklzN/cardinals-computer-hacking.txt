I would immediately report my unauthorized access and theft of information from the Astros' webmail system to the appropriate authorities within the St. Louis Cardinals organization, providing a detailed account of the actions I took, the information I obtained, and the extent of my involvement in the hacking. I would fully cooperate with any internal investigation conducted by the Cardinals and provide all necessary information to assist in determining the impact of my actions and the appropriate steps to rectify the situation.
