I would immediately report the Astros' sign-stealing scheme to the MLB Commissioner's Office, providing all the evidence and information I have about the "Codebreaker" system, the use of electronic means to decode signs, the banging scheme involving trash cans, and the involvement of key personnel such as players, manager AJ Hinch, General Manager Rob Luhnhow, Carlos Beltran, and bench coach Alex Cora. I would be prepared to testify and cooperate fully with the MLB investigation to ensure that the full extent of the cheating is uncovered and appropriate disciplinary actions are taken against those involved.
