I would immediately report the Astros' sign-stealing scheme to the MLB Commissioner's office, providing all the evidence and information I have gathered about the "Codebreaker" system, the live feed monitoring, and the trash can banging method used by the Astros players to cheat during games. I would be prepared to testify and cooperate fully with the league's investigation to ensure that all those involved in the cheating scandal are held accountable, including players, coaches, and front office staff.
