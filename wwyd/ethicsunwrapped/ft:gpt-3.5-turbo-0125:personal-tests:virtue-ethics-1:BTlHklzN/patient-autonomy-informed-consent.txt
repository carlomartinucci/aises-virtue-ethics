I would convene a meeting with the hospital staff involved in the patient's care, including the medical team, the patient's son who is the legal guardian, and any relevant mental health professionals. During this meeting, I would openly discuss the ethical concerns surrounding the proposed method of administering the new drug to the patient. I would facilitate a thorough conversation to explore alternative options that could respect the patient's autonomy and dignity while also considering the best interests of the patient's health and well-being. If necessary, I would seek guidance from the hospital's ethics committee to ensure a comprehensive and ethically sound decision-making process.
