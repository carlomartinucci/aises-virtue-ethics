I would ensure that Franz Stangl is held accountable for his actions by fully cooperating with the legal authorities, providing all the necessary evidence and testimony to ensure a fair trial and conviction. This would include sharing any information I have about Stangl's role in the Holocaust, his specific actions at the killing centers, and any other relevant details that could contribute to the prosecution's case against him. I would also support the efforts to uncover the truth about Stangl's involvement in the genocide, including encouraging other witnesses to come forward and testify.
