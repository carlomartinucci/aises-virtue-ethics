I would gather all the relevant evidence and documentation regarding the academic fraud scheme involving the AFAM department at UNC, including emails, course materials, and any other records that demonstrate the lack of academic rigor in the courses offered. I would then schedule a meeting with the university administration, including the Provost and relevant department heads, to present the evidence and discuss the necessary steps to address the situation. During the meeting, I would emphasize the need for a thorough investigation into the extent of the academic fraud, the individuals involved, and the systemic issues that allowed it to persist for 18 years. I would also propose implementing new policies and procedures to prevent similar misconduct in the future, such as regular audits of coursework, stricter oversight of independent study courses, and mandatory training for faculty and staff on academic integrity.
