I would publicly advocate for the exoneration of the Central Park 5 by using social media platforms to share the indisputable evidence of their innocence, such as the DNA match to Matias Reyes and the lack of physical evidence linking the young men to the crime. I would engage with influential figures, such as journalists, activists, and legal experts, to raise awareness about the miscarriage of justice in this case. Additionally, I would reach out to organizations dedicated to criminal justice reform to seek their support in pressuring the authorities to officially exonerate the Central Park 5 and publicly acknowledge their wrongful conviction.
