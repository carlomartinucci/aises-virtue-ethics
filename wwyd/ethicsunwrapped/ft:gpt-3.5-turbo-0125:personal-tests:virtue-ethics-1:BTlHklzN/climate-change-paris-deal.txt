I would work to raise awareness about the urgency of the climate crisis and the inadequacy of the voluntary targets set in the Paris climate agreement. This would involve organizing educational events, workshops, and campaigns to inform the public, policymakers, and businesses about the scientific consensus on the need for more ambitious action to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius. Additionally, I would collaborate with climate scientists, environmental organizations, and community leaders to develop specific policy recommendations that align with the latest climate research and advocate for their adoption by local, national, and international decision-makers.
