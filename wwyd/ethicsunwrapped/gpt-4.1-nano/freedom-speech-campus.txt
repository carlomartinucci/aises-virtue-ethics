1. Approach the protesters and students involved in the Missouri and Yale protests by engaging in a respectful, one-on-one conversation with a representative or leader of each group. During these conversations, listen carefully to their concerns about safety, respect, and inclusion, and acknowledge their feelings without judgment.

2. Contact the university administration at Yale and Missouri to request detailed reports on the incidents, including timelines, actions taken, and policies regarding free speech and campus safety. Request a meeting with key administrators to discuss how the institutions plan to address ongoing racial tensions and protect both free speech and student safety.

3. Offer to facilitate a moderated dialogue session between student protesters, university officials, and faculty members, focusing on understanding different perspectives and finding common ground on issues of safety, respect, and free expression.

4. Coordinate with campus security and student affairs to ensure that future protests and demonstrations are monitored to prevent violence or vandalism, while respecting students’ rights to assemble and express their views. Specifically, arrange for security personnel to be present at protests to de-escalate conflicts and protect journalists like Tim Tai from harassment or obstruction.

5. Reach out to student organizations representing marginalized groups to understand their specific safety concerns and work with them to develop a campus safety plan that includes designated safe zones, clear communication channels, and protocols for reporting incidents of harassment or violence.

6. Draft and distribute a campus-wide communication that emphasizes the importance of respecting free speech rights for all parties, including protesters, journalists, and university staff, and clarifies the university’s commitment to safety and inclusion. Ensure this message is delivered through multiple channels, such as email, campus posters, and social media.

7. Identify and connect with local community leaders, civil rights organizations, and legal advisors to provide additional support and resources for students and staff involved in or affected by the protests, ensuring their rights are protected and their concerns are addressed.

8. Document all interactions, meetings, and actions taken to address the protests and incidents, creating a record that can be used for ongoing review and future policy development.

9. Follow up regularly with student groups, faculty, and administration to assess the effectiveness of implemented measures and adjust strategies as needed to promote a safe, respectful, and open campus environment.
