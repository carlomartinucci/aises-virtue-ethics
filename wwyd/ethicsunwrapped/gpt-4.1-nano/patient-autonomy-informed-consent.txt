1. Consult the hospital’s ethics committee immediately to discuss the proposed surreptitious administration of the medication and seek their guidance on the ethical and legal appropriateness of this action.

2. Review the patient’s medical and legal records to confirm the details of his guardianship, the scope of the son’s authority under the guardianship and power of attorney, and any prior directives or assessments regarding his treatment preferences.

3. Arrange a meeting with the hospital’s legal counsel to clarify the legal boundaries of administering medication without the patient’s knowledge, even with guardian consent, and to understand potential liability issues.

4. Contact the patient’s treating psychiatrist and mental health team to discuss the clinical necessity of the medication, the risks and benefits of the proposed method, and alternative strategies that do not involve deception.

5. Explore alternative medication administration methods that do not require deception, such as using a different formulation (e.g., a liquid or dissolvable tablet) that the patient might accept without suspicion, or administering the medication in a manner consistent with the patient’s known preferences or previous consent.

6. If no acceptable alternative exists and the guardianship and legal review support the decision, document thoroughly the clinical rationale, the guardian’s consent, the ethical considerations, and the steps taken to minimize deception and uphold the patient’s dignity.

7. Before proceeding, hold a multidisciplinary team meeting to ensure all staff involved understand the plan, the ethical considerations, and the importance of transparency with the patient to the extent possible.

8. If the decision is made to proceed with the surreptitious administration, do so discreetly, ensuring the patient’s safety and dignity, and plan for ongoing assessment of his response and potential distress.

9. After administration, document the process meticulously, including the guardian’s consent, the method used, and the patient’s response, and prepare to revisit the decision regularly in light of the patient’s evolving condition and any new information.

10. Throughout, prioritize transparency with the guardian and, when feasible, with the patient, and plan for eventual disclosure and discussion about the treatment once the patient’s condition allows.
