1. Contact the Royal Free Hospital’s ethics committee immediately to report the unapproved endoscopies performed on the children without proper consent or oversight. Request a formal investigation into the procedures and ensure that all medical records and documentation are preserved for review.

2. Gather all medical records, consent forms, and documentation related to the twelve children involved in Wakefield’s study to verify whether proper ethical protocols and approvals were followed.

3. Notify the General Medical Council (GMC) about the findings of misconduct, including performing unnecessary high-risk procedures without ethics approval, conflicts of interest, and falsification of data, to initiate disciplinary proceedings against Wakefield.

4. Reach out to the Lancet’s editorial board to provide them with the evidence of data falsification and conflicts of interest, requesting a retraction of the 1998 article.

5. Contact the British Medical Association (BMA) to report Wakefield’s misconduct and seek guidance on further professional accountability measures.

6. Collaborate with legal authorities to review Wakefield’s financial arrangements, patent filings, and potential violations of medical ethics and laws related to research misconduct and conflicts of interest.

7. Prepare a detailed report summarizing the misconduct, including the undisclosed conflicts of interest, falsified data, unethical procedures, and the impact on public health, to inform regulatory and oversight bodies.

8. If possible, assist in disseminating corrected information to the public and healthcare providers to counteract misinformation stemming from Wakefield’s discredited research.

9. Document all actions taken and maintain a chain of evidence to support any future legal or disciplinary proceedings against Wakefield.

10. Consider consulting with bioethics experts to develop guidelines for preventing similar misconduct in future research projects.
