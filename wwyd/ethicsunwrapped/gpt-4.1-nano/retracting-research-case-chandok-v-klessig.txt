I would contact the BTI's institutional review board (IRB) or research integrity office to request a formal review of the case, specifically focusing on the replication attempts and the retraction process. I would submit a detailed written account of the original experiments, including all raw data, lab notes, and protocols used by Chandok, to ensure transparency. I would also request access to the investigation reports and any correspondence related to the retraction. If possible, I would seek to interview or obtain statements from the researchers involved in the replication attempts and the retraction decision. Additionally, I would document my own understanding of the timeline and actions taken, and consider consulting with a legal or ethics advisor to understand the implications of the case and my role in addressing any ongoing concerns about research integrity.
