1. Review all documents related to the bankruptcy filing, including the disclosure forms Gellene submitted, to identify any potential conflicts of interest or connections between Milbank Tweed, South Street, Salovaara, and other involved parties.

2. Contact the bankruptcy court clerk to request a copy of the original disclosure statements filed by Gellene and Milbank Tweed to verify what was disclosed at the time of filing.

3. Consult with the firm's ethics committee or legal compliance officer to review the case details and determine whether the nondisclosure was inadvertent or a potential ethical breach.

4. Prepare a detailed report summarizing the connections between Milbank Tweed, South Street, Salovaara, and any other relevant parties, highlighting what was disclosed and what was omitted.

5. If possible, reach out to the bankruptcy judge or court officials to clarify whether the nondisclosure affected the proceedings or if any corrective actions are required.

6. If it is determined that the nondisclosure was inadvertent and did not materially affect the case, document this finding thoroughly.

7. If the nondisclosure appears to be a significant oversight or potential conflict, advise the firm to voluntarily disclose the connections to the court and involved parties, and to cooperate with any ongoing investigations or proceedings.

8. Review internal policies and procedures to prevent similar nondisclosures in future cases, including implementing checklists for conflict disclosures and mandatory review steps before filing.

9. If Gellene is available and willing, discuss the case with him directly to understand his perspective and reasoning at the time of the nondisclosure, and advise him on potential corrective steps if appropriate.

10. Document all actions taken, findings, and communications for future reference and to ensure transparency and accountability.
