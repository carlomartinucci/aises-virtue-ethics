I would choose not to purchase or acquire any amber fossils from Myanmar's Kachin State. Specifically, I would:

1. Verify the provenance of any amber fossils I consider acquiring, ensuring they are sourced from reputable suppliers who can provide documentation confirming ethical extraction practices and compliance with international laws.

2. Avoid engaging with vendors or auction houses that cannot provide transparent sourcing information or that are known to deal with unverified or conflict-linked amber.

3. Support and promote organizations and initiatives that develop and enforce ethical sourcing standards for amber and fossils, such as collaborating with museums or scientific institutions that have strict provenance verification processes.

4. Publicly communicate my stance against purchasing amber fossils from Myanmar that lack verified ethical sourcing, to discourage demand that may perpetuate conflict and exploitation.

5. If I am involved in scientific research, I would prioritize studying fossils that are obtained through ethically responsible channels, or focus on fossils from regions with established, conflict-free sourcing.

6. Advocate for and participate in efforts to establish international guidelines and certification systems for ethically sourced amber fossils, to help ensure future acquisitions do not contribute to ongoing violence or human rights abuses.
