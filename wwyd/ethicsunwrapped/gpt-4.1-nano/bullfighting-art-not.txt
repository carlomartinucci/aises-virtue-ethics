I would organize a public demonstration or protest outside the bullfighting arena on the day of an event, holding signs and distributing leaflets that highlight the animal cruelty involved and advocate for banning or reforming bullfighting. I would coordinate with local animal rights groups to ensure a peaceful and well-informed presence. Additionally, I would record and share footage of the event and the protest on social media to raise awareness and garner public support.
