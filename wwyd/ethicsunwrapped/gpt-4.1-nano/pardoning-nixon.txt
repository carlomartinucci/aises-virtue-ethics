I would immediately contact Nixon’s attending physician or hospital staff to request detailed medical records and updates on Nixon’s health status, specifically focusing on his viral pneumonia and any signs of recurrence of phlebitis. I would then review these records to assess Nixon’s current health condition and prognosis. Based on this information, I would consult with medical experts to determine whether Nixon’s health truly posed an imminent risk of death or if his recovery was likely. If the medical evidence indicated that Nixon’s health was stable and not life-threatening, I would advise President Ford to reconsider the pardon decision, emphasizing the importance of accountability and justice. If Nixon’s health was indeed critical and life-threatening, I would support Ford’s decision to issue the pardon, citing medical advice and the need to prioritize national stability and compassion. Throughout, I would document all medical consultations and decisions made to ensure transparency and accountability.
