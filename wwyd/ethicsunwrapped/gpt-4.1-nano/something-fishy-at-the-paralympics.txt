1. Review and update the classification protocols by implementing more rigorous, multi-step assessments that include medical examinations, physical tests, and psychological evaluations conducted by independent, certified medical professionals to verify athletes’ disabilities accurately.

2. Establish unannounced, random re-classification checks during the Games, where officials can re-assess athletes’ disabilities and classifications without prior notice, to deter athletes from attempting to cheat during scheduled assessments.

3. Install surveillance measures such as video monitoring in classification areas and during physical assessments to detect suspicious behaviors like taping, submerging in cold water, or wearing braces not normally used.

4. Require athletes to submit detailed medical documentation and history verified by independent medical experts before classification, and cross-reference this information with their current physical assessments.

5. Implement a secure, centralized database that tracks athletes’ classification data, medical records, and assessment history, accessible only to authorized officials, to identify inconsistencies or suspicious patterns over time.

6. Conduct educational workshops and mandatory training sessions for athletes, coaches, and officials emphasizing the importance of fair play, the consequences of cheating, and the integrity of the classification system, similar to the Australian online course.

7. Enforce strict penalties for violations, including disqualification from the Games, suspension from future competitions, and legal action if applicable, and publicly disclose cases of proven cheating to serve as a deterrent.

8. Collaborate with international medical and sports organizations to develop standardized, transparent, and scientifically validated classification procedures, ensuring consistency across countries and sports.

9. Create a confidential reporting system that allows athletes, coaches, or officials to anonymously report suspected cheating or irregularities in classification processes.

10. Allocate resources to research and develop new, more precise methods of assessing impairments, such as advanced imaging or biometric testing, to stay ahead of potential cheating tactics.

By implementing these specific actions, I would aim to strengthen the integrity of the classification system and reduce the incidence of cheating in the Paralympics.
