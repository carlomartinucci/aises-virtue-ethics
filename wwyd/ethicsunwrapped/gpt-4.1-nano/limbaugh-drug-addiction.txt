Contact the appropriate legal authorities to report the illegal activity of doctor shopping and obtaining prescription drugs unlawfully. Specifically, I would:

1. Gather evidence: Collect any publicly available information or records related to Limbaugh’s prescription drug purchases, such as news reports or official statements, to verify the details of the illegal activity.
2. Contact law enforcement: Reach out to the Florida State Attorney’s Office or the local police department responsible for drug enforcement to report the suspected illegal prescription drug procurement.
3. Provide information: Share the evidence and details of the investigation, including Limbaugh’s admission of doctor shopping and the timeline of events, to assist authorities in their investigation.
4. Respect privacy and legal procedures: Ensure that any communication is factual and based on verified information, avoiding speculation or unsubstantiated claims.
5. Follow up: Maintain contact with authorities to offer additional information if needed and to stay informed about the progress of the investigation.
6. Consider ethical implications: If I am in a position of influence or have a platform, I might also consider publicly advocating for proper legal action or supporting addiction treatment programs, but only after ensuring that the legal process is underway and based on verified facts.
