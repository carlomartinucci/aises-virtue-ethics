I would contact the FBI directly to request detailed technical information about the methods they used to access the iPhone’s data after they withdrew the case. Specifically, I would:

1. Reach out to the FBI's cyber division or the lead investigator involved in the San Bernardino case.
2. Request a briefing or written report explaining the technical approach they employed to bypass the iPhone’s encryption.
3. Ask for assurances that the method used does not compromise the security of other devices or users, and inquire about any safeguards or limitations associated with the technique.
4. Document the information received and consult with internal security and legal teams to assess the implications for future privacy and security policies.
5. Based on the technical details, evaluate whether to develop or implement similar security measures internally or to advocate for industry-wide standards to prevent similar vulnerabilities from being exploited maliciously.
