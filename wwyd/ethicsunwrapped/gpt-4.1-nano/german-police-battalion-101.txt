In this scenario, if I were a member of the police battalion during that time and faced with the choice to participate in mass murder or refuse, I would:

1. **Identify the opportunity to refuse**: Recognize that the commander explicitly offered the option to be reassigned if not willing to participate in killing.

2. **Express my refusal clearly**: Verbally communicate to the commanding officer that I do not wish to participate in the killing operations, citing moral or personal reasons if necessary.

3. **Stand firm in my decision**: Maintain my refusal despite peer pressure or the potential for social or professional repercussions, making it clear that I am not willing to partake in the violence.

4. **Request alternative duties**: Ask to be assigned to non-violent roles such as guarding, transportation, or administrative tasks, emphasizing my willingness to serve in a capacity that does not involve killing.

5. **Seek support from others**: If possible, discreetly connect with other colleagues who also refuse or are sympathetic, to create a small group of individuals standing against participation, thereby reducing individual pressure.

6. **Document my stance**: If feasible, keep a personal record of my refusal or any relevant communications, in case I need to explain my position later or face repercussions.

7. **Prepare for potential consequences**: Mentally and practically prepare for possible punishment or ostracism, and consider options for escape or concealment if the situation becomes dangerous.

8. **Prioritize moral integrity**: Act in accordance with my conscience, understanding that refusal is a moral stance against participating in atrocities, even if it involves personal risk.

These actions are specific, practical steps I would take in that context to refuse participation in mass murder while navigating the environment of coercion and conformity.
