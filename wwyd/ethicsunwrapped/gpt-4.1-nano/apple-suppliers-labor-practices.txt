1. Contact the supplier chain managers and request detailed, up-to-date reports on the origin of all tin used in Apple products for the upcoming quarter. Specifically, verify the mines supplying tin and cross-reference with independent reports on mine safety and labor conditions.

2. Arrange for an independent third-party audit of the tin supply chain in Indonesia, focusing on the mines identified as high-risk, to verify compliance with safety standards and labor laws.

3. Develop a plan to gradually phase out tin sourced from mines with unsafe or child labor practices, prioritizing the transition to ethically certified mines or alternative materials.

4. Allocate a budget to support and partner with organizations working to improve mining conditions in Indonesia, such as funding safety improvements or community development projects.

5. Communicate transparently with consumers by publishing a detailed report on the current status of tin sourcing, the steps Apple is taking to improve conditions, and specific timelines for sourcing from ethical mines.

6. Implement a supplier code of conduct that explicitly prohibits child labor and unsafe working conditions, and require all suppliers to sign and adhere to this code as a condition of continued business.

7. Establish a direct line of communication with local Indonesian NGOs or labor rights organizations to receive ongoing updates and collaborate on initiatives to improve mining safety and labor rights.

8. Set measurable goals for reducing reliance on high-risk mines, such as a target percentage of tin sourced from certified ethical mines within a specified timeframe, and regularly review progress toward these goals.

9. Consider investing in or creating a certification program for ethically sourced tin, and incentivize suppliers to obtain such certifications by offering longer-term contracts or premium payments.

10. If necessary, publicly commit to only sourcing tin from mines that meet strict safety and labor standards, and communicate this commitment to consumers and stakeholders to demonstrate ethical leadership.
