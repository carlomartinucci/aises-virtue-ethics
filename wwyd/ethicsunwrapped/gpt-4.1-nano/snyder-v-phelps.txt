In this scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Coordinate with Law Enforcement:** Contact the local police department to confirm the designated protest area and ensure that Westboro Baptist Church members remain within the permitted 1000-foot radius. Request additional officers if necessary to maintain order and prevent any escalation or harassment.

2. **Establish a Buffer Zone:** Set up a physical buffer zone using barriers or police officers to keep mourners, especially family members like Albert Snyder, at a safe distance from the protesters. This helps prevent confrontations and protects the emotional well-being of the funeral attendees.

3. **Provide Support for the Family:** Arrange for mental health professionals or counselors to be present at the funeral to support grieving family members and friends who may be distressed by the protests. Offer a private space where they can retreat if needed.

4. **Implement a Media Strategy:** Coordinate with media outlets to ensure that coverage of the funeral emphasizes the family's grief and the community's respect, rather than focusing solely on the protests. This can help shape public perception and reduce the impact of the protesters' messages.

5. **Document the Event:** Assign personnel to record the protest activities, including photographs and videos, to document compliance with legal restrictions and any potential misconduct. This documentation can be useful if legal action or complaints arise later.

6. **Communicate with the Protesters:** If possible, have law enforcement or designated officials speak with Westboro members to remind them of the legal boundaries and the importance of respecting the funeral's private nature, even if their speech is protected.

7. **Prepare for Legal and Public Relations Follow-up:** Work with legal counsel to understand the scope of permissible actions and consider filing for an injunction if protesters violate established boundaries. Prepare a public statement emphasizing respect for free speech while condemning harassment.

By executing these concrete steps, I would aim to uphold legal rights, ensure public safety, and protect the emotional well-being of the grieving family and community.
