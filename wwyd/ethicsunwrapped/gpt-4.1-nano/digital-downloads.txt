I would contact the artist or their management directly to express support for fair compensation and inquire about their stance on streaming policies. Specifically, I would:

1. Find the official contact information for Norah Jones or her management team through her official website or social media profiles.
2. Send an email or message expressing appreciation for her perspective on music sharing and her concerns about artist compensation.
3. Ask if she has any ongoing campaigns or initiatives to advocate for fair streaming royalties and how fans can support those efforts.
4. Share the information about Apple’s policy change and her open letter with my network to raise awareness.
5. If possible, participate in or organize a petition or social media campaign calling for streaming services to ensure fair pay for artists, citing her stance as a key example.
6. Support or donate to organizations that advocate for artists’ rights and fair compensation in the digital age.

This approach directly supports the artist’s position, amplifies her message, and encourages industry change through concrete actions.
