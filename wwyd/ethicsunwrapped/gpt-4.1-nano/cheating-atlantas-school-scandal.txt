I would immediately contact the school district’s legal department to report the cheating incident, providing detailed documentation of my actions and observations. I would also request a meeting with the district’s ethics officer or superintendent to disclose my involvement in changing students’ answers, explaining that I did so out of concern for my students’ well-being and the community, but recognizing that it was unethical and illegal. Additionally, I would cooperate fully with any investigations, providing a written statement that clearly states my motivations and actions. If possible, I would seek legal counsel to understand my rights and responsibilities moving forward.
