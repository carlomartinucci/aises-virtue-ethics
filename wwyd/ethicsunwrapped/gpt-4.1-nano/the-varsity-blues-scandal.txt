I would contact the appropriate authorities, such as the FBI or the Department of Justice, to report the specific details of the scheme, including the names of the involved parents, coaches, and Singer himself. I would gather and document all evidence available, such as emails, financial records, and testimonies, to support the investigation. If I have access to any insider information or recordings that could aid the investigation, I would securely share this information with law enforcement. Additionally, I would advise any colleagues or witnesses who have relevant information to come forward and cooperate with the authorities.
