I would immediately report the entire incident to MLB authorities, providing all available evidence, including the PowerPoint presentation, details of the sign-stealing system, and any communications or observations that support the allegations. I would also cooperate fully with the investigation, sharing any additional information or insights I have about the scheme. If I am part of the MLB organization or have access to internal communications, I would document my knowledge and actions taken to ensure transparency and accountability.
