I would contact the South Carolina Department of Archives and History to request the immediate removal of the Confederate flag from the State House grounds. I would then coordinate with law enforcement officials to ensure the flagpole is secured and that the flag is taken down safely and respectfully. After removal, I would arrange for the flag to be properly stored in a secure location, such as an archive or museum, where it can be preserved for historical purposes. Additionally, I would prepare a public statement explaining that the flag has been removed in response to community concerns and to promote healing, emphasizing that the decision was made to foster unity and respect for all citizens.
