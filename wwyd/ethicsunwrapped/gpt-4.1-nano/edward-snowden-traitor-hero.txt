1. **Assess the specific documents involved**: Review the leaked documents to determine which information was disclosed, its sensitivity, and whether any of it directly endangers individuals or national security.

2. **Consult legal counsel**: Contact a qualified legal advisor within the organization or an independent legal expert to understand the legal implications of the leak and explore possible legal channels for whistleblowing.

3. **Report internally**: If possible, report the leak to an internal ethics or compliance office, or to a designated whistleblower protection office, to ensure the issue is formally documented and addressed through official channels.

4. **Identify alternative reporting avenues**: If internal channels are unavailable or untrustworthy, identify external oversight bodies or government agencies (such as the Office of the Inspector General or congressional oversight committees) that handle whistleblower disclosures.

5. **Prepare documentation**: Gather and securely store evidence of the leak, including dates, descriptions of the documents, and any relevant correspondence, to support a formal report.

6. **Make a formal whistleblower report**: Submit a detailed, factual account of the leak to the appropriate external oversight body or legal authority, ensuring that the report emphasizes the potential harm or public interest involved.

7. **Limit further dissemination**: Avoid discussing the leaked information publicly or with unauthorized individuals to prevent additional harm or legal complications.

8. **Seek legal protection**: If available, request whistleblower protections or legal immunity to shield oneself from retaliation or prosecution.

9. **Consider personal safety**: Take precautions to ensure personal security, such as using secure communication channels, anonymizing identity if necessary, and being aware of potential retaliation.

10. **Reflect on personal motivations and consequences**: Before taking action, evaluate the potential personal, legal, and professional consequences, and proceed only if confident that the disclosure aligns with the moral obligation to inform the public and is done through lawful and safe means.
