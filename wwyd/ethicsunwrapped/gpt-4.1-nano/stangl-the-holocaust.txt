1. Obtain detailed records of Franz Stangl’s trial, including court transcripts, evidence presented, and his own statements, to understand the legal and moral context of his conviction.

2. Review historical documentation and testimonies from survivors, witnesses, and experts to verify the extent of his involvement and the nature of his actions at Hartheim, Sobibór, and Treblinka.

3. If I am in a position to do so, contact the relevant authorities or legal institutions involved in his trial to access official case files and evidence.

4. Analyze the evidence to confirm his role in the mass murders and his claims of administrative detachment, ensuring an accurate understanding of his level of responsibility.

5. Based on this analysis, prepare a detailed report summarizing his actions, statements, and the court’s findings, emphasizing the specific crimes committed and his personal accountability.

6. If I am involved in historical or educational work, develop a factual presentation or exhibit that clearly illustrates his role in the Holocaust, including direct quotes and documented actions, to inform others accurately.

7. If I have access to legal or judicial authority, consider whether additional legal actions or memorialization efforts are appropriate to acknowledge the victims and the crimes committed.

8. Avoid any actions that could inadvertently minimize or distort the facts, such as downplaying his involvement or excusing his actions, and focus solely on concrete, evidence-based steps.
