1. Contact the Innocence Project or a similar organization to verify the current status of the case and gather all available evidence, including the original police reports, confessions, and DNA analysis.
2. Request access to the case files, especially the DNA evidence and forensic reports, to review the scientific findings and determine if Reyes’s DNA was tested and properly preserved.
3. Reach out to the New York State DNA forensic laboratory to confirm whether the semen sample was reanalyzed after Reyes’s confession and to obtain the original DNA testing results.
4. Coordinate with a forensic DNA expert to evaluate the original evidence and determine if re-testing the semen sample with current technology could definitively exclude the five young men.
5. Prepare a detailed report summarizing the inconsistencies in the confessions, the lack of physical evidence linking the young men to the crime, and the new DNA evidence linking Reyes to the attack.
6. Contact the current district attorney’s office to present the findings, emphasizing the exoneration evidence and advocating for a formal review or reopening of the case.
7. If the DA’s office is unresponsive or refuses to act, consider filing a motion in court to vacate the convictions based on newly discovered evidence, specifically Reyes’s DNA match.
8. Publicly advocate for a review of the case through media outlets, emphasizing the importance of justice and the wrongful convictions, while providing the evidence and expert opinions obtained.
9. Support or initiate a legal effort to seek a posthumous pardon or exoneration for the five young men, ensuring their innocence is officially recognized.
