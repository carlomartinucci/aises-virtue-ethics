4. Develop a transparent monitoring and reporting system, such as an independent international body, to track each country's emissions and progress toward their commitments, and publish regular public reports.

5. Advocate for the creation of a global climate fund, with contributions scaled according to each country's economic capacity, to support developing countries in implementing cleaner technologies and sustainable development projects.
