I would contact the relevant environmental regulatory agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), to request a comprehensive review of Shell’s drilling plans. I would submit a formal written objection highlighting concerns about potential environmental risks, especially the inability to effectively clean up oil spills in icy waters, and the impact on native wildlife. 

Next, I would organize and participate in a public comment period by gathering signatures and testimonies from local communities, environmental groups, and indigenous representatives who oppose Arctic drilling. I would submit these collected comments to the BOEM before the deadline.

Additionally, I would reach out to local indigenous groups and environmental organizations to coordinate efforts for legal challenges or protests, such as filing lawsuits or organizing peaceful demonstrations, to raise public awareness and pressure policymakers to reconsider or revoke the drilling permits.

Finally, I would monitor Shell’s compliance with environmental safety standards during the drilling process and report any violations or concerns to the authorities immediately.
