1. Immediately halt all use of the Therac-25 machines in the facility to prevent further patient harm.  
2. Notify the hospital’s medical director and the radiation safety officer about the incidents and the machine shutdown.  
3. Document all patient reports, including dates, times, symptoms, and any relevant treatment details, to establish a clear record of incidents.  
4. Isolate the affected machines physically and electronically to prevent accidental reactivation until a thorough safety assessment is completed.  
5. Contact AECL and the manufacturer’s technical support team to request a detailed report on the current status of each machine, including recent repairs, software versions, and safety features.  
6. Arrange for an independent, qualified biomedical engineer or radiation safety expert to inspect each machine for hardware integrity, safety interlocks, and software issues.  
7. Review the inspection reports and verify whether the machines have the latest safety patches and hardware interlocks as recommended by the manufacturer.  
8. Suspend any planned or ongoing treatments involving the Therac-25 until the machines are certified safe by the independent expert.  
9. Report the incidents to the FDA and relevant regulatory authorities, providing all documentation and inspection results.  
10. Develop a protocol for transparent communication with patients who have been treated with the Therac-25, informing them of the incidents and the steps being taken to ensure safety.  
11. Initiate a comprehensive internal investigation into the design, testing, and maintenance procedures related to the Therac-25, focusing on software development, safety testing, and record-keeping practices.  
12. Review and update internal policies to ensure rigorous safety checks, proper documentation, and accountability measures are in place for all medical devices.  
13. Collaborate with regulatory agencies to facilitate a full investigation and ensure compliance with safety standards before resuming use of the machines.  
14. Implement a temporary manual safety check process for all radiation therapy equipment until the machines are fully validated as safe.  
15. Document all actions taken and findings in a detailed report to support transparency, accountability, and future prevention efforts.
