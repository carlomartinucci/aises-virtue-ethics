1. Review the lesson plan and video content: I would examine the specific video used and the context in which it was presented to understand how it was framed and whether it aligns with educational standards and district policies.

2. Meet with the assistant principal and other administrators: I would request a meeting to clarify their concerns, explain my intent in showing the video, and discuss how to address sensitive topics appropriately.

3. Consult with the district’s curriculum coordinator or diversity and inclusion officer: I would seek guidance on best practices for teaching about racial stereotypes and historical representations, ensuring that my approach is educational and respectful.

4. Prepare a clear explanation for future lessons: I would develop a statement or supplementary materials that contextualize sensitive content, emphasizing the educational purpose and historical significance.

5. Communicate with parents and students: I would send a letter or hold a meeting explaining the lesson’s intent, how it fits into the curriculum, and how I aim to foster understanding of historical issues without causing offense.

6. Offer to modify or supplement the lesson: I would propose additional resources or alternative activities that address the same learning objectives but are sensitive to community concerns.

7. Document all steps taken: I would keep records of meetings, communications, and lesson plans to provide transparency and support my professional judgment.

8. If necessary, request a formal review: I would ask the district to review the incident and my teaching practices to ensure fair treatment and adherence to educational standards.

9. Prepare for possible disciplinary action: I would review district policies and, if appropriate, seek support from a union representative or legal counsel to protect my rights.

10. Reflect on and learn from the experience: I would consider how to approach sensitive topics more effectively in the future, possibly through professional development or peer collaboration.
