I would review the current hospital policies and employment contract to confirm whether I am permitted to discuss my reservations about the flu vaccine with patients. If allowed, I would prepare a brief, factual statement explaining that recent studies suggest the flu vaccine's effectiveness varies by age and population, and that some research indicates it may not significantly reduce mortality among the elderly. I would then inform my senior patients during consultations that I have these concerns and recommend they consider discussing the benefits and risks of the flu shot with their personal healthcare providers, emphasizing the importance of making an informed decision based on their individual health status. I would avoid explicitly discouraging vaccination but focus on providing balanced information and encouraging questions. If hospital policies prohibit such discussions, I would document my concerns and seek guidance from the hospital ethics committee or a legal advisor to clarify my rights and responsibilities before proceeding.
