1. Contact the hospital administrator or supervisor directly and request access to the raw, unaltered data on veteran wait times, including the electronic waiting list records and the two sets of books, to verify the actual wait times experienced by veterans.

2. Collaborate with the hospital’s compliance or internal audit department to conduct an independent review of the recorded wait times, comparing the official reports with the raw data and electronic records to identify discrepancies and instances of gaming.

3. Document specific cases where veterans were placed on the electronic waiting list for up to six weeks before being able to call for an appointment, noting the difference between the recorded wait time and the actual wait experienced.

4. Report the findings of the independent review and any discrepancies to the VA’s oversight body or inspector general, including evidence of manipulated data and the use of two sets of books.

5. Recommend implementing a transparent, centralized data system that automatically records the actual date of the first available appointment and the date of the veteran’s appointment, removing manual entry and manipulation.

6. Advocate for immediate suspension of bonuses for administrators until a comprehensive review confirms that wait times are accurately reported and veterans are receiving timely care.

7. If possible, assist in establishing a whistleblower channel or confidential reporting mechanism for staff to report unethical practices without fear of retaliation.

8. Follow up with the VA oversight body or inspector general to ensure that investigations are ongoing and that appropriate disciplinary or corrective actions are taken based on the evidence collected.
