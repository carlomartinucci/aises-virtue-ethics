I would contact the families of the deceased children and adults whose cadavers were used in the research to inform them about the nature of the tests and seek their explicit consent for the continued use of their loved ones' remains. If possible, I would organize a meeting or send detailed written communication explaining the purpose of the research, the potential benefits for public safety, and the measures taken to respect human dignity. I would also offer the families the opportunity to withdraw their loved ones' remains from the study if they object, and ensure that any remaining cadavers are handled with the utmost respect and in accordance with their wishes. Additionally, I would review the universityâ€™s ethical protocols to ensure that consent procedures are properly documented and that future research adheres to strict ethical standards.
