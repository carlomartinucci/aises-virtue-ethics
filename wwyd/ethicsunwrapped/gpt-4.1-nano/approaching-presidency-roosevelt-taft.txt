In this scenario, I would focus on a specific, concrete action aligned with Roosevelt’s stewardship approach, given the context of the question. 

I would:

1. **Identify a pressing national issue** that requires executive action, such as environmental conservation or infrastructure development, where existing laws do not explicitly authorize the action.

2. **Draft an executive order** to establish a new national park or expand an existing one, citing the president’s duty to serve the needs of the nation and the broad authority to act in the public interest, even if the law does not explicitly mandate it.

3. **Consult with relevant agencies** (e.g., the Department of the Interior) to ensure the action is feasible and aligns with the national interest, but avoid seeking explicit legislative approval beforehand, emphasizing the executive’s role in addressing urgent needs.

4. **Publicly announce** the action through a press conference, explaining that the decision is based on the president’s duty to protect natural resources and serve the public good, citing Roosevelt’s philosophy of acting unless explicitly forbidden by law.

5. **Prepare to defend** the action legally if challenged, by framing it as within the broad powers of the presidency to act in the national interest, and emphasizing that the action is consistent with the spirit of existing laws and the Constitution.

This concrete sequence of steps embodies Roosevelt’s approach by proactively using executive authority to address national needs, even in the absence of explicit legal authorization, while communicating the rationale clearly to the public and stakeholders.
