1. Immediately notify the senior management and the risk management department in London about the small loss in the error account, rather than concealing it. Prepare a detailed report explaining the loss, its cause, and the need for oversight.

2. Request an urgent internal audit of Leesonâ€™s trading activities and account records to identify any irregularities or unauthorized trades.

3. Suspend Leeson from trading activities pending investigation, and assign a team of compliance officers to review his trading history and account documentation.

4. Implement stricter oversight protocols for all traders, including real-time monitoring of trading positions and limits, to prevent similar concealment of losses.

5. Conduct a mandatory training session for all trading staff emphasizing transparency, reporting requirements, and the importance of ethical conduct.

6. Review and strengthen internal controls around account management, including mandatory approval for large or unusual trades and regular reconciliation of accounts.

7. Communicate with regulators and auditors about the situation, providing full disclosure of the losses and the steps being taken to address the issue.

8. After the investigation, take disciplinary action against Leeson if misconduct is confirmed, which could include termination of employment and cooperation with legal authorities.

9. Develop a crisis management plan to handle potential fallout from the incident, including public relations strategies and stakeholder communication.

10. Document all actions taken and findings from the investigation to ensure transparency and accountability.
