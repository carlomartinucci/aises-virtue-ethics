I would review the company's internal financial records and correspondence related to Kozlowski’s bonuses, expenses, and transactions to verify whether they were properly authorized and documented. Specifically, I would:

1. Obtain access to the company's financial statements, bonus approval documents, and expense reports from the relevant period.
2. Cross-check the authorized bonuses and expenses against the company's official approval processes and records.
3. Interview the finance and HR personnel involved in approving and processing Kozlowski’s bonuses and expenses to understand the approval chain.
4. Review board meeting minutes or approvals related to the bonuses and personal expenses to determine if proper authorization was given.
5. Document any discrepancies or irregularities found during this review.
6. Prepare a detailed report summarizing whether the transactions were authorized according to company policies and whether any misconduct or unauthorized actions occurred.
7. If irregularities are found, recommend appropriate actions such as reporting to legal counsel, initiating internal investigations, or notifying relevant authorities if criminal activity is suspected.
8. If no irregularities are found, document this conclusion clearly and communicate it to the relevant stakeholders, ensuring transparency and compliance.
