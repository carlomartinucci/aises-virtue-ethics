1. Contact the union representatives and request a meeting with the union leadership to discuss the specific reasons behind their initial refusal and to advocate for a policy that prioritizes authentic casting for future productions.
2. Gather and present data on the limited opportunities for Asian American actors in major roles, including statistics on casting practices in similar productions, to support the argument for racial authenticity.
3. Reach out to Asian American acting organizations and advocacy groups to collaborate on creating a petition or public statement emphasizing the importance of authentic representation and the negative impact of “yellow-face.”
4. Coordinate with the production team to include a statement in the program or during the show’s publicity materials that acknowledges the controversy and affirms a commitment to authentic casting in future projects.
5. Organize a panel discussion or public forum involving actors, union representatives, and cultural critics to openly discuss the issues of racial representation and casting practices in theatre.
6. If possible, identify and audition Asian American actors who meet the desired profile for the role, and present these options to the producers and union as a demonstration of available talent.
7. Document all communications and actions taken to advocate for authentic casting, creating a record that can be used for future advocacy or policy development.
8. After the run, propose a formal review process within the union to establish clear guidelines for casting that promote racial authenticity and prevent “yellow-face” in future productions.
