I would implement a comprehensive safety protocol for NFL games that includes the following specific actions:

1. Enforce stricter penalties for helmet-to-helmet contact and other dangerous plays, with immediate review and suspension of offending players.
2. Mandate the use of advanced helmet technology designed to better absorb and distribute impact forces, and require all players to wear these upgraded helmets.
3. Increase the frequency and scope of sideline concussion assessments using standardized neurocognitive tests administered by trained medical personnel immediately after any suspected impact.
4. Limit the number of plays or snaps a player can participate in per game to reduce cumulative head impacts.
5. Implement mandatory rest periods for players who sustain any head impact, regardless of whether symptoms are present, before they are cleared to return to play.
6. Provide ongoing education for players, coaches, and staff about the risks of head injuries and proper techniques to minimize dangerous impacts.
7. Fund and support independent research on safer playing techniques and equipment, and incorporate findings into rule changes.
8. Publicly disclose injury and concussion data for each game to promote transparency and accountability.
9. Offer long-term health monitoring and support for retired players, including brain health assessments and counseling services.
10. Establish a review board to continuously evaluate new scientific evidence and update safety protocols accordingly.

These actions are specific, actionable steps aimed at reducing the risk of traumatic brain injuries during NFL games.
