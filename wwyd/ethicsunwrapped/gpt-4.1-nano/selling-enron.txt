I would immediately take the following concrete actions:

1. Report the unethical schemes internally: Contact the company's compliance or ethics hotline to report the specific fraudulent activities observed, such as submitting false demand schedules and imaginary transmission schedules. Document all relevant details and communications related to these schemes.

2. Cease participation in illegal activities: Stop engaging in any trading practices or schemes that involve gaming the market, submitting false information, or manipulating prices. Clearly communicate to colleagues that such actions are unethical and must be discontinued.

3. Seek guidance from legal and compliance departments: Request a confidential meeting with the company's legal counsel and compliance officers to clarify the legality of current practices and to understand the company's stance on these activities.

4. Advocate for ethical conduct: Push for the company to implement or strengthen internal controls, audits, and oversight mechanisms to prevent future misconduct. Encourage the leadership to adopt a zero-tolerance policy for market manipulation.

5. Consider whistleblowing externally if internal reporting is ignored: If internal channels are unresponsive or if the company continues to endorse unethical practices, prepare to report the misconduct to external regulators such as the California Public Utilities Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission, providing all documented evidence.

6. Protect personal integrity and legal standing: Keep detailed records of all actions taken and communications made. Consult with an external legal advisor to understand potential liabilities and protections before taking any external whistleblowing steps.

7. Prepare for potential repercussions: Be aware that exposing such practices may lead to retaliation or job loss. Develop a plan to ensure personal safety and financial stability if necessary.

These actions are specific, practical, and directly address the unethical behavior within the context of the scenario.
