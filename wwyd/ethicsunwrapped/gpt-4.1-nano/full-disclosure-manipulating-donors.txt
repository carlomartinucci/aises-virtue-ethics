1. Immediately approach Mary and politely ask to speak with her privately, either by stepping aside or finding a quiet area nearby.
2. Clearly and calmly inform Mary that Robert’s statement about helping “hard-working Americans” does not accurately reflect the shelter’s clientele, which primarily consists of Central American immigrants.
3. Suggest that Mary clarify to Robert that Casa Tia Maria serves immigrants, many of whom are seeking refuge and are not yet U.S. citizens, to ensure the organization’s mission and the clients’ circumstances are accurately represented.
4. Offer to draft a brief, respectful statement or correction that Mary can use to clarify the organization’s mission and the nature of its clients if she chooses to do so.
5. After the conversation, if appropriate, follow up with an email or note to Mary reiterating the importance of transparency and accuracy in donor communications, and offer assistance in preparing any public statements or donor acknowledgments that reflect the true mission of Casa Tia Maria.
6. If Mary refuses or dismisses the concern, consider consulting with a supervisor or another trusted staff member at Casa Tia Maria to ensure the organization’s integrity and the accurate portrayal of its work are maintained.
