1. Review the court documents and the jury’s reasoning to understand the specific elements of “feel” or “vibe” that were deemed infringing.
2. Consult with a musicologist to analyze the similarities between “Blurred Lines” and “Got to Give It Up,” focusing on musical elements such as rhythm, groove, and overall “feel.”
3. If I am a lawyer or legal representative, advise Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams to publicly acknowledge the influence of Marvin Gaye’s music and clarify that their intention was to create an original work inspired by that influence.
4. If I am involved in music production or songwriting, implement a process to document the creative influences and sources for new compositions, including detailed notes on inspiration and references.
5. For future projects, establish a clear review process involving legal and musicological experts to assess potential similarities with existing works before release.
6. If I am part of a record label or management team, develop guidelines and training for artists on how to navigate influence and originality to avoid legal disputes.
7. Consider creating a public statement or educational content explaining the difference between inspiration and infringement, emphasizing respect for original artists while fostering creative expression.
8. If I am a musician or songwriter, seek legal advice before releasing works that are heavily influenced by existing songs, especially when the influence is substantial or recognizable.
9. Engage in open dialogue with the estate of Marvin Gaye or similar rights holders to negotiate licensing or permissions for samples or heavily inspired works, where appropriate.
10. Monitor ongoing legal developments in music copyright law to stay informed about how “feel” and “influence” are being interpreted and applied in court decisions.
