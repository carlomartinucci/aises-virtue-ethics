I would visit a Costco store in person to observe the employee treatment and store operations firsthand. Specifically, I would:

1. Talk to several employees during different shifts to ask about their experiences, focusing on wages, benefits, autonomy, and overall job satisfaction.
2. Observe how employees interact with customers and handle tasks, noting their level of engagement and autonomy.
3. Review publicly available information such as employee reviews on sites like Glassdoor or Indeed to gather additional insights.
4. Examine the store layout and inventory management practices, noting the number of SKUs, pallet stacking, and how employees manage stock.
5. Collect data on employee turnover rates and training programs from company reports or industry sources.
6. Compare these observations with practices at Walmart and Target in similar locations to identify differences in employee treatment and operational complexity.
7. Document my findings with photographs, notes, and direct quotes from employees (with their permission if possible).
8. Summarize how Costco’s practices relate to its business model and whether its success appears linked to its employee treatment or operational complexity.

This concrete approach provides a detailed, practical understanding of Costco’s practices and their impact on success.
