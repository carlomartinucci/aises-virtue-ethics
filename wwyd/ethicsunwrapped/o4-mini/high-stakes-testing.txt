I would take these concrete steps as a parent in Celina, Texas, this spring:  
1. Draft and send a formal “opt-out” letter by certified mail to my campus principal and to Superintendent O’Dell before the district’s testing-materials deadline (I’d cite the relevant Texas Education Code provision that allows parents to refuse state-mandated exams).  
2. Create a one-page fact sheet summarizing three peer-reviewed studies on the harms of high-stakes testing and the benefits of portfolio-based assessment.  
3. Organize a meeting in my living room for other interested parents—send personal invitations to families I know and post an event link in local parent-teacher social media groups. At that meeting I’ll:  
   • Hand out copies of the opt-out letter template so each family can immediately complete and sign it.  
   • Distribute the fact sheet and walk everyone through its key data points.  
   • Collect signed opt-out letters on the spot, then scan and e-mail them to district officials that evening so there’s a time-stamped record.  
4. Within 48 hours of our meeting, request a 5-minute slot on the next Celina ISD board-meeting agenda. In that slot I’ll:  
   • Read aloud the names of all families who have opted out so far.  
   • Present the one-page fact sheet on portfolio assessments.  
   • Politely ask the board to vote on a district pilot allowing 5th-grade students to substitute a portfolio of class projects for one state-mandated test next year.  
5. Follow up the next morning by e-mailing each board member my scanned petition (with all parent signatures) and attach a simple 2-column budget showing how existing classroom-materials funds could cover rubrics, training, and project-supplies for a 30-student pilot.
