I’d step into Ryan Lochte’s shoes as his PR lead and execute the following plan the morning after his NBC interview:

1. Book a 30-minute studio session by 9 AM with a videographer and sound engineer.  
2. Draft a six-bullet script that:  
   • Lists exactly what happened at the gas station (no “police,” no “gun to my head”).  
   • Admits he left out details because he was disoriented from drinking.  
   • Offers a clear timeline (“We left the party at 2:15 AM, taxi broke down at 2:30 AM…”).  
   • Apologizes directly to Brazilians, teammates, sponsors and fans.  
3. Have Ryan rehearse that script twice on camera to ensure his tone is contrite but steady.  
4. Finalize the cut by noon, export versions optimized for NBC (full HD, 16×9), Instagram (square), Twitter (under 140 seconds).  
5. At 1 PM, distribute the video file and a one-paragraph fact sheet to:  
   • Matt Lauer’s team at NBC, with a request to post it as an update to last night’s segment.  
   • Editors at The New York Times, USA Today and Reuters, with the offer of a 10-minute follow-up phone call.  
   • All four swimmers’ personal social accounts.  
6. Immediately after posting, sendRyan to the local community pool in Rio at 3 PM for a 45-minute youth swimming clinic, wearing his Olympic gear, and have photographers capture him teaching starts and turns.  
7. By 6 PM, issue a press release through USA Swimming headquarters summarizing the video, the clinic, and confirming that he will fulfill all community-service requirements in the next four months.

This tightly scripted sequence ensures the public sees a factual correction, a direct apology, and tangible reparative action—all delivered within the same business day.
