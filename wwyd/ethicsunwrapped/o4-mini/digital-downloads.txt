I’m the digital‐partnership manager at a mid-size record label. Here’s exactly what I’d do to ensure artists get paid during any “free” trial period:

1. Extract last-quarter streaming data   
   – Pull raw play counts and revenue figures for all our artists from Spotify, Apple Music, etc.   
   – Identify which services ran unpaid trial campaigns and for how long.

2. Build a “trial‐period impact” model in Excel   
   – Calculate the difference between standard per-stream rates and $0 for each month of unpaid trial.   
   – Project total revenue shortfall per artist for a 3-month trial on a platform with our 2 million active listeners.

3. Draft specific contract amendments   
   – Write a one-page addendum stipulating a minimum “trial-user payout” equal to 25% of standard per-stream rates or a $0.003 minimum fee, whichever is higher.   
   – Include a reporting clause requiring weekly play metrics for trial accounts.

4. Secure internal sign-off   
   – Send the model and draft addendum to our CFO and General Counsel by 10 AM tomorrow.   
   – Schedule a 30-minute review call for 2 PM to address any legal or financial concerns.

5. Open negotiations with the platform   
   – Email our Apple Music partnerships contact before COB today: attach the impact model and addendum draft.   
   – Propose a call for Friday at 11 AM to finalize terms.

6. Finalize and implement   
   – On the call, walk through each line of the addendum, emphasize our data-driven revenue projections.   
   – Agree on an implementation date; update our in-house distribution system to flag trial streams for the new rate.   
   – Notify all signed artists via our quarterly newsletter that the amendment is in place and explain how to read their next royalty statement.

By the end of next week we’ll have a binding amendment ensuring artists earn at least a pro-rated fee—even during free trials.
