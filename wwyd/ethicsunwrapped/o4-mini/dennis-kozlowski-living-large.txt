I would immediately convene Tyco’s audit committee and, within 24 hours, issue a formal mandate to the corporate controller’s office to do the following:  
1. Pull every corporate‐charged expense and credit‐card transaction under Dennis Kozlowski’s name (including his wife’s) from 1992 through 2002.  
2. Deliver that raw data—date, vendor, amount, cost-center code and attached invoice/image—to an external forensic‐accounting firm we retain by Tuesday morning.  
3. Simultaneously instruct IT to preserve and mirror Kozlowski’s e-mail folders, expense-report system logs and Board-presentation archives.  

By next Thursday, the forensic team must produce a “red‐flag” schedule of all transactions over $10,000 that lack a corresponding Board resolution or business‐travel approval, then present those findings in person at the audit‐committee meeting.
