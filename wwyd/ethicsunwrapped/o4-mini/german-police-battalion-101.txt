I would claim the “other duties” option and take a guard/transport assignment instead of participating in the shooting. Concretely, on the morning we reach Józefów:  
1. Wait until the commander finishes his briefing.  
2. Step forward, make eye contact with him, and say in a clear voice, “Sir, I’m not up to the shooting detail—please assign me to guard or transport duty.”  
3. When he nods, salute and move straight to the transport wagons with my rifle slung over my shoulder—no hesitation, no looking back at the execution site.  
4. Find the sergeant in charge of the carriages, introduce myself by rank and name, and ask which horses or wagons I’m to oversee.  
5. Spend the operation standing beside the wagons, checking harnesses and keeping the horses calm, deliberately staying out of the firing line until we break camp.
