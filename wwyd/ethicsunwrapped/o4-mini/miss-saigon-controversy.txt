I’d commission and run a dedicated, open audition for “the Engineer” restricted to actors of full or mixed Asian heritage—here’s exactly how:  
1. By next Monday I’d email casting notices to at least five Asian-American theatre organizations (for example, the National Asian Artists Project, East West Players, Pan Asian Rep, Ma-Yi Theatre Company, and the Asian American Performers Action Coalition) with sides from the show and a deadline two weeks out.  
2. I’d book audition rooms in New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco for the two weekends following that deadline.  
3. I’d assemble a three-person panel that includes an established Asian or Eurasian director (e.g., BD Wong or another credentialed actor-director) alongside our casting team.  
4. We’d require each actor to submit a 1–2-minute video of the Engineer’s first big monologue plus a headshot/resume, then invite at least 30 of those applicants to in-person auditions during those weekend slots.  
5. By the following Monday we’d meet, score every in-person audition against the same rubric (vocal strength, character instincts, physicality) and confirm our top choice—ensuring that the role goes to an actor of genuine Asian heritage.
