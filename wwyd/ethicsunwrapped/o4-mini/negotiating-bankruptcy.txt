I would immediately file a supplemental Rule 2014 disclosure with the bankruptcy court.  Concretely, I’d prepare an amended “Statement of Attorney” under 11 U.S.C. § 327 and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 2014(a) that:

1. Lists South Street and Mikael Salovaara as existing Milbank Tweed clients;  
2. Attaches the original engagement letters or retainer agreements for both South Street and Salovaara;  
3. Explains the nature of the work Milbank has done for each over the past year;  
4. Serves the amended statement on the U.S. Trustee, BE, Jackson National Life, South Street, Salovaara, and the official creditors’ committee;  
5. Notices a short hearing (e.g. 14-day notice) to obtain the court’s approval of Milbank Tweed’s continued representation.  

That single step cures the nondisclosure by putting the court and all parties on formal notice of the potential conflict.
