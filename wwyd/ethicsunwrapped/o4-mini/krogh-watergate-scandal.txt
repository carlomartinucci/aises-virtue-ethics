At the moment Ehrlichman lays out the plan, I would stop the meeting and say, “I’m not moving forward with this unless we have a court‐issued warrant or grand‐jury subpoena for Dr. Rosen’s records.” Then I’d pull out my notebook, draft a two‐page memo on the spot, cite 18 U.S.C. § 2110 et seq. (burglary of government offices) and the psychiatrist–patient privilege under Rule 1.6 of the ABA Model Rules, and hand it to Ehrlichman. Next, I’d walk that memo over to the White House Counsel’s office, leave it on their desk, and ask for an immediate legal opinion. If they refused to get me a warrant or opinion within 24 hours, I’d hand back my assignment sheet, tell them “I must recuse myself,” and refuse to participate further.
