I would take the following concrete steps before replaying any archival blackface clips in class:

1. Draft and circulate a “Lesson‐Content Disclosure Packet” 72 hours before the day of the lesson.  In that packet I would include:  
   • A one‐page rationale explaining exactly why the 1930s blackface clip is being shown (to illustrate minstrel stereotypes and their impact on Jim Crow laws), with time stamps for key segments.  
   • A copy of the full video URL and exact start/stop times I plan to use (so observers know I’m not randomly showing offensive material).  
   • The slide deck or outline of my lecture and guided discussion questions.  
   • A simple two‐question feedback form so parents or administrators can flag concerns in writing by a set deadline.  

2. Email that packet simultaneously to:  
   • The assistant principal (as the official observer),  
   • My department chair or curriculum coordinator,  
   • Every parent or guardian of students in the class.  

3. Require written acknowledgement—either an opt-in signed consent for students to view the clip, or an opt-out alternative assignment (e.g., analyze a primary‐source political cartoon on segregation).  

4. Hold a 10-minute “pre‐view” meeting with the assistant principal two days before the lesson to walk her through:  
   • The precise video segment,  
   • The historical documents we’ll pair it with,  
   • The in-class debrief questions.  

5. On lesson day, start by reminding students that some images are disturbing, then play only the approved clip. Immediately follow with small‐group work on a primary‐source Jim Crow segregation law. Collect quick exit tickets: “Name one harmful stereotype you saw in the clip and one question you have.”  

6. After class, upload student exit tickets to our shared drive and send a 24-hour “Lesson Recap” email to the assistant principal and parents summarizing how the clip was used and what students learned.
