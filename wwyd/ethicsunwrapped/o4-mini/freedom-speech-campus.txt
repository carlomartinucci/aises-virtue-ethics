I’m assuming the role of an associate master at Yale’s residential college in the wake of the Christakis e-mail controversy. Here’s one concrete set of actions I would take:

1. Within 48 hours, I would reserve our dining hall for a 90-minute “Safe Voices Forum.”  
2. I’d hire a neutral facilitator from Yale’s Office of Student Conflict Resolution.  
3. I’d invite by name:  
   • Ten students who signed the open letter (two from each “cultural affinity” student group)  
   • Five RAs and four residential‐college fellows (including Erika Christakis)  
4. I’d circulate an agenda in advance:  
   a. 10 min – facilitator reads ground rules (no interruptions, 2-minute speaker limit)  
   b. 30 min – each student activist describes one moment in which an email or administrative message made them feel “invalidated.”  
   c. 30 min – fellows respond with one concrete policy proposal each (e.g., clear Halloween‐costume guidelines, mandatory bias‐awareness training for fellows).  
   d. 20 min – open floor, capturing proposals on a whiteboard.  
5. I’d assign follow-ups at the end of the session:  
   • By end of Day 3: I will collate the whiteboard notes into a one-page “Action Brief.”  
   • By Day 7: I’ll send that brief—with dates and responsible offices—to every forum attendee, Residential Life, the Dean of Students, and Yale’s PR office.  
   • By Day 14: I will meet again with the same group to vote on the top three proposals and finalize a timeline (e.g., “New costume guidelines published October 15,” “Bias training rolled out November 1”).  
6. I will publish those dates and responsible names on our college website’s front page under a banner reading “Building Respectful Dialogue.”  

This sequence ensures affected students see immediate scheduling of a structured conversation, clear documentation of their concerns, and a binding timeline with named offices accountable for concrete changes.
