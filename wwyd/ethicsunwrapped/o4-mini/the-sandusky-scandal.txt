I would grab my phone right away, dial the State College police non-emergency line (814-234-7150), and say:  
“Hello, I need to file a report of suspected child sexual abuse. On February 14, 2001, in the Lasch Building locker-room shower, I personally witnessed Jerry Sandusky fondling a minor under the age of 12. The victim’s name is John Doe, DOB 3/12/1989. I’m prepared to give a full written statement and to testify. Please send an officer to take my report now.”  
Then, before hanging up, I’d note the name and badge number of the officer I spoke with, request a case number, and immediately follow up by e-mailing that same report in writing to the Pennsylvania child-abuse hotline (childline.state.pa.us) so there’s both a police record and a CPS record.
