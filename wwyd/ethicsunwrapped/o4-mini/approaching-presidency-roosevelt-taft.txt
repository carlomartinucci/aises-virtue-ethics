I would take these concrete steps:

1. Convene a White House “Trust Regulation Task Force” next Monday at 10 AM, composed of the Attorney General, the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior, and two antitrust economists from the Department of Justice (DOJ).  
2. Direct the Task Force at that meeting to draft, within four weeks, a “Trust Classification and Oversight Bill” that:  
   a. Defines clear, measurable thresholds for market‐share, price‐fixing, and vertical integration that distinguish “bad” trusts from “good” ones.  
   b. Establishes a streamlined DOJ procedure for investigating alleged monopoly practices, including mandatory document subpoenas within 30 days of opening a case.  
   c. Creates a “Consent Decree Track” whereby corporations under investigation may propose binding remedies—such as divestiture plans or rate caps—subject to DOJ approval.  
3. While the bill is being drafted, instruct the Attorney General to open a formal inquiry into U.S. Steel’s 1901–1908 mergers by issuing subpoenas this week for internal board minutes, acquisition contracts, and profit‐margin data. Set a 60-day deadline for U.S. Steel to comply.  
4. In parallel, schedule a November special session of Congress, send a detailed letter of transmittal to House and Senate leaders by September 15, and attach the Task Force’s interim report outlining why existing statutes leave “gray areas” that the new bill will resolve.  
5. On November 10, deliver a joint appearance before the House Judiciary and Senate Commerce Committees to walk them through the draft bill line by line, answer legislators’ technical questions, and solicit one or two amendments that could secure a bipartisan supermajority.  
6. As soon as Congress passes the Trust Classification and Oversight Bill, sign it immediately and direct the DOJ to reopen the U.S. Steel inquiry under the new standards, using the Consent Decree Track if the company proposes corrective measures.
