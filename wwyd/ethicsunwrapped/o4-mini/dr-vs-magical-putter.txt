I would immediately revise the online Grantland article to remove every reference to Dr. Vanderbilt’s deadname or prior gender history—leaving in only the facts about her academic and financial misrepresentations—and then publish, at the top of the story, a clear editor’s note that reads something like:

“Editor’s note, [date]: We have removed details of Dr. Vanderbilt’s gender history and previous name, which were included against her wishes and are not material to the story’s focus on her work and funding. We apologize for harming her privacy and for any distress we caused to the transgender community. Going forward, we will seek consent before publishing personal identity details that do not bear on a subject’s professional claims.”

This single concrete action both corrects the published record and acknowledges the specific harm caused.
