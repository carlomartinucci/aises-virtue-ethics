I would slip out of the ballroom lobby, spot Robert near the elevators, and say:  
“Mr. Thompson, I’m Jenny, the new fundraising intern at Casa Tía María—thank you so much for your gift. Before you go, I want to clarify something important: our shelter serves newly arrived Central American immigrants, not U.S.-born citizens. I realize Mary’s description left that out. Is supporting those families—helping them learn English, find jobs, and secure housing—still in line with your giving priorities? If so, I’ll confirm today that your check funds our English-and-job-prep program. If not, I can arrange a refund or redirect to a program you prefer.”
