I would equip each ballpark with a handheld radio-frequency scanner and train two clubhouse attendants per game to run an unannounced sweep of the dugout and bullpen each inning. As soon as the scanner picks up any signal in the 200â€“400 MHz range (the band used by most consumer RF transmitters), the attendant immediately powers down all non-league-issued electronics, seals the dugout entrance, and radios the crew chief to confiscate and inventory any devices before play resumes.
