I would convene an emergency meeting of Heidelberg’s Research Ethics Committee and, by the end of the week, issue a binding “Cadaver-Crash-Test Approval Protocol” that:

1. Requires every single donor file to contain – in the donor’s own handwriting or, if they signed years ago, in a notarized addendum from next of kin – the explicit statement “I consent to the use of my (or my child’s) body in motor-vehicle impact research.”  
2. Bars any further crash tests on cadavers until a stamped, signed copy of that consent form is on record in the pathology department.  
3. Assigns one staff member in the Ethics Office to cross-check every donor consent form against the upcoming test schedule; if even one test lacks matching consent, the entire series of planned impacts is postponed.  
4. Publishes, on the university website within 48 hours, a redacted log showing for each future test: cadaver ID (anonymized), date of test, model of vehicle impact, and confirmation that consent is on file.
