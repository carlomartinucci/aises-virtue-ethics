I’d treat the store itself as the intervention point. Here’s one concrete plan I’d put in place next week:

1. Institute a mandatory reusable‐bag rule.  
   – At every entrance, install two signs: “Today onward, BYO bag or pay $0.10 per single‐use bag.”  
   – Configure our POS registers so that if a cashier rings up an item without a customer‐supplied bag, the system auto-adds a 10¢ bag fee.  

2. Retrain all cashiers (using a 30-minute huddle) to:  
   a. Greet every customer with, “Welcome back! Did you bring your reusable bags today?”  
   b. Politely apply the 10¢ fee if no bag is presented.  

3. Replace all “bring‐your‐own‐bag” displays by the produce section with a single poster reading “Store Policy: Reusable Bags Required.” Remove any “optional” language.  

4. Launch an 8-week sales-tracking project:  
   – Pull daily till data on (a) reusable‐bag compliance rate, (b) sales of eco-friendly items, and (c) sales of high-calorie indulgences (ice cream, cookies, candy, cake).  
   – Compare average weekly indulgence sales from the 8 weeks before the policy with the 8 weeks after implementation.  

By stripping customers of “choice” about bags and making bag use compulsory, I would anticipate the moral-licensing boost in indulgent purchases to disappear—just as the researchers found.
