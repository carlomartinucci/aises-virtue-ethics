I would draft and send a licensing‐offer email directly to Mannie Garcia:  
1. Attach a one‐page draft agreement granting me a non‐exclusive, worldwide right to use and transform his 2006 Obama photo in up to 100,000 posters and related merchandise.  
2. Offer a $5,000 up-front fee plus 5% of net sales on any poster run over 50,000 prints.  
3. Spell out key terms: scope (print and digital posters), territory (worldwide), duration (in perpetuity), payment schedule (50% on signing, balance on first print run).  
4. Include mock-up images showing exactly how I’ll abstract and recolor the photo.  
5. Request his signature via DocuSign within two weeks so I can begin artwork production without infringing his copyright.
