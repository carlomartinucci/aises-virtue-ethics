I’d immediately set up a narrowly-scoped, time-bound review of the pardon process to undercut rumors of a secret deal and show the public we’re serious about transparency.  Here’s exactly what I would do as White House chief of staff on September 9, 1974:  
1. Draft and issue an Executive Order establishing the “Special Review Panel on Executive Pardons” with these terms:  
   • Co-chairs: Senator John Sherman Cooper (R–KY) and Senator George McGovern (D–SD)  
   • Two additional members: the sitting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia and a retired federal judge  
   • Mandate: audit all documents and tape transcripts related to the Nixon pardon, interview President Ford and five key aides (e.g. Dick Cheney’s office, Chief Counsel Fred Fielding), and review Health and Justice Department memoranda.  
   • Deadline: Interim public briefing 30 days after appointment; final report delivered to Congress and released to the press in 60 days.  

2. That afternoon, circulate the Executive Order to the White House counsel’s office for formal clearance, then send it to the Federal Register.  

3. Simultaneously, notify Senators Cooper and McGovern by secure phone call—ask for their immediate acceptance, schedule the first Panel meeting for September 16, and direct each senator’s staff to begin document collection from the National Archives and Department of Justice.  

4. Prepare and distribute a tightly choreographed press notice for 5 p.m. that day announcing the Panel’s creation, its membership, its express 60-day deadline and its public-report requirement.  

5. Book the Oval Office for President Ford’s statement at 6 p.m. on September 10. In the script, Ford will say:  
   “To ensure the American people know there was no back-room bargain in my pardon of President Nixon, I’ve launched this bipartisan panel with strict deadlines and a commitment to full public disclosure of its findings.”  

By taking these steps, we’d both quiet the most explosive conspiracy theories and demonstrate a genuine shift toward openness—without bogging the administration down in endless partisan fights over Watergate.
