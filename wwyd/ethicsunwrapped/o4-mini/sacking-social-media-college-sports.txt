I would roll out a live social-media monitoring and response protocol using UDiligence, as follows:  

1. At our first team meeting (August 1), require every athlete to submit a list of their active social-media handles (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook).  
2. Within 48 hours, have our compliance coordinator onboard those handles into UDiligence and activate two keyword tiers:  
   • Tier 1 (automatic alerts): “arrest,” “agent,” “brawl,” “party,” “drugs,” “sex,” “meal”  
   • Tier 2 (daily digest): profanity, hate-speech slurs, NCAA-related terms (e.g. “eligibility,” “bonus”)  
3. Each morning, the compliance coordinator reviews all Tier 1 alerts; if an athlete’s post is flagged, she:  
   a. Schedules a one-on-one meeting with that athlete within 24 hours  
   b. Logs the date, keyword triggered, and a 2–3-sentence summary of the discussion in our “Social Media Log” spreadsheet  
   c. Sends a follow-up e-mail within 12 hours outlining any corrective steps (e.g. post removal, apology tweet) and deadlines  
4. Every Friday afternoon, the coordinator compiles the Tier 2 digest into a two-paragraph “Team Social Media Health” memo and distributes it to coaches and compliance staff—no player names included.  
5. At the end of each semester, we audit the Social Media Log to identify recurring issues, adjust our keyword lists, and propose any needed handbook language updates for the next year.
