I would issue an immediate editorial directive to strip out every graphic detail of Robin Williams’s method—no description of ligature placement, neck anatomy, or how the knot was tied—and replace it with a single line saying “Williams’s death has been ruled a suicide.” At the bottom of the story I’d add a 50-word boxed note linking to the Suicide Prevention Lifeline (in the U.S., 988) and equivalent international hotlines.
