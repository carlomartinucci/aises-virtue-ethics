I would draft and launch an online petition on Change.org calling for my city council to ban bullfighting.  Steps:  
1. Write a 200-word petition statement summarizing bulls’ suffering and listing three local anti-bullfighting cities as precedents.  
2. Publish it on Change.org under the title “Ban Bullfighting in [City Name]” and set a goal of 10,000 signatures in 30 days.  
3. Post the petition link to three local Facebook community groups and to Instagram with the hashtags #NoBullfighting and #[CityName]AnimalRights.  
4. Email the petition to the five nearest animal-welfare NGOs, asking them to share it with their mailing lists.  
5. After reaching 10,000 signatures, print the petition with a one-page summary of endorsing organizations and deliver it in person to City Hall before the next council meeting.
