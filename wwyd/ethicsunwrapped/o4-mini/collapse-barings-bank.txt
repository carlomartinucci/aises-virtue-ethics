I would immediately pull together a fresh, up-to-the-minute profit-and-loss spreadsheet for the Singapore desk—showing every trade, every hidden error-account entry and its running total. Then, before the market close, I’d send a single email to my direct London supervisor and to the head of internal audit with subject line “URGENT: Full P&L and Error-Account Disclosure—Singapore Trading,” attach that spreadsheet, and in the body say: “I request a 30-minute video call today at 17:00 GMT to walk through these figures and agree next steps.”
