I would build and deploy a “Pet-Product Demo” mobile pop-up van wrapped in the In-FUR campaign art and schedule it for a 12-week tour through the five Clark County ZIP codes with the lowest adoption rates. Steps:  
1. Outfit a 16-ft van with a small “adoption nook” (table, chairs, kennel), on-board tablet for digital intake forms, and branded vinyl showing “Pet Vacuum,” “Pet Alarm,” etc.  
2. Secure permits to park Friday–Sunday afternoons outside three high-traffic spots per weekend (e.g., shopping centers in 89115, 89107, 89121).  
3. Hire two part-time adoption counselors and one logistics driver.  
4. Promote each weekend stop via geo-targeted Facebook and Instagram ads (10-mile radius), with a “Meet Fluffy the Vacuum Dog” event page.  
5. At each stop, demonstrate one “utility” trick (e.g., dog fetching mail) on camera; immediately post the footage as Instagram Reels with a “Book an Adoption Meet-and-Greet” link.  
6. Use the tablet to capture visitors’ contact info and interest level; automatically send a “Your Meet-and-Greet is Confirmed” email with a calendar link.  
7. At week’s end, pull data on leads generated and on-site adoptions; adjust next weekend’s location or “gadget demo” based on which utility bit drove the most sign-ups.
