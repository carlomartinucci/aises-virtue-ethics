In this scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Facilitate a Private Discussion**: I would arrange a private meeting with the student who posted the hurtful messages. This would allow for a more constructive conversation without the pressure of peers present. 

2. **Educate on Consequences**: During this meeting, I would explain the impact of her words, not just on the teacher but on the broader community. I would share examples of how cyberbullying can lead to serious consequences, including emotional distress and reputational harm.

3. **Encourage Empathy**: I would ask the student to consider how she would feel if someone spoke about her in a similar manner. This would help her understand the emotional weight of her actions.

4. **Request a Written Apology**: Instead of demanding a public apology, I would ask the student to write a sincere apology letter to the teacher. This would allow her to reflect on her actions and express her regret in a more thoughtful manner.

5. **Involve Parents**: I would reach out to the student’s parents to inform them of the situation and encourage them to discuss the importance of respectful communication with their child.

6. **Implement a Class Discussion**: I would organize a class discussion on social media etiquette and the importance of kindness online, ensuring that all students understand the potential harm of their words and the importance of empathy.

7. **Monitor Future Behavior**: I would keep an eye on the student’s behavior moving forward, providing support and guidance as needed to help her learn from this experience.

By taking these steps, I would aim to address the issue constructively while promoting a culture of respect and understanding in the classroom.
