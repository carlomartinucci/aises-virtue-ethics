In response to the issues surrounding social media use by college athletes, I would implement a structured social media education program for the athletes at the university. This program would include the following specific actions:

1. **Develop a Curriculum**: Create a curriculum that covers the potential risks and benefits of social media, including case studies of past incidents involving athletes. This would help athletes understand the consequences of their online behavior.

2. **Mandatory Workshops**: Organize mandatory workshops at the beginning of each semester for all student-athletes. These workshops would focus on responsible social media use, privacy settings, and the impact of online posts on personal and team reputation.

3. **Guest Speakers**: Invite former athletes, social media experts, and legal advisors to speak about their experiences and the importance of maintaining a positive online presence.

4. **Create Guidelines**: Develop clear social media guidelines that outline acceptable and unacceptable behaviors, which would be distributed to all athletes and included in the student-athlete handbook.

5. **Ongoing Support**: Establish a support system where athletes can seek advice on social media issues, including a designated staff member who can provide guidance and answer questions.

6. **Monitoring and Feedback**: Implement a system for monitoring social media activity, not to punish athletes, but to provide constructive feedback and mentorship. This could involve periodic reviews of public posts and discussions about any concerning content.

By taking these concrete steps, I would aim to educate athletes on the responsible use of social media while allowing them to express themselves in a way that aligns with the values of the university and its athletic program.
