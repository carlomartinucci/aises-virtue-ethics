In this scenario, if I were in a position to influence the situation, I would take the following specific action: I would publicly advocate for the establishment of a clear and enforceable code of conduct regarding social interactions between Supreme Court justices and parties involved in cases before them. This code would include guidelines on when justices should recuse themselves from cases to maintain public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process. I would work with legal ethics experts, lawmakers, and advocacy groups to draft this code and push for its adoption, ensuring that it addresses potential conflicts of interest and promotes transparency in the judicial system.
