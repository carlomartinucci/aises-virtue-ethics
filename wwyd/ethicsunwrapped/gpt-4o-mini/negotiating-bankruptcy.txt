In this scenario, if I were in Gellene's position and realized that I had failed to disclose a potential conflict of interest regarding Milbank Tweed's representation of both South Street and Salovaara, I would take the following specific action:

I would immediately file a motion with the bankruptcy court to amend the previous disclosures made under oath. In this motion, I would explicitly outline the connections between Milbank Tweed, South Street, and Salovaara, and explain the reasons for the initial oversight. I would also request that the court consider this new information in light of the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings and seek guidance on how to proceed in a manner that upholds the integrity of the process. This action would demonstrate transparency and a commitment to rectifying the oversight, potentially mitigating any legal repercussions.
