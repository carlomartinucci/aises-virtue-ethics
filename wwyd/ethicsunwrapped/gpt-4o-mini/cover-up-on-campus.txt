In this scenario, if I were in a position of authority at Baylor University during the time of the incidents, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Establish a Mandatory Reporting Policy**: I would implement a clear and strict mandatory reporting policy for all coaches and staff within the athletics department. This policy would require that any allegations of sexual assault or misconduct involving student-athletes be reported immediately to the Title IX office, regardless of the circumstances or the perceived severity of the incident.

2. **Conduct Training Sessions**: I would organize mandatory training sessions for all coaching staff and athletic department personnel on Title IX compliance, sexual assault awareness, and the importance of supporting victims. This training would emphasize the legal obligations of staff to report incidents and the potential consequences of failing to do so.

3. **Create an Independent Oversight Committee**: I would establish an independent oversight committee to monitor the athletics department's compliance with Title IX and to ensure that all reports of misconduct are handled appropriately. This committee would include external experts in Title IX and sexual violence prevention.

4. **Implement a Whistleblower Policy**: I would create a whistleblower policy that protects individuals who report misconduct from retaliation. This would encourage more people to come forward with information about any inappropriate behavior or cover-ups within the athletics program.

5. **Enhance Support Services for Victims**: I would ensure that there are adequate support services available for victims of sexual assault, including counseling, legal assistance, and advocacy. This would help create a safer environment for students to report incidents without fear of stigma or retaliation.

6. **Regularly Review and Audit Compliance**: I would mandate regular audits of the athletics department's handling of Title IX cases and compliance with university policies. This would help identify any ongoing issues and ensure accountability at all levels of the program.

By taking these concrete actions, I would aim to create a culture of accountability and support within the athletics department, prioritizing the safety and well-being of all students.
