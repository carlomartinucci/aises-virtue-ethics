In the context of the scenario involving Egil “Bud” Krogh and the illegal break-in at Daniel Ellsberg’s psychiatrist's office, if I were in Krogh's position during the meeting where the break-in was proposed, I would take the following specific action:

I would voice my concerns about the legality and morality of the proposed break-in during the meeting. I would explicitly state that the operation could be illegal and that it risks significant consequences for all involved, including potential legal repercussions and damage to our integrity as public servants. I would suggest that we seek legal counsel to assess the implications of the operation before proceeding, emphasizing the importance of adhering to the law and ethical standards in our actions. If the group continued to dismiss these concerns, I would refuse to participate in the operation and document my objections in writing to ensure there is a record of my dissent.
