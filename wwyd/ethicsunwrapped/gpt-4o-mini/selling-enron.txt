In this scenario, if I were an employee at Enron and became aware of the unethical and potentially illegal practices being employed, I would take the following specific action: I would document all instances of unethical behavior and the details of the schemes being implemented, including dates, involved parties, and the nature of the activities. 

Once I had gathered sufficient evidence, I would report these findings to the internal compliance department or ethics hotline within Enron, ensuring that I followed the proper channels for whistleblowing as outlined by the company. If the internal reporting did not lead to any corrective action or if I feared retaliation, I would then consider escalating the matter to external regulatory bodies, such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), to report the unethical practices and seek intervention. 

This approach would aim to address the unethical behavior while protecting myself as much as possible within the corporate structure.
