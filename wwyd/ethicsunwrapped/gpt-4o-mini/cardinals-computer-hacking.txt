2. **Cooperate with Authorities**: I would cooperate fully with the FBI and any other investigative bodies. This would involve providing complete transparency about my actions, including how I accessed the Astros' systems and what information I obtained.

3. **Seek Legal Counsel**: I would immediately seek legal counsel to understand the ramifications of my actions and to navigate the legal proceedings effectively.

4. **Engage in Restitution**: I would work towards making restitution to the Astros, not just financially but also by publicly acknowledging the harm caused and expressing remorse for my actions.

5. **Reflect and Learn**: While serving my sentence, I would engage in self-reflection and seek educational opportunities related to ethics in technology and sports management, aiming to understand the broader implications of my actions.

6. **Public Apology**: Upon release, I would issue a public apology to the Astros, the Cardinals, and the MLB community, taking responsibility for my actions and expressing a commitment to ethical behavior in the future.

7. **Advocate for Ethical Standards**: I would use my experience to advocate for stronger ethical standards and practices within sports organizations, possibly by speaking at events or writing about the importance of integrity in sports.

By taking these actions, I would aim to address the consequences of my actions and contribute positively to the conversation around ethics in sports and technology.
