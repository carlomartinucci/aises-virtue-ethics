In this scenario, if I were in a position to influence the situation, I would take the following specific action: I would initiate an internal audit of Tyco International's financial practices and executive compensation policies. This audit would be conducted by an independent third-party firm to ensure objectivity and transparency. 

The audit would focus on the following areas:

1. **Review of Executive Compensation**: Analyze all executive compensation packages, including bonuses, perks, and any other financial benefits, to determine if they were in line with company policy and shareholder interests.

2. **Examine Corporate Governance**: Assess the effectiveness of the board of directors in overseeing executive actions and ensuring compliance with corporate governance standards.

3. **Investigate Financial Transactions**: Scrutinize the financial records related to the alleged unauthorized bonuses and personal expenses to clarify the legitimacy of these transactions.

4. **Report Findings**: Compile a comprehensive report detailing the findings of the audit, including any discrepancies or violations of company policy, and present it to the board of directors and shareholders.

5. **Implement Recommendations**: Based on the audit findings, I would recommend specific changes to improve transparency and accountability in executive compensation and corporate governance practices.

By taking these actions, I would aim to restore trust in the company's leadership and ensure that any financial misconduct is addressed appropriately.
