In this scenario, I would take the following specific action: I would initiate a partnership with a reputable non-governmental organization (NGO) that specializes in ethical sourcing and labor rights, such as Fair Trade or the Responsible Business Alliance. This partnership would focus on establishing a comprehensive program to audit and improve the working conditions in the tin mines supplying Apple.

The steps I would take include:

1. **Identify and Collaborate with an NGO**: Reach out to an NGO that has experience in improving labor conditions in mining sectors, particularly in Indonesia. This organization would help in assessing the current conditions and identifying the mines that are operating unethically.

2. **Conduct Thorough Audits**: Work with the NGO to conduct detailed audits of the tin mines in Indonesia. This would involve on-the-ground assessments to evaluate safety conditions, labor practices, and the presence of child labor.

3. **Develop a Certification Program**: Create a certification program for tin suppliers that meet ethical labor standards. This program would incentivize mines to improve their practices in order to be eligible to supply tin to Apple.

4. **Implement Training Programs**: Fund and implement training programs for miners and mine operators on safe mining practices, workers' rights, and environmental sustainability.

5. **Establish a Traceability System**: Develop a traceability system that allows Apple to track the source of its tin and ensure that it is coming from certified mines. This would involve working with suppliers to ensure transparency in the supply chain.

6. **Public Reporting**: Commit to publicly reporting the progress of these initiatives annually, detailing the improvements made in working conditions and the number of mines certified under the new program.

By taking these concrete steps, Apple would not only address the ethical concerns surrounding its tin sourcing but also contribute to meaningful improvements in the lives of the workers in those mines.
