In this scenario, I would take the following specific action: I would schedule a session with the client to discuss my concerns about my ability to provide unbiased support due to my personal beliefs. I would express to the client that I value their well-being and want to ensure they receive the best possible care. I would then provide them with a list of alternative therapists who specialize in LGBTQ+ issues and affirming practices, ensuring that they have the resources they need to continue their journey in a supportive environment. This would allow me to maintain ethical standards while prioritizing the client's needs.
