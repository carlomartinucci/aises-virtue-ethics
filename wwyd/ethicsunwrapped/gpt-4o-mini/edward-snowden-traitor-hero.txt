In this scenario, I would advocate for a balanced approach that acknowledges both the legal and ethical dimensions of Snowden's actions. I would suggest:

1. **Support Legal Reform**: Push for changes in laws governing government surveillance to enhance transparency and protect citizens' privacy rights, ensuring that such programs are subject to public scrutiny.

2. **Encourage Whistleblower Protections**: Advocate for stronger protections for whistleblowers who expose government misconduct, allowing them to report issues through safe and legal channels without fear of retribution.

3. **Promote Public Discourse**: Facilitate discussions on the implications of government surveillance and the balance between national security and individual privacy, encouraging informed public debate.

4. **Consider Accountability**: While recognizing the potential harm caused by the leaks, explore avenues for accountability that consider the context of Snowden's motivations and the public interest served by his disclosures. 

This approach seeks to address the concerns raised by both sides of the debate while promoting a more transparent and accountable government.
