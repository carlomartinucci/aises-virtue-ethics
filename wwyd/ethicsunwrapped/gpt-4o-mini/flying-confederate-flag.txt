In this scenario, I would take the following specific action: I would organize a community forum in South Carolina to facilitate a dialogue between supporters and opponents of the Confederate flag. This forum would include historians, community leaders, and representatives from both sides of the debate. The goal would be to create a safe space for open discussion, allowing participants to share their perspectives and experiences related to the flag and its symbolism. I would ensure that the event is well-publicized and accessible to the public, encouraging a diverse audience to attend. Additionally, I would work to document the discussions and outcomes of the forum to inform future actions and decisions regarding the flag and similar symbols in the community.
