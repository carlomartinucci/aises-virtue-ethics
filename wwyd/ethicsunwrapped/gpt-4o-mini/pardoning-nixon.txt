In this scenario, if I were President Ford, I would take the following specific action: I would publicly announce my decision to grant Nixon a conditional pardon, stating that it would only apply if he cooperated with a full investigation into the Watergate scandal. This would involve Nixon agreeing to testify before Congress and provide all relevant documents related to his actions while in office. By doing this, I would aim to balance the need for national healing and moving forward with the public's demand for accountability, while also addressing concerns about Nixon's health and the potential for a lengthy legal battle that could further divide the nation.
