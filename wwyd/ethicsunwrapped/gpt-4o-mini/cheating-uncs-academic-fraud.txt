In response to the situation described, I would take the following specific action: I would gather evidence of the academic fraud, including emails, course syllabi (or lack thereof), and testimonies from students and faculty who were aware of the fraudulent classes. I would then compile this information into a detailed report and submit it to the appropriate university authorities, such as the academic integrity office or the university's board of trustees, to ensure that the issue is formally investigated and addressed. This report would include a clear call for accountability and reform in the academic support systems for student-athletes to prevent such practices from occurring in the future.
