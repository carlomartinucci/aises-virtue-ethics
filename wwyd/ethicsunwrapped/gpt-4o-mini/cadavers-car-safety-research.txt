In response to the situation regarding the use of cadavers in crash tests at Heidelberg University, I would take the following specific action: I would organize a public forum or panel discussion that includes ethicists, medical professionals, automotive safety experts, and representatives from advocacy groups. The goal of this forum would be to openly discuss the ethical implications of using human cadavers in research, the potential benefits for automotive safety, and the importance of consent from families. 

I would ensure that the forum is well-publicized and accessible to the public, allowing for community input and engagement. This would provide a platform for diverse perspectives, facilitate a constructive dialogue, and help to address public concerns while exploring alternative research methods that respect human dignity. Additionally, I would advocate for the establishment of stricter ethical guidelines and oversight for future research involving human remains, ensuring that any such studies prioritize consent and ethical considerations.
