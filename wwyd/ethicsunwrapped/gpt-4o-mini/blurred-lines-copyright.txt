In this scenario, if I were Robin Thicke or Pharrell Williams, I would take the following specific action: I would publicly acknowledge Marvin Gaye's influence on "Blurred Lines" and express a willingness to collaborate with the Gaye family to create a tribute project that honors Gaye's legacy. This could involve producing a new song or a remix that incorporates elements of "Got to Give It Up," ensuring that Gaye's contributions to music are recognized and celebrated. Additionally, I would propose a charitable donation to a foundation or cause supported by the Gaye family, demonstrating a commitment to honoring the artistic heritage and fostering goodwill.
