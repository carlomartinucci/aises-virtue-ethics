In this scenario, I would take the following specific action: I would organize a public forum or panel discussion featuring Asian American actors, directors, and cultural critics to address the implications of casting choices in productions like Miss Saigon. This forum would aim to create a space for dialogue about representation in the arts, the impact of casting decisions on Asian American communities, and the importance of racial authenticity in theater. I would invite media coverage to ensure that the conversation reaches a wider audience, encouraging both industry professionals and the public to engage with the issues surrounding representation and diversity in the performing arts.
