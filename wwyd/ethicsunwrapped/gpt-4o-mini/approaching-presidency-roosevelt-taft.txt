In this scenario, I would take the following specific action: I would organize a meeting between Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft to facilitate a discussion about their differing views on presidential power and governance. The goal of this meeting would be to encourage open dialogue and understanding between the two leaders, allowing them to express their perspectives on the stewardship versus strict constructionist models of the presidency. I would prepare an agenda that includes key points of contention, such as the role of the president in regulating trusts and the extent of executive power, and ensure that both sides have equal time to present their arguments. This meeting would aim to find common ground and potentially develop a unified approach to governance that respects both the need for strong leadership and adherence to constitutional limits.
