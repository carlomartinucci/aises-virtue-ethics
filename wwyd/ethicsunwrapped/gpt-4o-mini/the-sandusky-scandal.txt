In this scenario, if I were in the position of Mike McQueary after witnessing Sandusky's actions in the locker room, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Immediately Report to Authorities**: I would go directly to the police and file a formal report detailing what I witnessed. This would include providing a clear account of the incident, including the time, location, and the identities of those involved.

2. **Document Everything**: I would write a detailed account of the incident as soon as possible, including any conversations I had with Paterno, Curley, and Schultz. This documentation would serve as a record of my actions and the information I provided.

3. **Follow Up**: After reporting to the police, I would follow up with them to ensure that they were taking action on my report. I would also seek to confirm that the appropriate child protective services were notified.

4. **Seek Legal Counsel**: I would consult with a lawyer to understand my rights and responsibilities in this situation, ensuring that I was protected while advocating for the victims.

5. **Advocate for Victims**: I would reach out to child advocacy organizations to inform them of the situation and seek their guidance on how to ensure the safety of potential victims.

By taking these actions, I would prioritize the safety and well-being of the children involved, ensuring that the matter was handled by the appropriate authorities rather than being swept under the rug.
