In this scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Conduct a Thorough Review**: I would gather all relevant documentation related to the original research, including the methods, data, and any correspondence between the authors. This would involve reviewing the original *Cell* article, lab notebooks, and any emails or communications regarding the replication attempts.

2. **Engage an Independent Expert**: I would seek out an independent expert in plant cell biology to evaluate the original research and the replication attempts. This expert would assess the validity of the methods used and the results obtained by both Chandok and the subsequent researchers.

3. **Facilitate a Mediation Meeting**: I would arrange a mediation meeting between Klessig, Chandok, and the independent expert to discuss the findings. The goal would be to reach a mutual understanding of the situation and explore potential resolutions, such as a joint statement regarding the retraction and the status of the research.

4. **Draft a Joint Statement**: If the mediation is successful, I would help draft a joint statement that acknowledges the complexities of the situation, clarifies the status of the research, and emphasizes the importance of scientific integrity. This statement would be submitted to the journal *Cell* and other relevant platforms to inform the scientific community.

5. **Implement a Review Process**: I would propose that BTI implement a more robust internal review process for future publications to ensure that all co-authors are in agreement about the findings and that there is a clear protocol for addressing concerns about replicability before any retraction is made.

By taking these actions, I would aim to address the immediate issues stemming from the retraction while also fostering a culture of transparency and collaboration in scientific research.
