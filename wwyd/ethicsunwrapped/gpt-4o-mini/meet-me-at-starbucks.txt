In response to the incident at Starbucks, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Organize a Community Forum**: I would coordinate a community forum at the local Starbucks location where the incident occurred. This forum would invite local leaders, community members, and representatives from Starbucks to discuss the incident, its implications, and how to foster a more inclusive environment in the store.

2. **Invite Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson**: I would reach out to Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson to invite them to share their experiences and perspectives during the forum. Their firsthand accounts would provide valuable insights into the impact of the incident and the importance of addressing racial bias.

3. **Develop Actionable Steps**: During the forum, I would facilitate a discussion to develop actionable steps that both Starbucks and the community can take to prevent similar incidents in the future. This could include suggestions for ongoing training for employees, community engagement initiatives, and partnerships with local organizations focused on racial equity.

4. **Follow Up with Starbucks**: After the forum, I would follow up with Starbucks management to ensure that they are implementing the suggestions made during the discussion and to encourage them to maintain an open line of communication with the community regarding their progress.

5. **Promote Awareness**: I would use social media and local news outlets to promote the forum and raise awareness about the importance of addressing racial bias in public spaces, encouraging others to engage in similar discussions in their communities. 

By taking these concrete actions, I would aim to create a constructive dialogue around the incident and work towards meaningful change in the community and within Starbucks.
