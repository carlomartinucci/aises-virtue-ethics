In response to the challenges presented by the Paris Agreement and the ethical dilemmas surrounding climate change, I would take the following specific action: 

I would organize a series of workshops and forums in my local community aimed at raising awareness about climate change and its impacts, particularly focusing on the intergenerational and global aspects of the issue. These workshops would include presentations from climate scientists, local environmental activists, and representatives from developing countries who can share their experiences and challenges related to climate change. 

The goal of these workshops would be to educate community members about the importance of reducing carbon emissions and to discuss practical steps that individuals and local businesses can take to contribute to this effort. I would also facilitate discussions on how our local actions can align with the broader goals of the Paris Agreement, emphasizing the need for collective action and the ethical responsibility we have to future generations. 

Additionally, I would encourage participants to engage with local policymakers, advocating for stronger climate policies and support for sustainable practices within our community. This would include promoting initiatives such as renewable energy projects, community gardens, and public transportation improvements to reduce our carbon footprint. 

By fostering a sense of community responsibility and action, I aim to create a grassroots movement that not only addresses local climate issues but also contributes to the global effort to combat climate change.
