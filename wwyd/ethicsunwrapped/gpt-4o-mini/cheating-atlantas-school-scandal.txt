In this scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Document Everything**: I would keep detailed records of all communications and directives from Principal Waller regarding changing test answers. This would include dates, times, and the exact wording of any requests made.

2. **Seek Support from Colleagues**: I would discuss my concerns with trusted colleagues to gauge their feelings about the situation and see if they share my apprehensions about the ethical implications of changing test answers.

3. **Approach the Principal**: I would request a private meeting with Principal Waller to express my concerns about the integrity of the testing process and the potential long-term consequences for our students if the truth were to come out.

4. **Contact Higher Authorities**: If my concerns are dismissed, I would consider reaching out to the school district's ethics office or a whistleblower hotline to report the pressure to change test answers, ensuring that I provide the documentation I have collected.

5. **Focus on Student Support**: While navigating this situation, I would continue to provide my students with the best possible education and support, emphasizing learning and understanding over test scores, to help them succeed genuinely.

6. **Prepare for Consequences**: I would mentally and professionally prepare for potential backlash or repercussions from my actions, including the possibility of losing my job, but prioritize the ethical implications of my choices for the sake of my students' futures.
