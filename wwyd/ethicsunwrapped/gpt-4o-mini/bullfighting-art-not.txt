In this scenario, I would organize a community forum in a town where bullfighting is still practiced. The forum would invite both proponents and opponents of bullfighting to share their perspectives. I would ensure that the event is moderated to allow for respectful dialogue, and I would provide a platform for animal rights activists to present their views alongside cultural advocates of bullfighting. 

Additionally, I would invite a veterinarian or animal welfare expert to discuss the welfare of bulls in both bullfighting and traditional farming practices. The goal would be to foster understanding and explore potential compromises, such as the continuation of bullfighting without the killing of the bull, while also addressing the concerns of animal rights activists. 

I would promote the event through local media and social media channels to ensure a diverse audience, and I would document the discussions to share with the wider community afterward, encouraging ongoing dialogue about the cultural significance and ethical implications of bullfighting.
