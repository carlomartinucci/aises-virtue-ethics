In this scenario, if I were in Nick Leeson's position and had just realized the extent of the losses I had hidden, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Immediate Disclosure**: I would immediately inform my direct supervisor and the compliance department at Barings Bank about the hidden losses. I would provide a full account of the situation, including the amounts lost and the methods used to conceal the losses.

2. **Cease Trading**: I would stop all trading activities immediately to prevent further losses and to stabilize the situation.

3. **Seek Guidance**: I would request a meeting with senior management to discuss the situation transparently and seek their guidance on how to address the financial crisis I had created.

4. **Prepare Documentation**: I would compile all relevant documentation regarding the trades, losses, and the error account to present a clear and honest picture of the situation to management and auditors.

5. **Cooperate with Investigations**: I would fully cooperate with any internal or external investigations that followed, providing all necessary information to help understand the situation and prevent future occurrences.

By taking these actions, I would aim to mitigate the damage to the bank and take responsibility for my actions, rather than allowing the situation to escalate further.
