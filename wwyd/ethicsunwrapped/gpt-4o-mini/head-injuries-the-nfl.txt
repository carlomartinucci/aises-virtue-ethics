In this scenario, I would take the specific action of advocating for increased transparency and education regarding the risks of brain injuries in football, particularly at the NFL level. This would involve:

1. **Organizing a Public Awareness Campaign**: I would collaborate with health professionals, former players, and advocacy groups to create a campaign that educates fans, players, and parents about the potential risks of concussions and CTE associated with football. This campaign would include informational materials, social media outreach, and community events.

2. **Engaging with the NFL**: I would reach out to NFL officials to propose the implementation of mandatory educational sessions for players, coaches, and staff about the long-term effects of head injuries. This would ensure that everyone involved in the sport is fully aware of the risks and the importance of reporting injuries.

3. **Promoting Research Funding**: I would advocate for the NFL to allocate a portion of its revenue towards independent research on brain injuries in football, ensuring that the findings are made public and not influenced by the league's interests.

4. **Encouraging Safer Playing Practices**: I would work with youth and high school football leagues to promote safer playing techniques and the use of advanced protective equipment, emphasizing the importance of safety over competitiveness.

5. **Creating Support Networks**: I would help establish support networks for former players who may be experiencing cognitive issues, providing them with resources and access to medical professionals who specialize in brain health.

By taking these concrete steps, I would aim to foster a culture of safety and awareness around the risks of football, while still respecting the sport's traditions and the enjoyment it brings to many.
