In this situation, I would take the following specific action: After Robert leaves, I would approach Mary and express my concern about the conversation. I would say, "Mary, I noticed that when Robert mentioned helping 'hard-working Americans,' he seemed to misunderstand that our clients are primarily immigrants. I think it's important for us to clarify that our mission supports immigrants who are seeking shelter and assistance. If we don't correct this misunderstanding, we might miss out on future support from donors who could help us further our mission." This way, I would ensure that Mary is aware of the potential implications of not addressing Robert's misconceptions and encourage her to be more transparent in future discussions with donors.
