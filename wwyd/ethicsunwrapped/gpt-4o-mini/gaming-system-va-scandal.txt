In this scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Report the Practices**: I would document the specific instances of unethical practices I observed, including the manipulation of wait times and the use of two sets of records. I would gather evidence, such as emails and any relevant data, to support my claims.

2. **Contact the Appropriate Authorities**: I would report these findings to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the Department of Veterans Affairs. This would involve submitting a formal complaint detailing the unethical practices and providing the evidence I collected.

3. **Engage with Whistleblower Protections**: I would ensure that I understand and utilize the whistleblower protections available to me as an employee of the VA. This would involve consulting with a legal advisor or a whistleblower advocacy group to ensure my rights are protected when I report these issues.

4. **Advocate for Systemic Change**: I would seek to engage with colleagues who share my concerns and advocate for a review of the incentive structures in place. This could involve organizing a meeting with management to discuss the negative impacts of the current system on veterans' care and proposing alternative methods for measuring performance that prioritize patient care over financial bonuses.

5. **Follow Up on the Investigation**: After reporting the practices, I would stay informed about the progress of the investigation by the OIG and any subsequent actions taken by the VA. I would also be prepared to provide further information or testimony if required.

By taking these actions, I would aim to address the unethical practices directly and contribute to improving the care provided to veterans.
