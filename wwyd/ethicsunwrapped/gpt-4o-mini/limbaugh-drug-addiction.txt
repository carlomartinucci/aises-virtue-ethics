In response to the situation involving Rush Limbaugh's illegal drug use and subsequent treatment, I would take the following specific action: I would write a detailed opinion piece for a reputable news outlet that critically examines the disparity between Limbaugh's public stance on drug use and the reality of his personal actions. 

In this piece, I would outline the implications of his statements on drug policy, particularly how they contribute to the stigma surrounding addiction as a disease rather than a moral failing. I would include statistics on addiction, highlight the importance of treatment over punishment, and advocate for a more compassionate approach to drug-related issues. Additionally, I would call for a reevaluation of drug laws that disproportionately affect individuals struggling with addiction, emphasizing the need for systemic change in how society addresses drug use and addiction. 

This action aims to foster a public dialogue about the complexities of addiction and the need for a more humane and effective approach to drug policy.
