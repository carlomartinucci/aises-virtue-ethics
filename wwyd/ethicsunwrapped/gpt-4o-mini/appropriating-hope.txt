In this scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Conduct a thorough review of the original photograph**: I would analyze Mannie Garcia's original photo to understand its composition, context, and the elements that make it unique. This would help in assessing how much of the original work is retained in the new artwork.

2. **Document the transformation process**: I would keep detailed records of how the original image was altered in the creation of the new artwork. This would include sketches, notes on the artistic choices made, and explanations of how the new work conveys a different message or meaning.

3. **Seek legal advice**: I would consult with an intellectual property attorney who specializes in copyright and fair use to evaluate the legal standing of the new artwork. This would help clarify the boundaries of fair use in this specific case.

4. **Engage in dialogue with the original photographer**: I would reach out to Mannie Garcia to discuss the use of his photograph, acknowledging his rights and seeking his perspective on the transformation. This could foster a collaborative relationship and potentially lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.

5. **Consider a licensing agreement**: If the legal advice suggests that the use of the photograph could be problematic, I would explore the possibility of negotiating a licensing agreement with The A.P. or Mannie Garcia to use the original image legally while still creating the new artwork.

6. **Publicly acknowledge the original work**: In any promotional materials or exhibitions featuring the new artwork, I would ensure that Mannie Garcia and The A.P. are credited appropriately, recognizing their contributions and rights.

7. **Monitor the impact of the artwork**: After the release of the new piece, I would observe public and critical responses to gauge the effectiveness of the transformation and its reception in the context of the original work. This feedback could inform future projects and appropriations.
