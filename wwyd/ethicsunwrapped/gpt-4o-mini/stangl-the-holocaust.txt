In this scenario, if I were in a position to influence the situation during Stangl's trial, I would focus on ensuring that the testimonies of survivors and witnesses to the atrocities committed at Treblinka and other camps were given significant weight in the proceedings. Specifically, I would organize a series of testimonies from Holocaust survivors and former inmates who could provide firsthand accounts of the horrors they experienced under Stangl's command. I would work with legal teams to prepare these witnesses, ensuring they felt safe and supported while sharing their stories in court. This would aim to counter Stangl's claims of being merely an administrator and to highlight the human impact of his actions, reinforcing the moral responsibility he bore for the atrocities committed.
