In this scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Engage in a Dialogue with the Patient**: I would initiate a conversation with the patient, even if he is deemed incompetent, to understand his fears and concerns about medication. This would involve using simple language and a calm demeanor to help him express his thoughts about the new medication and his paranoia regarding being poisoned.

2. **Consult with a Psychiatrist**: I would seek the opinion of a psychiatrist to evaluate the patient's current mental state and assess whether there is any possibility of improving his competency to make decisions about his treatment. This could involve a formal assessment to determine if he can understand the risks and benefits of the new medication.

3. **Explore Alternative Administration Methods**: If the patient remains paranoid about taking the medication in pill form, I would work with the medical team to explore alternative methods of administration that do not involve deception, such as liquid formulations or other delivery methods that might be more acceptable to the patient.

4. **Involve an Ethics Committee**: I would bring the case to the hospital's ethics committee to discuss the ethical implications of administering medication without the patient's knowledge. This would provide a platform for a broader discussion about the ethical principles at stake, including autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence.

5. **Document Everything**: I would ensure that all discussions, decisions, and rationales are thoroughly documented in the patient's medical record, including the patient's expressed fears, the rationale for considering the new medication, and the input from the ethics committee.

By taking these actions, I would aim to respect the patient's autonomy as much as possible while also considering the best interests of his health and safety.
