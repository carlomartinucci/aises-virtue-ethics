In this scenario, if I were a member of Reserve Police Battalion 101 in July 1942, I would take the specific action of publicly refusing to participate in the mass shooting of civilians during the meeting where the commander offers the choice. I would stand up and clearly state my refusal to take part in the killings, emphasizing my moral objection to the orders being given. By doing this, I would not only opt out for myself but also aim to encourage others who might be feeling the same internal conflict to reconsider their participation. This act of refusal would be a direct challenge to the pressure for conformity and could potentially inspire a small number of my comrades to also step back from the task.
