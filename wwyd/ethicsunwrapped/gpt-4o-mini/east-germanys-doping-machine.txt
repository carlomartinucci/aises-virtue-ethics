In this scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Document Everything**: I would keep a detailed journal of my experiences, including the names of coaches, doctors, and any conversations regarding the doping practices. This documentation would serve as evidence of the unethical practices occurring within the GDR sports system.

2. **Seek Support from Other Athletes**: I would reach out to fellow athletes who might share my concerns about the doping program. I would organize a small, discreet group to discuss our experiences and feelings about the situation, ensuring that we could support each other in resisting the pressure to dope.

3. **Report to Authorities**: I would gather the documented evidence and, if possible, anonymously report the doping practices to international sports authorities or journalists who could investigate the situation further. This could involve sending my journal and any other evidence to organizations like the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or reputable news outlets.

4. **Refuse to Participate**: I would firmly refuse to take any performance-enhancing drugs, regardless of the consequences. I would communicate my decision to my coaches and the STASI if necessary, making it clear that I would not compromise my health or integrity for the sake of competition.

5. **Consider Defection**: If the situation became untenable and my safety was at risk, I would explore options for defection to the West, seeking asylum where I could speak freely about the doping practices and advocate for the rights of athletes.

By taking these actions, I would aim to resist the unethical practices of the GDR sports system while also protecting my own health and integrity.
