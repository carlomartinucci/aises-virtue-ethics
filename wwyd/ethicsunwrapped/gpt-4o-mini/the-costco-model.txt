In this scenario, if I were a manager at Costco, I would implement a specific initiative to enhance employee engagement and productivity by launching a quarterly employee feedback program. This program would involve the following concrete actions:

1. **Design a Feedback Survey**: Create a comprehensive survey that includes questions about employee satisfaction, suggestions for improvements, and areas where they feel they need more support or resources.

2. **Schedule Regular Feedback Sessions**: Organize quarterly meetings where employees can discuss their feedback in person. This would allow for open dialogue and ensure that employees feel heard.

3. **Analyze Feedback**: After each survey, I would analyze the results to identify common themes and areas for improvement. This analysis would be shared with all employees to maintain transparency.

4. **Implement Changes Based on Feedback**: Based on the feedback received, I would work with the management team to implement at least one significant change each quarter that addresses employee concerns or suggestions.

5. **Recognize Contributions**: Establish a recognition program that highlights employees who provide valuable feedback or contribute to positive changes in the workplace.

By taking these specific actions, I would aim to foster a culture of open communication and continuous improvement, which aligns with Costco's commitment to employee satisfaction and ethical practices.
