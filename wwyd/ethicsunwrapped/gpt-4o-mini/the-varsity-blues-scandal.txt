In this scenario, if I were a parent approached by Rick Singer with his "side door" method, I would take the following specific action: I would refuse to engage with Singer's services and report him to the authorities. 

I would document any communications I had with him, including emails or messages, and provide this information to the FBI or the appropriate law enforcement agency. Additionally, I would inform my child about the situation, emphasizing the importance of integrity and the value of earning admission through hard work and merit. I would also seek to support my child in their college application process through legitimate means, such as helping them improve their academic performance and encouraging them to participate in extracurricular activities that genuinely interest them.
