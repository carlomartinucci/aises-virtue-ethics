In response to the unethical practices at Wells Fargo, I would take the following specific action: I would gather evidence of the fraudulent activities and document my experiences as an employee, including any instances of pressure to create unauthorized accounts or mistreatment of whistleblowers. I would then report this information to the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to ensure that the misconduct is investigated thoroughly. Additionally, I would seek legal counsel to understand my rights as a whistleblower and to protect myself from potential retaliation while pursuing this course of action.
