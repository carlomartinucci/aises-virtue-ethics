Given the situation involving the football program at Baylor University under the leadership of Coach Art Briles, I would immediately take the following concrete steps:

1. Gather all available evidence, documents, emails, and text messages regarding the allegations of sexual assault, dating violence, and misconduct involving football players at Baylor University during Art Briles' tenure.

2. Conduct a thorough and independent investigation into the specific actions taken by Coach Briles, the coaching staff, and athletic department personnel in response to reports of sexual assault and misconduct. 

3. Consult with legal experts to ensure that proper procedures and protocols were followed in handling such sensitive cases, particularly in adherence to Title IX regulations and other relevant laws.

4. Offer support and resources to the victims and survivors of sexual assault or violence, ensuring their well-being and addressing their needs and concerns as a top priority.

5. Implement new policies and training programs to educate all staff, coaches, and students on reporting procedures, Title IX compliance, and creating a safe and inclusive environment for all members of the university community.

6. Cooperate fully with any ongoing investigations, legal proceedings, or inquiries from relevant authorities to ensure transparency and accountability in addressing the systemic issues within the football program.

7. Communicate openly and honestly with the university community, stakeholders, and the public about the steps being taken to address the failures and cultural issues within the football program at Baylor University during Coach Briles' tenure. This would include acknowledging past mistakes, outlining the corrective measures being implemented, and emphasizing a commitment to preventing such incidents in the future.
