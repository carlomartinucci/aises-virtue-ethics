In this scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Report all known cases of sexual assault or misconduct involving football players to the appropriate university authorities, such as the Title IX coordinator and university officials responsible for handling such cases.
   
2. Cooperate fully with any investigations initiated by the university or any external agencies regarding the reported cases.

3. Implement strict policies and procedures within the football program to ensure that any reports of sexual assault or misconduct are handled promptly, fairly, and in accordance with the law and university policies.

4. Provide support and resources for victims of sexual assault within the football program, including counseling services and assistance in navigating the reporting and investigative processes.

5. Evaluate the conduct of all football coaches and staff involved in covering up or mishandling reports of sexual assault, and take appropriate disciplinary action, which may include termination of employment.

6. Work closely with university leadership to rectify any systemic issues within the football program that contributed to the mishandling of sexual assault cases, and take steps to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future.

By taking these specific actions, I aim to address the immediate concerns related to the mishandling of sexual assault cases within the football program at Baylor University, uphold ethical standards in reporting and handling such cases, and work towards preventing similar incidents from happening in the future.
