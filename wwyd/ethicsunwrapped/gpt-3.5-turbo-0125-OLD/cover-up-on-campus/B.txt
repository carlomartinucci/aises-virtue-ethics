I would have taken decisive action as soon as reports of sexual assault and misconduct involving Baylor football players started emerging. I would have immediately reported any allegations to the appropriate university officials, such as the Title IX coordinator, to ensure thorough investigations and proper actions were taken. I would prioritize the safety and well-being of all students, particularly survivors of assault, by providing necessary support and resources. Additionally, I would have implemented clear policies and procedures to prevent future incidents, such as ensuring that all reports of misconduct were handled transparently and in accordance with the law. Lastly, I would hold all individuals accountable for their actions, regardless of their status within the football program or university, to demonstrate a commitment to justice and integrity.
