I would acknowledge the seriousness of the situation and take immediate action by cooperating fully with the investigation conducted by Pepper Hamilton. I would ensure full transparency in providing all necessary information and evidence to the investigators to help uncover the extent of the issue. Additionally, I would proactively review and reassess all existing policies and procedures related to Title IX compliance and reporting of sexual assault cases within the athletic program. I would also work closely with university officials to implement stricter oversight mechanisms to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Furthermore, I would prioritize the well-being and safety of all students and ensure that proper support and resources are provided to victims of sexual assault within the Baylor community.
