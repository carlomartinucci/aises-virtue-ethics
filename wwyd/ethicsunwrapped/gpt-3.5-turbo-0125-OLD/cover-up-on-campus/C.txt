I would ethically condemn the actions of Art Briles, as he was aware of multiple reports of sexual assaults involving his football players and yet failed to take appropriate action by not reporting these incidents to the university authorities as required by Title IX regulations. Additionally, I would acknowledge the severe impact that Briles' lack of action had on the victims who felt discouraged from speaking up due to the lack of response and accountability from the football program.

In response to these egregious failings, I would work to ensure that similar incidents are prevented in the future by prioritizing the safety and well-being of all individuals within the university community. This would involve implementing clear policies and procedures for reporting and handling cases of sexual assault, providing training for staff and coaches on their responsibilities under Title IX, and fostering a culture of accountability and transparency within the athletics department.

Furthermore, I would advocate for a thorough review of the university's athletics programs to identify and address any systemic issues that may have contributed to the mishandling of sexual assault cases. It is crucial that all members of the university community are held to the highest standards of integrity and ethical conduct, and that appropriate measures are taken to ensure the safety and protection of all individuals on campus.
