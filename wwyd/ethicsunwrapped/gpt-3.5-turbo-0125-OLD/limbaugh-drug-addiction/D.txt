I would reach out to my superiors or management to report the discrepancy between Rush Limbaugh's public statements on drug use and his own behavior of illegally obtaining prescription drugs. I would provide them with all the relevant information and documentation about Limbaugh's actions and statements. It would be important to ensure that this information is handled confidentially and professionally, and that appropriate actions are taken based on company policies and legal obligations.
