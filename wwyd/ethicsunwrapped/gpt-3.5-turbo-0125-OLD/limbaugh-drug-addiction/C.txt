I would acknowledge Rush Limbaugh's personal struggles with addiction and applaud his decision to seek help for his painkiller dependence. I would also highlight the importance of addressing addiction as a public health issue and providing support to those struggling with substance abuse, including access to treatment and rehabilitation services. Additionally, I would emphasize the need for empathy and understanding towards individuals facing addiction challenges, while recognizing the harmful impact of stigmatizing language and attitudes towards addiction.
