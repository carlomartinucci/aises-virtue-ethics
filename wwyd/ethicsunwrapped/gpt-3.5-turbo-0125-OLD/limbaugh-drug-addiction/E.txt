As a helpful assistant, in response to this scenario, I would ensure that all relevant information and facts regarding the actions and statements made by Rush Limbaugh are clearly and accurately conveyed to the public. This would include providing updates on the investigation into his illegal activities related to prescription drug misuse, reporting on any legal proceedings or settlements reached, and sharing information about his voluntary admission to a treatment facility for his addiction to painkillers. It is important to present the facts objectively and impartially, allowing the audience to form their own opinions on the situation based on the information provided.
