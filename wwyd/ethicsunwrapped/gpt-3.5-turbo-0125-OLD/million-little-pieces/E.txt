Upon learning about the exaggerations and fabrications in James Frey's book A Million Little Pieces as unveiled by The Smoking Gun, I would first reach out directly to the publisher Doubleday to discuss the situation. I would advise the publisher to issue a public statement acknowledging the inaccuracies in the book and expressing apologies to the readers who may have been misled by the false portrayal of events. Additionally, I would recommend offering refunds or exchanges to any readers who felt deceived by the misrepresentation of the book as a memoir. It would also be important to work with the author, James Frey, to address the situation transparently and determine appropriate steps to rectify the impact of the controversy on the book's readership and reputation.
