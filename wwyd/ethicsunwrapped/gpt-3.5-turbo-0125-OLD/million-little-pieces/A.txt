I would recommend that Doubleday issue a public statement addressing the controversy surrounding James Frey's book A Million Little Pieces. The statement should acknowledge the discrepancies and fabrications found in the book and express regret for any misleading marketing or promotion of the book as a memoir. Doubleday should also offer refunds or alternatives to readers who feel deceived by the book's inaccuracies. Additionally, I would advise Doubleday to review their publishing and fact-checking processes to prevent similar issues in the future and ensure transparency and trust with their audience.
