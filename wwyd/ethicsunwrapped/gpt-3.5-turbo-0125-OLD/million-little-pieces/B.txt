If I were in this situation, I would advise James Frey to publicly acknowledge and take responsibility for the inaccuracies in his book A Million Little Pieces. I would recommend that he issues a sincere apology to both Oprah Winfrey and to his readers for misleading them. Additionally, I would encourage him to clarify the distinction between memoir and fiction, emphasizing the importance of honesty and transparency when presenting personal stories to the public. Furthermore, I would suggest that Frey works with his publisher to update future editions of the book with a note detailing the discrepancies found in his account.
