I would take the action of acknowledging the discrepancies and fabrications in James Frey's book publicly. This would involve issuing a statement or press release addressing the issues raised by The Smoking Gun and expressing regret for any misleading information presented in the book. Additionally, I would work with my team to offer refunds or exchanges to readers who may have purchased the book under false pretenses, in order to uphold transparency and honesty in our dealings with customers.
