If faced with a similar situation, I would inform all relevant stakeholders, including the publisher, author, and Oprah’s team, about the inaccuracies and fabrications found in the book. I would recommend conducting a thorough investigation into the claims made by The Smoking Gun to determine the extent of the inaccuracies and assess the potential impact on the readers and the author’s credibility. I would also suggest issuing a formal apology to the readers and the public for any misleading information presented in the book. Additionally, I would explore the possibility of offering refunds or exchanges for readers who may have purchased the book under false pretenses. Lastly, I would work to develop and implement stricter fact-checking and verification processes for memoirs and similar works to prevent similar controversies in the future.
