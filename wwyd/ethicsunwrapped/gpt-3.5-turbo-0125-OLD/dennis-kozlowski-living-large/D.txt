I would thoroughly investigate the evidence presented during the trial of Dennis Kozlowski to understand the basis for the charges against him. This investigation would involve reviewing financial records, documents, and any other relevant materials related to the unauthorized bonuses and other financial misconduct that led to his conviction. I would assess the legality and authorization of the bonuses in question to determine if there were any discrepancies or misinterpretations that could potentially suggest a lack of criminal intent on Kozlowski's part. Additionally, I would analyze the information obtained from the company's books and records to verify the accuracy of the prosecution's claims and evaluate Kozlowski's defense of transparency and lack of hidden information.
