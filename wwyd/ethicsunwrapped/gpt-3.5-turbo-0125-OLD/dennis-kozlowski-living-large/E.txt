I would ensure that all financial transactions and perks given to executives, including the CEO, are properly documented, authorized, and disclosed in accordance with company policies and regulatory requirements. I would establish a robust internal control system to monitor corporate expenditures and prevent unauthorized bonuses or expenses. Additionally, I would regularly review executive compensation and perks to ensure they align with industry standards and are approved by the board of directors to avoid potential conflicts of interest. In cases of doubt or ambiguity, I would seek legal counsel to ensure compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.
