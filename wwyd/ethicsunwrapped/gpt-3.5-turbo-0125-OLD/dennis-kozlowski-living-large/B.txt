I would ensure a thorough investigation into the financial records of Tyco International during Dennis Kozlowski's tenure as CEO to determine the accuracy of his claims that all transactions were properly documented and accounted for. This investigation would involve reviewing the company's financial statements, expense reports, authorization records, and other relevant documents to assess if there was any wrongdoing in the handling of funds and if Kozlowski's actions were indeed authorized.
