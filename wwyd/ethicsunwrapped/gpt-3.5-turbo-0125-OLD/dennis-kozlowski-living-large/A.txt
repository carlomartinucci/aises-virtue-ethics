I would conduct a thorough investigation into the financial transactions and records of Tyco International during Dennis Kozlowski's tenure as CEO. This investigation would aim to verify the authenticity of Kozlowski's claims regarding the lack of criminal intent and transparency in the company's financial activities. I would examine the documentation provided by both the prosecution and the defense to determine the accuracy of the financial records and to assess whether the bonuses and other expenses were indeed unauthorized. Additionally, I would analyze the company's governance structure and policies to understand the processes in place for authorizing executive compensation and expenses. This detailed review would help clarify the extent of Kozlowski's involvement in any financial misconduct and provide a more accurate assessment of the situation.
