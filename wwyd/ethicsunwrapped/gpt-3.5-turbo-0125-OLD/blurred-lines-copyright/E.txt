I would suggest that individuals who are in the creative industry, such as musicians, songwriters, and producers, make sure to be thoughtful and deliberate in acknowledging and respecting the works that inspire their own creations. This may involve conducting proper research into the history of the art form, understanding the impact of previous works, and being transparent about influences during the creative process. By doing so, artists not only pay homage to those who have come before them but also help to preserve and foster a culture of innovation and creativity in the industry.
