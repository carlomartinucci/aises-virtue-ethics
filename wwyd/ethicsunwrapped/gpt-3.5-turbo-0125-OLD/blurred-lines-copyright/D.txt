I would recommend that in situations where an artist is influenced by another artist's work, it is crucial to ensure that the extent of the influence does not cross the line into copyright infringement. To avoid potential legal issues, it is advisable to seek permission or licenses for any samples or references used in the creation process. Additionally, maintaining clear records of the creative process, including documenting sources of inspiration and contributions from each collaborator, can help prevent misunderstandings or contradictions in the future. Professional legal advice should be sought to ensure compliance with copyright laws and to address any disputes that may arise.
