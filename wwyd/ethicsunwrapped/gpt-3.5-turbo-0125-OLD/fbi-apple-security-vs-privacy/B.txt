If I were in this scenario, I would have followed my organization's policies and legal obligations to comply with the court order compelling Apple to aid the FBI in unlocking the device. I would have collaborated with the necessary teams within the organization to ensure that all necessary steps were taken to adhere to the court order while also considering any potential implications for user privacy and security. Additionally, I would have worked towards a solution that balanced national security interests with safeguarding individual privacy to the best of my ability within the confines of the legal system.
