In this scenario, I would have initially complied with the court order compelling Apple to assist the FBI in unlocking the iPhone. Apple has a responsibility to cooperate with lawful requests from government authorities in the interest of national security and public safety. By providing assistance in this specific case, Apple would have helped in potentially preventing future terrorist attacks and bringing perpetrators to justice. While there are valid concerns about privacy and setting dangerous precedents, in this particular situation where the FBI was investigating a serious terrorist attack, the immediate security concerns should take precedence.
