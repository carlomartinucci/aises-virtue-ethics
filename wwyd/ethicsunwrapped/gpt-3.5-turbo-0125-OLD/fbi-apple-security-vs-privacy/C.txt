I would have advised Apple's CEO, Timothy Cook, to comply with the court order compelling them to assist the FBI in unlocking the iPhone. This decision would have balanced the interests of national security and individual privacy by allowing law enforcement to access crucial information related to a terrorist attack while also respecting legal procedures and court orders. By cooperating with the FBI, Apple could have demonstrated its commitment to supporting lawful investigations and upholding public safety, which are essential responsibilities in the tech industry. It would have avoided the criticisms and accusations of putting brand image over national security and being unpatriotic.
