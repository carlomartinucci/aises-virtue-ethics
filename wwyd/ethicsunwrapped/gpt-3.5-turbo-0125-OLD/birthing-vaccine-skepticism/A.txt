I would report Andrew Wakefield's actions to the appropriate authorities, including the General Medical Council and any relevant medical licensing boards in the jurisdictions where Wakefield practiced. I would ensure that all relevant information, such as his conflicts of interest, unethical research practices, and misleading publication in The Lancet, is detailed in the report. This is essential to hold Wakefield accountable for his fraudulent behavior and prevent further harm to public health.
