I would take the following specific actions in this scenario:

1. Report Wakefield's unethical behavior and conflicts of interest to the appropriate medical and academic authorities, including the General Medical Council and the university where he was employed.
  
2. Cooperate with investigations into Wakefield's actions and research, providing any relevant information or evidence that may help uncover the extent of his misconduct.

3. Advocate for transparency and accountability in scientific research by promoting the importance of disclosing conflicts of interest and adhering to ethical standards in publications and public statements.

4. Work towards correcting misinformation spread by Wakefield by engaging in public education campaigns that emphasize the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, including the MMR vaccine. 

5. Support efforts to counter vaccine hesitancy and promote evidence-based vaccination practices to protect public health and prevent the spread of preventable diseases.
