I would immediately report Andrew Wakefield's unethical behavior to the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the General Medical Council or other relevant medical licensing boards. I would provide all available evidence detailing Wakefield's conflicts of interest, manipulation of research data, failure to disclose funding sources, and unethical conduct in recruiting study subjects. Additionally, I would ensure that all relevant parties, such as medical journals and institutions involved, are made aware of the misconduct to prevent further dissemination of false research findings. Lastly, I would support any investigations or actions taken by regulatory bodies to hold Wakefield accountable for his actions and prevent further harm to public health.
