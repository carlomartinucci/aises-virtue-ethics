I would contact relevant medical authorities and ethics committees to report Andrew Wakefield's unethical and fraudulent practices in conducting and reporting his research. I would provide all available documentation and evidence to support the report, including details about Wakefield's undisclosed conflicts of interest, manipulation of data, exploitation of vulnerable subjects, and failure to follow proper ethical procedures. I would ensure that Wakefield faces consequences for his actions and that steps are taken to prevent similar misconduct in the future.
