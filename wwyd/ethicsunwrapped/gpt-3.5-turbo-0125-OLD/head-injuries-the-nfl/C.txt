Given the complexity and uncertainty surrounding the issue of brain injuries in football, my specific action would be to advocate for further research and scientific studies in the field of sports-related concussions. I would work towards increasing funding for research that aims to better understand the long-term effects of football on players' brain health, including identifying risk factors, developing diagnostic tools, and exploring potential treatment options for concussions and related conditions such as CTE. Additionally, I would encourage collaboration between medical professionals, researchers, and sports organizations like the NFL to ensure that the most up-to-date and reliable information is being used to inform decisions about player safety and rule changes in the sport. By promoting evidence-based approaches to addressing the issue, we can strive to make football a safer and more sustainable sport for athletes at all levels.
