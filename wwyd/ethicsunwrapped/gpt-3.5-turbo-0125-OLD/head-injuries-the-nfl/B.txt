I would take the following specific actions to address the concerns raised by the potentially harmful effects of playing football at the NFL level:

1. Advocate for ongoing research: Support and encourage continued funding and research into the effects of concussions and head impacts on NFL players' long-term brain health. This includes advocating for more extensive studies, greater transparency, and collaboration among researchers to establish a better understanding of the risks involved.

2. Support improved player safety measures: Promote the adoption and implementation of advanced player safety protocols, such as enhanced helmet technology, improved tackling techniques, and stricter enforcement of rules to reduce head injuries during games. This could involve collaborating with the NFL, medical professionals, and equipment manufacturers to develop and implement effective safety measures.

3. Educate players and coaches: Develop comprehensive educational programs for NFL players and coaches to raise awareness about the risks of head injuries and the importance of reporting concussions promptly. This could include mandatory training sessions, workshops, and informational resources to help players and coaches make informed decisions concerning player safety.

4. Advocate for player welfare: Push for policies that prioritize player welfare and address concerns related to long-term brain health issues. This could include advocating for improved post-career support, mental health services, and long-term healthcare coverage for retired NFL players as part of the overall player wellness program.

5. Monitor and evaluate progress: Establish a system for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of implemented safety measures and research findings in reducing the incidence of concussions and long-term brain injuries among NFL players. This could involve periodic assessments, data analysis, and feedback mechanisms to gauge the impact of initiatives and identify areas for further improvement.
