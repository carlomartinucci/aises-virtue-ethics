In response to the situation surrounding the ethical concerns related to football and brain injuries, I would take the following specific action:

I would advocate for continued and increased funding for research into sports-related concussions (SRCs) and their long-term effects on brain health. This would involve reaching out to NFL officials, medical experts, and scientific researchers to emphasize the importance of funding studies that can provide clearer insights into the risks associated with playing football, specifically in relation to concussions and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). By supporting and promoting further research efforts in this area, we can strive to better understand the complexities of brain injuries in football and work towards developing effective preventive measures to safeguard players' long-term health.
