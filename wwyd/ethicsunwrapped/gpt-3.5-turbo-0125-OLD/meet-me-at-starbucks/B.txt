I would contact the Starbucks location in Philadelphia where the incident occurred and speak with the store manager to gather more information about what happened that led to the arrest of the two men. I would also reach out to Rashon Nelson, Donte Robinson, and Andrew Yaffe to offer my support and apologize on behalf of Starbucks for the treatment they experienced. Furthermore, I would work with the local community leaders to organize a meeting or event where Starbucks executives, including CEO Kevin Johnson, can listen to the concerns of the community and discuss steps to address racial bias within the company.
