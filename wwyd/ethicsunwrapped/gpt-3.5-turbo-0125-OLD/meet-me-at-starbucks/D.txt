I would organize and facilitate the racial-bias education training sessions for all company-owned Starbucks locations in the nation on May 29, 2018. This would involve working with experts in diversity and inclusion to develop the curriculum, coordinating with each store manager to ensure all employees attend the training, and overseeing the implementation of the education program to address implicit bias and discrimination. Furthermore, I would follow up with store managers to track progress and assess the impact of the training on creating a safe and welcoming environment for all customers.
