I would work with the store manager at the Starbucks location in Philadelphia to immediately issue a personal apology to Rashon Nelson, Donte Robinson, and Andrew Yaffe for the incident that occurred. I would offer to meet with them to discuss their experience in detail, listen to their concerns, and sincerely apologize on behalf of Starbucks for the mistreatment they faced. Additionally, I would offer to cover any legal fees or expenses they incurred as a result of the wrongful arrest and detention. Finally, I would personally ensure that the three individuals receive compensation for the distress and inconvenience they experienced.
