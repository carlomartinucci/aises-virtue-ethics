In this scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Reach out to Rashon Nelson, Donte Robinson, and Andrew Yaffe to personally apologize on behalf of Starbucks for the wrongful arrest and the discrimination they faced in the store.

2. Offer a formal written apology to the individuals, acknowledging the harm caused by the incident and ensuring them that the company is taking concrete steps to address the issue.

3. Provide compensation to Nelson, Robinson, and Yaffe for the distress, humiliation, and inconvenience they experienced during and after the arrest.

4. Conduct a thorough internal investigation into the incident, including the role of the store manager, the employee who called the police, and the responding police officers.

5. Implement mandatory training programs for all Starbucks employees focusing on implicit bias, diversity, and inclusion to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

6. Collaborate with local community leaders, civil rights organizations, and experts in diversity training to develop comprehensive strategies for creating a more inclusive and safe environment in all Starbucks locations.

7. Publish a detailed action plan outlining the steps the company will take to combat racial bias and discrimination within its stores, including regular progress updates and transparency in the implementation of new policies and procedures.
