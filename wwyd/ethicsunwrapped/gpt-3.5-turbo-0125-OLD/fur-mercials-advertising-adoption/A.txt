I would evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign in achieving its main goal of increasing pet adoption rates. This evaluation would include analyzing data on the number of adoptions before and after the campaign, as well as measuring the impact of the specific messaging used in the campaign on adoption numbers. Additionally, I would gather feedback from shelter staff, volunteers, and potential adopters to get a sense of how the campaign influenced their perceptions of pet adoption and the Animal Foundation. If the campaign was successful in increasing adoptions, I would consider ways to build on this success and continue promoting pet adoption in the community.
