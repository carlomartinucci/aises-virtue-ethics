I would advise Albert Snyder to respect the court's ruling and accept the decision made by the Supreme Court upholding Westboro Baptist Church's free speech rights. I would suggest that he seek support from his family, friends, and any counseling services available to cope with his emotional distress from the situation. Additionally, I would recommend that he focus on honoring his son's memory in a way that brings him peace and healing, such as creating a memorial or supporting causes that were important to his son.
