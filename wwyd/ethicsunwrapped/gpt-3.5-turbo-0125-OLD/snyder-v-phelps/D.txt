I would advise Albert Snyder to seek support and counseling to help him cope with the emotional distress caused by the Westboro Baptist Church's actions. Additionally, I would suggest exploring other legal avenues for seeking justice and recourse, such as advocating for stricter regulations on protests near funerals. It may also be beneficial to raise awareness about the impact of such hateful speech to prevent similar situations in the future.
