I would review the evidence presented in the case, including testimonies and expert opinions on the effects of Westboro Baptist Church's actions on Albert Snyder. I would assess the extent of the physical and emotional harm suffered by Albert Snyder as a result of the picketing at his son's funeral. Additionally, I would analyze the specific legal arguments made by both parties regarding the different counts brought forward in the lawsuit.

Based on this review, I would work with legal experts to determine if there are any alternative legal avenues available to seek justice for Albert Snyder. This may involve exploring potential legislative changes or advocacy efforts to address the harmful impacts of such egregious behavior at private events like funerals.

Furthermore, I would collaborate with mental health professionals to ensure Albert Snyder has access to appropriate resources and support to help him cope with the emotional distress caused by the actions of the Westboro Baptist Church. This may include facilitating counseling sessions, support groups, or other mental health interventions aimed at promoting his well-being and recovery.
