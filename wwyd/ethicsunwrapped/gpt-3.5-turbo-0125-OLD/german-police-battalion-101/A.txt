I would acknowledge that the pressure for conformity played a significant role in the decision-making of the reserve policemen from Police Battalion 101. To address this issue, I would look for ways to disrupt this group dynamic by emphasizing the importance of individual autonomy and ethical decision-making. I would create opportunities for the policemen to reflect on their own values and beliefs, encouraging them to question the morality of their actions. Additionally, I would provide support for those who express doubts or concerns about participating in the killings, ensuring that they feel empowered to make their own choices without fear of judgment or reprisal from their peers. By promoting individual agency and critical thinking, I would aim to challenge the group mentality that contributed to the willingness of these men to participate in the mass murder of civilians.
