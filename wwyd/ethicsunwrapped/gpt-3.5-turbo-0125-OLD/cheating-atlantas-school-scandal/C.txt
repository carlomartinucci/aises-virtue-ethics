Given the scenario, I would have initially expressed my concerns about the request to change students' test answers to the new principal, Christopher Waller. I would have explained that such actions are dishonest and unethical, and that it would be unfair to the students, the school, and the education system as a whole. I would have also discussed alternative strategies to support the students in improving their performance, such as extra tutoring, personalized support, or alternative assessments.

If my initial concerns were not taken seriously and the pressure to change answers persisted, I would have then reported the situation to the appropriate authorities, such as the district superintendent or the school board. I would have provided factual information about the request to change test answers and explained my reasons for objecting to such actions.

If the cheating scandal had come to light despite my efforts, I would have cooperated fully with the investigation and provided all necessary information to help clarify the situation. I would have taken responsibility for my actions, expressed remorse for participating in the cheating, and accepted any consequences that resulted from my involvement.
