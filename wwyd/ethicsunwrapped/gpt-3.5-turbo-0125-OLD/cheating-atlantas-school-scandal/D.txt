Based on the scenario presented, I would have refused to change the students' answers on the standardized tests, even if pressured by the new principal. Instead, I would have expressed my concerns about this unethical practice to the principal or sought guidance from higher authorities within the school district to address the issues that led to the need for such cheating. I would have prioritized my commitment to academic integrity, even if it meant facing potential consequences or losing my job.
