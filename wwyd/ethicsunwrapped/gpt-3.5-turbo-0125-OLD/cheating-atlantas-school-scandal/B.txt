In this case, I would report the incident of changing the students' answers on standardized tests to the appropriate authorities, such as the school district superintendent or the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. I would provide them with all the information I have about the situation, including the individuals involved and the extent of the cheating that took place. I would cooperate fully with any investigation and provide any testimony or evidence needed to uncover the truth about what happened at Parks Middle School.
