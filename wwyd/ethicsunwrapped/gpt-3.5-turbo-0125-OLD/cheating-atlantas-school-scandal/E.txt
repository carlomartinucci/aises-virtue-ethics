As an assistant in this scenario, I would analyze the situation and consider the consequences of changing students' answers on standardized tests. I would suggest that Damany Lewis not participate in altering the students' exam answers, as it violates ethical standards and integrity in education. Instead, I would recommend that Lewis address the systemic issues at the school, collaborate with colleagues to find alternative solutions, and advocate for additional resources and support for the students to help them succeed without compromising their educational integrity. Lewis could also consider reaching out to educational authorities or advocacy groups to highlight the challenges faced by Parks Middle School and seek assistance in a transparent and ethical manner.
