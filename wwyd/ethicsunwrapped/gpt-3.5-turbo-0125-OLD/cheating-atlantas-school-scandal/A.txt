I would report the incident of changing students' answers on standardized tests to the appropriate authorities, such as the school district administration or the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Then, I would cooperate fully with the investigation and provide any information or evidence I have regarding the cheating that took place at Parks Middle School. It is important to ensure that the integrity of the education system is maintained and that proper actions are taken to address the cheating that occurred.
