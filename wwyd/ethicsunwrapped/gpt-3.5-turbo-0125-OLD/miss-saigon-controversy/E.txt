Given the situation with Miss Saigon and the controversy surrounding the casting of Jonathan Pryce as the Eurasian 'Engineer,' if I were involved in the decision-making process, I would first acknowledge the concerns raised by B.D. Wong and other members of the Asian American community regarding the issue of "yellow-face" casting.

I would then initiate a dialogue with key stakeholders, including Actorsâ€™ Equity Association, Asian American advocacy groups, and members of the production team, to discuss potential solutions. This could involve considering the possibility of recasting the role with an Asian actor to promote more authentic representation and diversity on stage. If recasting is not feasible due to contractual obligations or other constraints, I would explore other ways to address the concerns, such as providing opportunities for Asian American actors in other roles within the production or engaging in community outreach initiatives to raise awareness about the importance of diversity and representation in the performing arts.

Ultimately, my goal would be to find a solution that respects the concerns of the Asian American community while also ensuring the integrity of the production and the artistic vision of the creative team. By engaging in open and transparent communication and actively seeking input from all stakeholders, I would strive to address the issue in a constructive and collaborative manner.
