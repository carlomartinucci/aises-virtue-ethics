As a response to this scenario, I would first acknowledge the concerns raised by Asian American actors and the broader community regarding the casting choice in Miss Saigon. I would reach out to Asian American theater organizations and activists to listen to their perspectives and understand the impact of casting decisions on representation in the performing arts.

Next, I would work with the producers, casting team, and creative team to explore alternative casting options that prioritize authentic representation. This could involve conducting a new casting search specifically targeting Asian actors for the role of ‘the Engineer’ and considering the feedback provided by the community during this process.

Additionally, I would engage in open dialogue with the Actors’ Equity Association to discuss their initial decision to refuse Pryce's performance and the subsequent reversal. Understanding their perspective and the reasons behind their actions would be crucial in determining how to move forward in a way that respects the concerns raised by the Asian American community.

Ultimately, my goal would be to promote inclusivity and authenticity in casting decisions for productions like Miss Saigon, ensuring that diverse voices are represented on stage in a responsible and respectful manner.
