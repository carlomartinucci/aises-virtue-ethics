I would have a conversation with Asian American actor B.D. Wong to understand his perspective on the casting of Jonathan Pryce in the role of 'the Engineer' in Miss Saigon. I would listen to Wong's concerns about representation and inclusion in the performing arts industry, and acknowledge the importance of authenticity and diversity in casting decisions. Additionally, I would express empathy towards Wong's advocacy for racial authenticity and the impact of such casting choices on the Asian American community. Lastly, I would work towards finding ways to ensure more opportunities for Asian actors in the industry and advocate for inclusive casting practices in future productions.
