In this scenario, I would actively engage with the Asian American community and advocacy groups to understand their perspective on the casting of Jonathan Pryce as the Eurasian character in Miss Saigon. I would listen to their concerns and prioritize their voices in the decision-making process. Additionally, I would work with the producers and creative team to explore alternative casting options that would promote diversity and authenticity in representation, ensuring that the Asian community feels respected and represented in the production.
