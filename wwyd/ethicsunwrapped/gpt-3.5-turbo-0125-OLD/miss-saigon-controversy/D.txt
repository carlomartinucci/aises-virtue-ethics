In this scenario, I would actively listen to the concerns and feedback from both sides of the debate - those who are advocating for racial authenticity in casting and those who emphasize the importance of talent and artistic merit. I would engage in open dialogue with Asian American actors, members of the Asian community, producers, casting directors, and union representatives to understand their perspectives and experiences.

I would work towards finding a solution that respects diversity and representation while also acknowledging the artistic intentions of the production. This could involve considering alternative casting choices that align with the original vision of the musical while also providing opportunities for talented actors from underrepresented backgrounds. I would explore ways to increase opportunities for Asian American actors in the performing arts industry and promote inclusive casting practices.

Additionally, I would collaborate with theater organizations and industry stakeholders to develop guidelines and best practices for casting that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. By creating a more inclusive and transparent casting process, we can work towards addressing the concerns raised by the controversy surrounding the casting decisions in Miss Saigon and help foster a more diverse and representative theatrical landscape.
