I would advise the social worker to seek supervision or consultation from a senior colleague or supervisor to discuss the ethical dilemma they are facing in treating a gay client while holding religious beliefs that oppose homosexuality. During the supervision session, the social worker can explore their own values and biases, examine how these might be influencing their ability to provide unbiased treatment, and work on strategies to ensure that their personal beliefs do not negatively impact the care they provide to the client. Additionally, the social worker may consider referring the client to a colleague or mental health professional who is better suited to address the client's needs without the interference of personal beliefs.
