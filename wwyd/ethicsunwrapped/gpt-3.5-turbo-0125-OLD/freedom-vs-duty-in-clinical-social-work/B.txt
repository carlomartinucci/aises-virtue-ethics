In this scenario, I would first acknowledge the internal conflict the social worker is experiencing due to their religious beliefs conflicting with their duty to provide unbiased mental health treatment services. I would then suggest that the social worker seek supervision from a senior colleague or consult with a professional ethics committee within their organization to discuss the situation and explore potential options for resolving the ethical dilemma. Additionally, I would recommend that the social worker undergo additional training or continuing education to enhance their cultural competence and understanding of working with clients who have diverse sexual orientations. Ultimately, the goal would be to ensure that the client's needs are prioritized and that they continue to receive appropriate and unbiased mental health support, whether that is through the current social worker or through a referral to another therapist.
