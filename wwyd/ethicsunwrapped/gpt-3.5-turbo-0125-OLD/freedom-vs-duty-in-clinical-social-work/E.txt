I would first recognize that my own personal beliefs and values may be influencing my reaction to the client, and consider seeking consultation from a supervisor or colleague to gain insight into how to manage this conflict in an ethical manner. I would then explore with the client how their sexual orientation and relationship are affecting their mental health, without imposing my personal beliefs on them. If I feel that I cannot provide unbiased treatment due to my own beliefs, I would ethically and respectfully refer the client to another therapist who can better support them without any judgment or discrimination based on their sexual orientation.
