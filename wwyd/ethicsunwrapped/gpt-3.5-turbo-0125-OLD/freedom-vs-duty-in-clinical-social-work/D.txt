I would suggest the clinical social worker consult with a supervisor or colleague who is experienced in addressing ethical dilemmas. This would help the social worker gain insight and guidance on how to navigate the conflict between their own religious beliefs and the professional obligation to provide unbiased mental health treatment services to the client. The supervisor could provide support and help the social worker explore alternative courses of action that uphold both ethical responsibilities and respect for the client's autonomy and well-being.
