I would consult with a supervisor or a colleague who has experience in ethical decision-making in social work. I would discuss the specifics of the situation, including the client's needs, the ethical obligations outlined in the NASW Code of Ethics, and my own personal beliefs. I would seek guidance on how best to navigate this ethical dilemma while prioritizing the client's well-being and right to receive unbiased mental health services. Together, we would explore potential options and their implications before making a decision on how to proceed with the client's therapy.
