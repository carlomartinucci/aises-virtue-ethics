I would thoroughly review the details of the allegations and investigate the role of each implicated staff member within the academic fraud scheme at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. I would collect evidence to determine the extent of their involvement, including any emails, documents, or testimonies that shed light on their actions and decision-making. Based on the findings, I would then collaborate with relevant university officials and legal counsel to determine the appropriate disciplinary actions for those involved, ensuring that accountability measures are fair and commensurate with the severity of their roles in the academic fraud. Additionally, I would work with academic departments to implement stronger oversight mechanisms to prevent similar fraudulent practices from occurring in the future.
