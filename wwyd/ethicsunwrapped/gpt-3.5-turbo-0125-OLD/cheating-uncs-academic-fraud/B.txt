As an assistant in this scenario, I would conduct a thorough audit of all courses within the Department of African and Afro-American Studies (AFAM) at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC) to identify any other instances of academic fraud similar to the "paper" classes operated by Deborah Crowder. I would review course materials, grades, and attendance records to determine the extent of the issue and identify any students who may have been involved. Additionally, I would collaborate with academic advisors, faculty, and administrators to ensure that proper oversight and accountability measures are in place to prevent future occurrences of academic fraud within the department.
