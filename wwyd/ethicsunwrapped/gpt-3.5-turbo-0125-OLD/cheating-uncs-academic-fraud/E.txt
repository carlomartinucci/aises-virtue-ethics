As a learning specialist at UNC, my concrete action would be to continue working towards improving academic support for student-athletes and ensuring that they receive a genuine education. This would involve closely monitoring the academic progress of student-athletes, providing individualized support to address any deficiencies, and advocating for academic integrity within the university. Furthermore, I would collaborate with other faculty members and administrators to establish clear academic standards and ensure that all students, including athletes, have access to legitimate and valuable educational opportunities.
