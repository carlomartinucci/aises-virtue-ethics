I would help facilitate the auditing process at UNC by ensuring that classroom and coursework audits are conducted thoroughly and regularly. This would involve working closely with the accreditation organization to establish clear procedures and standards for auditing academic courses, especially in departments where fraudulent classes were identified. I would collaborate with academic departments to develop and implement strict protocols for course offerings, syllabi creation, grading practices, and student assessment to prevent any future academic fraud. Additionally, I would provide support and resources to faculty and staff members involved in the audit process to ensure compliance and accountability in maintaining academic integrity at the university.
