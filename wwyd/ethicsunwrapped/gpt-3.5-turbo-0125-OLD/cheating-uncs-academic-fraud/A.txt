I would work with university officials to establish clear academic guidelines and oversight mechanisms to prevent academic fraud in the future. This would include implementing stringent course approval processes to ensure that all students, including student-athletes, are taking appropriate courses based on their academic levels. Additionally, I would conduct regular audits of courses and assignments to verify academic integrity and prevent the possibility of fraudulent classes like the ones in the AFAM department. It is crucial to prioritize the education and well-being of all students to uphold the integrity of the university's academic programs.
