In this scenario, I would take the following specific actions: I would first review the guidelines and policies regarding reporting on sensitive topics, such as suicides, set by the news organization I work for. Then, I would have a conversation with my editorial team to discuss the different viewpoints presented by members of the public, mental health experts, and journalists regarding the reporting of Robin Williams's suicide. After understanding the perspectives, I would work on developing a balanced approach to reporting on the story that respects the family's privacy while also providing accurate information to the public. This could involve deciding to limit the graphic details of the suicide method in our coverage and focusing more on the impact of mental health issues and the importance of seeking help. Additionally, I would consider including information about suicide prevention resources and helplines for those in need.
