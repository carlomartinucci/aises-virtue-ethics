In this scenario, I would prioritize respecting the privacy and grieving process of Robin Williams's family by not including unnecessary graphic details of his suicide in any news reports or coverage. I would focus on reporting the story accurately and factually while keeping in mind the potential impact of the information shared on sensitive topics like suicide. I would work towards balancing the public interest in the story with the need to be respectful and mindful of the feelings of the family and the broader community affected by the loss.
