If I were involved as an assistant to Rick Singer in this scenario, I would refuse to participate in any illegal activities or schemes that involve manipulating college admissions processes through bribery or fraud. If I were to discover any unethical actions being undertaken by Rick Singer or his clients, I would immediately report this behavior to the appropriate authorities, such as law enforcement or the university admissions offices, to ensure that justice is served and that the integrity of the college admissions system is maintained.
