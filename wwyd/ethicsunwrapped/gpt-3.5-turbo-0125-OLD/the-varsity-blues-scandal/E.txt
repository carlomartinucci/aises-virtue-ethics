I would report Rick Singer's fraudulent activities to the appropriate authorities, such as the FBI or the Department of Justice. I would provide them with any evidence or information I have regarding Singer's methods of cheating and manipulating the college admissions process, including details about his involvement with underpaid coaches, bribing test administrators, fabricating athletic profiles, and manipulating standardized test scores. By cooperating with the authorities, I would ensure that Singer is held accountable for his illegal actions and that justice is served for those affected by the scandal.
