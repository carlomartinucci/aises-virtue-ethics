If I were in a position to uncover Rick Singer's "side door" method being used by parents to secure college admissions fraudulently, I would immediately report the information to the appropriate authorities. This could include submitting a tip to the FBI or the Department of Justice, providing any evidence or information gathered on the fraudulent activities. Additionally, I would cooperate fully with any investigations or inquiries to help ensure that justice is served and that the integrity of the college admissions process is upheld.
