I would contact the appropriate authorities, such as law enforcement or relevant regulatory bodies, to report the fraudulent activities of Rick Singer and the parents involved in the college admissions scandal. I would provide any evidence or information I have about the illegal schemes, including the manipulation of standardized test scores and the fabrication of athletic profiles. Additionally, I would cooperate fully with any investigations to ensure that justice is served and the integrity of the college admissions process is upheld.
