If I were aware of Rick Singer's unethical activities and how he exploited the college admissions process, my immediate actions would involve reporting the information to relevant authorities such as law enforcement agencies, educational institutions, and other appropriate entities. This would include providing any evidence or information I have about Singer's illegal tactics, the involved parents, and any accomplices.

Additionally, I would proactively collaborate with investigative authorities if they needed further assistance or details to build their case against Singer and the implicated parents. It is crucial to facilitate the legal process and cooperate fully to ensure accountability and justice in this case.

Furthermore, I would advocate for transparency and integrity within the college admissions system by supporting initiatives to prevent similar fraudulent practices in the future. This could involve promoting reforms in admissions policies and procedures to enhance fairness and equal opportunity for all students. It is essential to uphold the credibility of educational institutions and maintain trust in the admissions process.

Lastly, I would provide support and guidance to any individuals affected by the scandal, including students who may have been wrongfully denied admissions due to Singer's schemes, and work towards addressing the repercussions of the fraudulent actions on the broader educational community.
