I would support Valerie Plame's concerns about the dangers posed by President Trump's pardon of Scooter Libby by working within the CIA to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to protect the safety and security of covert operatives and operations. This might include working with CIA leadership to strengthen internal security protocols and counterintelligence measures, as well as advocating for increased awareness among government officials about the potential consequences of exposing classified information. Additionally, I would collaborate with relevant stakeholders to emphasize the importance of maintaining the integrity of covert operations and protecting the identities of CIA personnel.
