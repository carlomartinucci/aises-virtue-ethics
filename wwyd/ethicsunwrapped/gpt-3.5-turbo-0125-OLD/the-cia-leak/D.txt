I would advise the CIA to carefully monitor any potential threats and risks that may arise as a result of Libby's pardon. This would involve assessing any potential implications for the safety of covert operatives and the operations of the CIA. Additionally, I would recommend that the CIA engage in ongoing dialogue with relevant stakeholders to address concerns and to strategize on how to mitigate any adverse effects stemming from the pardon. Additionally, the CIA could consider implementing additional security measures or protocols to enhance the protection of its operatives and operations in light of this development.
