I would carefully review the facts and circumstances surrounding the pardon of Scooter Libby by President Donald Trump in 2018. I would then work to understand the implications of this pardon on national security, particularly on the safety of covert operatives and the operations of the CIA. I would also consider reaching out to relevant stakeholders within the CIA and the broader intelligence community to gather their perspectives on the impact of the pardon. Additionally, I would assess any potential risks or threats that could arise from the precedent set by this pardon, and consider proposing measures to mitigate these risks to ensure the continued safety and effectiveness of CIA operations.
