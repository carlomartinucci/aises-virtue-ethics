I would acknowledge the horrific atrocities committed by Franz Stangl as the commandant of the Sobib√≥r and Treblinka death camps during the Holocaust. I would ensure that his actions are not minimized or justified in any way. I would emphasize the importance of holding individuals accountable for their roles in such egregious crimes against humanity.
