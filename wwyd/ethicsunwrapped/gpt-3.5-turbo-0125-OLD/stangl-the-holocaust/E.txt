I would recognize the severity of Franz Stangl's actions and acknowledge the tremendous suffering he caused to countless individuals and their families. In the context of his trial, I would ensure that justice is served by providing a fair and thorough legal process that considers all evidence and testimonies. Additionally, I would work to uphold the rule of law and ensure that Stangl is held accountable for the atrocities he committed, in accordance with international legal standards. This would involve documenting the testimonies of survivors and witnesses, analyzing relevant historical records, and seeking to provide closure and justice to the victims and their families.
