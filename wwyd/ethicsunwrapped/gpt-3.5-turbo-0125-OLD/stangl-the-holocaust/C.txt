Considering the scenario presented, I would ensure that Stangl is held accountable for his role in the Holocaust by cooperating with authorities and providing any information that could contribute to the prosecution of those responsible for these heinous crimes. This includes testifying in court, sharing any relevant documents or evidence, and providing a full and honest account of his actions and responsibilities while serving in the Nazi regime. Additionally, I would support efforts to educate future generations about the atrocities committed during this dark period of history, with a focus on preventing such acts from happening again.
