I would help ensure that Franz Stangl's role and actions during the Holocaust are accurately documented and preserved in historical records. This could involve assisting historians and researchers in compiling information about his deeds, motivations, and impact during his time as a senior official in the Nazi regime. Additionally, I would support efforts to educate future generations about the atrocities committed during the Holocaust, including Stangl's involvement, in order to prevent such horrors from happening again. This could involve participating in events or initiatives that promote Holocaust education and remembrance, and collaborating with relevant institutions to make sure that the lessons from this dark period of history are not forgotten.
