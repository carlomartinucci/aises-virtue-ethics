I would acknowledge the deep suffering and trauma that Stangl inflicted on countless innocent individuals and their families. I would also recognize the immense responsibility that comes with holding a position of authority and power, especially in situations where human lives are at stake. Given Stangl's role in orchestrating the systematic genocide of hundreds of thousands of people at Treblinka, I would ensure that his actions are not forgotten or minimized, and that the memory of his victims is honored and respected.
