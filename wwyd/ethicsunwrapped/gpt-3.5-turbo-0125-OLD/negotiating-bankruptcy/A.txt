In this scenario, I would ensure full transparency and disclosure of all potential conflicts of interest to the bankruptcy judge when filing documents under oath on behalf of BE as their counsel. Specifically, I would disclose to the court the fact that Milbank Tweed was representing both South Street and Mikael Salovaara in various matters related to the bankruptcy proceedings. By providing this information upfront, I would uphold ethical standards and prevent any potential conflicts of interest from arising during the reorganization process.
