I would have immediately disclosed to the bankruptcy judge the fact that Milbank Tweed was representing both South Street and Mikael Salovaara in various matters when filing the Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on behalf of BE. This disclosure would have helped to ensure transparency and avoid any potential conflicts of interest during the reorganization bankruptcy proceedings.
