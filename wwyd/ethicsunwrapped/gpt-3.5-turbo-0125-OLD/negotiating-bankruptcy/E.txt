I would advise John Gellene to fully disclose all potential conflicts of interest that Milbank Tweed may have in the bankruptcy proceedings of Bucyrus-Erie (BE) to the bankruptcy judge immediately. Gellene should inform the judge about the firm's representation of both South Street and Mikael Salovaara in other matters to ensure transparency and avoid any appearance of impropriety. It is crucial to be honest and open about all connections, even if they may not be seen as direct conflicts, to uphold the integrity of the legal process.
