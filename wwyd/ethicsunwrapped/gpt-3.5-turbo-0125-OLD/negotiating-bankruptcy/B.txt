I would not advise John Gellene to intentionally withhold information about potential conflicts of interest from the bankruptcy judge. To rectify the situation, Gellene should immediately disclose to the court the existing connections between Milbank Tweed, South Street, and Mikael Salovaara, providing full transparency about the relationships involved. Gellene should also acknowledge the oversight and take responsibility for the failure to disclose this information earlier. This transparency could potentially prevent any further legal implications and demonstrate a commitment to honesty and integrity in the matter.
