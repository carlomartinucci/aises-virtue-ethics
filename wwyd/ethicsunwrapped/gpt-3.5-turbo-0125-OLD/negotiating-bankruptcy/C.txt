If I were in this scenario, I would immediately gather all relevant documents and information, including the bankruptcy petition filed by Gellene, the disclosure documents, and any communications related to the representation of South Street and Salovaara by Milbank Tweed. Once I have compiled this evidence, I would consult with the law firm's senior management and legal ethics experts to conduct a thorough internal investigation.

During this investigation, I would ensure that all parties involved are interviewed, including John Gellene, Larry Lederman, and any other relevant individuals who may have knowledge of the situation. I would also review the law firm's policies and procedures regarding conflicts of interest and ethical conduct to determine if any breaches occurred beyond Gellene's actions.

Based on the findings of the investigation, I would take appropriate actions, which may include disclosing the oversight to the bankruptcy court, cooperating with the ongoing legal proceedings involving JNL's lawsuit, implementing additional training or oversight measures to prevent similar incidents in the future, and potentially taking disciplinary actions against any individuals found to have knowingly failed to disclose conflicts of interest.

Throughout this process, I would prioritize transparency, accountability, and compliance with ethical obligations to uphold the integrity of the legal profession and the reputation of the law firm.
