If I were handling this situation, I would initiate a thorough review of the research practices and procedures at both Heidelberg University in Germany and Wayne State University in the United States regarding the use of human cadavers in simulated car crash tests. This review would aim to gather information on the specific protocols followed, the ethical considerations taken into account, and the consent procedures in place for the use of cadavers.

Furthermore, I would organize a meeting or forum involving representatives from academia, medical ethics committees, government officials, and stakeholders in the community to openly discuss and evaluate the research methods and their ethical implications. This forum would provide a platform to address the concerns raised by different groups, explore alternative research methods, and potentially develop guidelines for conducting such studies in an ethically sound manner.

Lastly, I would work towards establishing clear guidelines and regulations for the use of human cadavers in research, ensuring that the dignity of deceased individuals is respected, consent procedures are rigorously followed, and that the research outcomes truly justify the use of human cadavers over alternative methods such as crash test dummies.
