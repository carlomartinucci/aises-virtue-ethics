If I were involved in this scenario, I would immediately initiate a comprehensive review of the research practices at Heidelberg University, particularly focusing on the ethical considerations surrounding the use of human cadavers in crash tests. This review would involve consulting with experts in medical ethics and forensic pathology to assess the necessity of using cadavers over alternative methods like crash test dummies.

Additionally, I would collaborate with legal experts to examine the consent process for obtaining the cadavers, ensuring that all ethical and legal protocols were followed. Any lapses in consent procedures would be thoroughly investigated and addressed accordingly.

Furthermore, I would work closely with university officials to implement transparent communication strategies with the public, addressing concerns and clarifying the ethical justifications for the research. Engaging in meaningful dialogue with stakeholders, such as advocacy groups, political leaders, and the general public, would be essential to rebuilding trust and credibility.

Ultimately, the goal would be to strike a balance between advancing scientific knowledge and upholding ethical standards, ensuring that future research at the university adheres to the highest ethical principles and respects the dignity of human subjects.
