If I were in this situation, I would prioritize the need to ensure that the ethical concerns raised by various groups are addressed. My specific action would be to advocate for a comprehensive review of the research practices at Heidelberg University and Wayne State University to verify if all necessary ethical guidelines were followed.

I would propose establishing an independent ethical committee to investigate and monitor the research activities involving human cadavers at both institutions. This committee would be tasked with evaluating whether informed consent was obtained from the families of the deceased individuals used in the crash tests. Additionally, the committee would assess whether the research indeed provided unique insights that could not have been achieved through alternative means, such as advanced crash test dummies.

I would recommend that the universities engage in a dialogue with the concerned groups, including the ADAC, the Roman Catholic German Bishopsâ€™ Conference, and political leaders, to address their ethical concerns and provide transparency about the research methods and outcomes. It is crucial to take into account the perspectives of all stakeholders and work towards finding a consensus that upholds ethical standards while also advancing scientific knowledge in a responsible manner.
