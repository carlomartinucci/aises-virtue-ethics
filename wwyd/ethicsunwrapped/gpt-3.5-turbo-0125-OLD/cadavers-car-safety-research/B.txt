As a response to the situation at Heidelberg University in Germany, I would recommend conducting a thorough review of the research protocols and practices surrounding the use of human cadavers in simulated car crash tests. This review should include an assessment of the necessity of using human cadavers over crash test dummies, the ethical implications of conducting such tests, and the consent procedures in place for obtaining the cadavers. Additionally, I would suggest engaging with stakeholders such as the public, relevant organizations, and governmental bodies to address their concerns and gather feedback on how to proceed with the research in a more ethical and socially acceptable manner. If the research is deemed to be essential for advancing vehicle safety, efforts should be made to enhance transparency, ensure proper ethical oversight, and prioritize the well-being and dignity of individuals involved in the research process.
