If I were involved in this scenario, I would work towards ensuring that strict protocols and guidelines are established for research involving human cadavers. This would include ensuring that informed consent is obtained from the families of the deceased individuals used in the research. I would also advocate for the continuous monitoring and evaluation of the research practices to make sure that ethical standards are being upheld. Additionally, I would facilitate discussions between all relevant stakeholders, including researchers, ethicists, policymakers, and representatives from advocacy groups, to address concerns and find a balance between the need for research data and the respect for human dignity and ethics.
