I would conduct a thorough analysis of the potential environmental impacts of offshore drilling in the Arctic, taking into account factors such as the unique ecosystem of the region, the challenges of operating in icy waters, and the potential risks to endangered species such as polar bears and whales. I would also evaluate the specific measures that Royal Dutch Shell has proposed to mitigate these risks, such as spill response plans and wildlife protection protocols. Based on this assessment, I would provide President Obama with a detailed report outlining the potential benefits and risks of expanding drilling in the region and make a recommendation on whether to proceed with the permit for Shell or consider alternative approaches to energy development in the Arctic.
