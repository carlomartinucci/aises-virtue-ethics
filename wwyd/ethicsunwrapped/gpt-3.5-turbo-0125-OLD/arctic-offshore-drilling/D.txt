As a consultant to the President on this issue, I would recommend convening a diverse panel of experts comprising environmentalists, scientists, energy industry representatives, and indigenous community leaders to conduct a comprehensive impact assessment of offshore drilling in the Arctic. The panel should be tasked with evaluating the potential risks to the environment, wildlife, and local communities, as well as the economic benefits and national security implications of such drilling activities. Based on the findings of this assessment, I would advise the President to make an informed decision on whether to continue, modify, or halt offshore drilling operations in the Arctic region.
