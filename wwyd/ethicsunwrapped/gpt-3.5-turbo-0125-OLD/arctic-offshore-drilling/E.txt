I would conduct a comprehensive environmental impact assessment specifically focusing on the potential risks and consequences of offshore drilling in the Arctic. This assessment would include researching and analyzing the potential impact on the vulnerable Arctic ecosystem, wildlife, and indigenous communities. Additionally, I would assess the feasibility and effectiveness of oil spill response plans in the challenging Arctic environment. This analysis would provide concrete data on the potential harm that could be caused by offshore drilling, which could inform future decisions on whether to proceed with such activities in the region.
