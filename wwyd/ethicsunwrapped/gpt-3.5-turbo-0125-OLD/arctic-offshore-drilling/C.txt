I would conduct a thorough environmental impact assessment of the proposed offshore drilling in the Arctic. This assessment would involve studying potential risks to the Arctic environment and wildlife, evaluating the capacity of oil companies to respond to and clean up potential spills in icy waters, and considering the long-term consequences of further fossil fuel extraction on global climate change. I would involve a team of environmental experts, biologists, and climate scientists to provide comprehensive insights into the potential impacts of offshore drilling in the Arctic. The findings of this assessment would then inform any further decisions or policy recommendations regarding the expansion of drilling activities in the region, taking into account the concerns raised by environmentalists and stakeholders like the Sierra Club.
