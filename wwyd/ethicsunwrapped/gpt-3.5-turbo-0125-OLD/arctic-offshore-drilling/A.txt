One concrete action to take in this scenario would be to conduct a thorough and independent environmental impact assessment of the proposed offshore drilling expansion in Alaska. This assessment should involve studying potential risks to the local ecosystems, wildlife, and indigenous communities in the Arctic region. It should also evaluate the capability of oil companies, such as Shell, to effectively address and clean up oil spills in icy waters.

This assessment should be comprehensive and transparent, involving input from various stakeholders, including environmental experts, scientists, local residents, and indigenous groups. The findings of this assessment should be made public to ensure transparency and accountability in the decision-making process surrounding offshore drilling in the Arctic.

Based on this environmental impact assessment, specific guidelines and regulations can be put in place to mitigate the potential risks of offshore drilling in the Arctic and to ensure that environmental protection standards are upheld. Additionally, measures should be implemented to monitor and enforce compliance with these regulations to safeguard the fragile ecosystems and wildlife in the region.
