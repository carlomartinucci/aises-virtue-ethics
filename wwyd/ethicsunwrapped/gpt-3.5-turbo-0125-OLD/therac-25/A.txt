I would promptly inform the authorities, including the FDA, about the inaccuracies in the statements made by AECL regarding the safety of the Therac-25 machines after the FDA placed a shutdown on all machines in 1987. I would provide detailed documentation and evidence to support my claims, highlighting the inadequacies in the redesign of safety features, software, and mechanical interlocks. Furthermore, I would urge for a thorough investigation into the software design, testing processes, and the incorporation of software from earlier versions of the machine despite known issues. It is essential to ensure that the truth is revealed and that necessary measures are taken to prevent further harm to patients and to hold those responsible for the errors accountable.
