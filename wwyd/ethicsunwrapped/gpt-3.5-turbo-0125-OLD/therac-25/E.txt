I would promptly gather all available information on the Therac-25 incidents, including reports from patients, technicians, and regulatory agencies. I would arrange a meeting with the team responsible for the Therac-25 project to discuss the design flaws, software errors, and inadequate safety features that led to the accidents. I would prioritize identifying the root causes of the issues and developing a comprehensive plan to address them effectively. This would involve thorough testing of the software, redesigning safety features, and implementing rigorous quality control measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. Additionally, I would ensure open communication with regulatory bodies, investigators, and the public to provide transparency and accountability throughout the process of rectifying the problems with the Therac-25 machine.
