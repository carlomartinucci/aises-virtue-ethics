I would initiate an immediate investigation into the design, development, and testing processes of the Therac-25 machine, focusing on the software components that were identified as problematic. I would assemble a team of experts in software engineering, medical physics, and radiation therapy to thoroughly examine how the software errors occurred and why they were not caught during the development and testing phases.

Additionally, I would review the documentation related to the reuse of software components from earlier machine versions, specifically the Therac-6 and Therac-20, to understand why the safety features present in those machines were not fully incorporated into the Therac-25. This analysis would help us identify gaps in the software design and testing procedures that led to the lack of adequate safety controls in the Therac-25.

Furthermore, I would collaborate with regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. This would involve sharing our findings from the investigation, implementing stricter reporting requirements for medical device manufacturers, and advocating for more transparent communication between companies and regulatory bodies regarding the safety of their products.

Overall, my immediate action would be to investigate the root causes of the software errors in the Therac-25 machine, address the gaps in design and testing processes, and work towards enhancing accountability and transparency in the development of critical life services controlled by computer systems.
