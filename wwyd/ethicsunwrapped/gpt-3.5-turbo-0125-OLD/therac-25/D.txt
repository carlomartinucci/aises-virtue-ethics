In this scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Conduct a thorough investigation within the company to identify all individuals involved in the design, development, and testing of the Therac-25 machine. Gather all available documentation, such as design specifications, testing reports, and communication records to understand the decision-making processes that led to the deficiencies in the machine's safety features.

2. Organize a multi-disciplinary team consisting of software engineers, hardware engineers, medical experts, and regulatory compliance specialists to assess the root causes of the design flaws in the Therac-25 machine. This team should review the differences in safety controls between the Therac-25 and the earlier versions (Therac-6 and Therac-20) to identify specific areas for improvement.

3. Collaborate with external independent experts in medical device safety and computer systems to conduct an in-depth review of the software design and testing practices used for the Therac-25 machine. Identify specific instances where industry best practices were not followed and propose corrective actions to avoid similar incidents in the future.

4. Implement a comprehensive quality assurance program that includes rigorous testing protocols, independent verification of safety features, and continuous monitoring of software updates for all existing and future medical devices developed by the company. This program should prioritize patient safety and regulatory compliance at every stage of the product development lifecycle.

5. Engage in open and transparent communication with regulatory agencies, healthcare providers, and the public to provide regular updates on the progress of the investigation, corrective actions taken, and any additional safety measures implemented to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Transparency and accountability are essential in rebuilding trust with stakeholders affected by the Therac-25 accidents.
