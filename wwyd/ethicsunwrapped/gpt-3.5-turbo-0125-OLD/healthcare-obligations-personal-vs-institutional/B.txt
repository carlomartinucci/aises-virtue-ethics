I would advise Dr. Jones to conduct a thorough review of the research reports regarding the efficacy and potential risks associated with flu shots, paying close attention to the specific findings, methodologies, and conclusions presented in each study. 

After reviewing the research, I would suggest that Dr. Jones consult with trusted colleagues or mentors within the medical community to discuss her concerns and to seek alternative perspectives on the issue. It would be important for her to gather diverse opinions and insights in order to make a well-rounded and informed decision.

I would recommend that Dr. Jones carefully consider the potential consequences of her actions, both in terms of her relationship with the AMA and her hospital, as well as the impact on her patients. It may be beneficial for her to explore ways to communicate her reservations about flu shots to her senior patients in a respectful and informative manner, while also highlighting the importance of individual patient autonomy in healthcare decision-making.

Additionally, I would encourage Dr. Jones to stay up to date on any new developments in the field of flu vaccines and to remain open to revisiting her views based on new evidence or information that may arise in the future. Keeping an open mind and being willing to adapt one's stance in light of new evidence is crucial in the practice of medicine.
