I would advise Dr. Jones to have a private, one-on-one conversation with her senior patients to discuss her reservations about the efficacy of flu shots for their age group. During this conversation, she can share the information from the reports she has read, explaining the findings and implications clearly and honestly. Dr. Jones should ensure that her patients have all the necessary information to make an informed decision about their health care. Additionally, she should reassure her patients that she respects their right to make their own choices regarding their health and that she is committed to providing them with the best possible care based on her medical expertise and ethical principles.
