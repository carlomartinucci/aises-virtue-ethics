In this scenario, I would suggest that Dr. Jones carefully review the reports and research findings on flu vaccine effectiveness and adverse events. 

Based on this information, Dr. Jones should consider having a conversation with her senior patients about the flu shot, providing them with a summary of the findings and research on its effectiveness and risks for their age group. She should ensure that the information is presented in a clear and understandable manner, allowing her patients to make informed decisions about receiving the flu shot.

Dr. Jones should also document her conversations and the information provided to her patients in their medical records, ensuring that she is acting in accordance with the AMA Code of Ethics and promoting patient autonomy in healthcare decision-making.

Additionally, Dr. Jones may want to explore alternative methods of protecting her senior patients against influenza, such as discussing other preventive measures or vaccines that may be more effective for their age group.

Lastly, Dr. Jones should be prepared to handle any potential repercussions from her hospital or the AMA for her actions, and may consider seeking guidance from medical ethics committees or legal advisors if needed.
