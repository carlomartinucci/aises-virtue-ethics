If I were in Egil "Bud" Krogh's position during the meeting where the break-in was proposed and approved, I would have raised concerns about the legality and morality of the operation. I would have insisted on a thorough discussion on whether the operation was necessary and justified under the law. I would have pushed for exploring alternative, lawful ways to address the issue without resorting to illegal activities. If a consensus was reached that the break-in was illegal, I would have refused to participate and made it clear that I could not be involved in any activities that violated the law or ethical standards. Additionally, I would have documented my objections and concerns in writing to create a record of my ethical stance in the event of any repercussions in the future.
