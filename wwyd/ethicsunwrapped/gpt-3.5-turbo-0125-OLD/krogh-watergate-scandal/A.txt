If I were in Egil "Bud" Krogh's position during the meeting where the illegal break-in at Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office was proposed and approved, I would have raised immediate concerns about the legality and morality of the operation. I would have urged that alternative, legal methods be explored to address the situation, emphasizing the importance of upholding the law and ethical standards in any actions taken. Additionally, I would have pushed for a thorough evaluation of the potential consequences and risks of such an operation, highlighting the potential damage to both national security and individual rights. I would have firmly stated my reservations and opposition to pursuing an illegal course of action, even in response to perceived national security concerns.
