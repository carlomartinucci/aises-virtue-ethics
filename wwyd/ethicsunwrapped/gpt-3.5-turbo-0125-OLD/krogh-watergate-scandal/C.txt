If I were in Egil Krogh's position during the meeting where the break-in was proposed and approved, I would have pushed back against the plan, expressing concerns about the legality and ethics of the operation. I would have emphasized the importance of maintaining integrity and upholding the rule of law in carrying out any actions, especially ones with such serious implications. Additionally, I would have suggested alternative, lawful strategies for addressing the leak issue, such as pursuing legal avenues to address the unauthorized disclosure of classified information. If my objections were dismissed, I would have sought guidance from legal counsel and raised my concerns to higher authorities or authorities responsible for oversight within the administration.
