If I were in Egil "Bud" Krogh's position during the meeting where the break-in at the psychiatrist's office was proposed and approved, I would have raised concerns about the legality and morality of the operation. I would have pointed out that engaging in illegal activities, such as breaking into someone's office without lawful authorization, is not only unethical but also could have serious legal repercussions for everyone involved.

I would have recommended exploring alternative ways to address the issue without resorting to illegal actions, such as seeking legal remedies through appropriate channels. Additionally, I would have emphasized the importance of upholding the rule of law and respecting the rights of individuals, even in the context of national security concerns.

By raising these ethical and legal considerations during the meeting, I would have aimed to prevent the unlawful break-in from taking place and to ensure that any actions taken by the administration were conducted in a manner consistent with legal and ethical standards.
