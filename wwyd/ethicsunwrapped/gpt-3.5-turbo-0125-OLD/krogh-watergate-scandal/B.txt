If I were in Egil "Bud" Krogh's position at the time, given the context provided, I would have taken the following specific actions:

1. **Question the Legality and Morality**: During the meeting where the break-in was proposed, I would have raised concerns about the legality and morality of the operation. I would have pointed out that engaging in illegal activities, such as breaking into a psychiatrist's office, is not only unethical but also goes against the law.

2. **Seek Legal Advice**: I would have sought legal counsel to clarify the legality of the proposed operation. Consulting with legal experts would have provided me with a clearer understanding of the potential legal ramifications and risks involved in carrying out such actions.

3. **Refuse to Proceed**: If the legal counsel confirmed that the proposed break-in was illegal, I would have refused to proceed with the operation. I would have made it clear to my superiors that I could not participate in activities that violated the law and compromised moral principles.

4. **Report the Situation**: I would have reported the situation to the appropriate authorities or individuals within the administration who could address the issue. By escalating the matter to higher authorities, I would have sought guidance on handling the unethical request and potentially preventing the illegal operation from taking place.

5. **Protect Whistleblowers**: Given the gravity of the situation and the importance of upholding ethical standards, I would have taken steps to protect whistleblowers like Daniel Ellsberg, who exposed information in the public interest. I would have recognized the importance of transparency and accountability in government actions.

By taking these specific actions, I would have aimed to uphold legal and ethical standards, prevent unlawful activities, and prioritize integrity and public service over personal interests or loyalty to superiors.
