I would advocate for a thorough review of the case by an independent investigative body to examine the actions of the police, prosecutors, and other officials involved in the wrongful conviction of the Central Park 5. This review should aim to determine the reasons for the false confessions, the mishandling of evidence, and the failures of the criminal justice system that led to the wrongful incarceration of these young men. Additionally, I would support efforts to hold those responsible for the miscarriage of justice fully accountable and to implement reforms to prevent similar injustices from occurring in the future.
