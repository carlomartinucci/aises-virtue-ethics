I would work towards educating the public and key individuals involved in the case about the concept of false confessions and the importance of DNA evidence in criminal investigations. I would collaborate with innocence projects and advocacy organizations to raise awareness through media campaigns, community outreach events, and educational initiatives. Additionally, I would seek opportunities to engage with lawmakers to advocate for policy changes that prioritize evidence-based approaches in criminal justice systems to prevent such injustices from happening in the future.
