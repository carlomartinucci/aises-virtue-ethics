As an Assistant District Attorney (ADA), I would review the case of the Central Park 5 in light of the new evidence provided by Matias Reyes' confession and the DNA match. I would conduct a thorough reevaluation of the entire investigation and trial proceedings to determine the validity of the convictions and whether a miscarriage of justice had indeed occurred. This would involve examining the original confessions, the lack of physical evidence linking the young men to the crime, the inconsistencies between the confessions and the crime scene evidence, as well as any potential misconduct during the interrogations.

Based on this review, I would work towards exonerating the Central Park 5 by filing a motion to vacate their convictions and seeking their immediate release from prison. I would also advocate for the acknowledgment of their innocence and support their efforts to seek compensation for the years of wrongful incarceration.

Additionally, I would address any statements made by individuals, such as the lead prosecutor, the head detective, and others who have refused to accept the new evidence of innocence. I would engage in discussions with them to present the facts of the case and the irrefutable DNA evidence linking Reyes to the crime, in the hopes of fostering understanding and correcting any misconceptions that may still exist regarding the wrongful convictions of the Central Park 5.
