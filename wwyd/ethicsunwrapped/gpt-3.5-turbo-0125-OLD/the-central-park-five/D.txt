Given the circumstances, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Advocate for the full exoneration of the Central Park 5 by bringing attention to the overwhelming evidence of their innocence, including the absence of any physical evidence linking them to the crime and the DNA match from the actual perpetrator, Matias Reyes.

2. Engage with legal experts, advocacy groups, and the innocence project to push for a formal declaration of innocence for the wrongly convicted men and to ensure they receive proper compensation and support after their wrongful incarceration.

3. Challenge and confront public figures, such as Donald Trump, who continue to perpetuate false narratives about the case, by sharing the verified facts and evidence that conclusively demonstrate the innocence of the Central Park 5.

4. Work to raise awareness about the dangers of false confessions and the need for reforms in the criminal justice system to prevent similar miscarriages of justice from occurring in the future.

5. Offer support and resources to the Central Park 5 and other wrongfully convicted individuals to help them rebuild their lives and seek justice for the injustices they have faced.
