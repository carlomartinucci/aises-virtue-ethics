I would begin by acknowledging the harms caused by the article and the way in which it was handled in regards to Dr. Essay Anne Vanderbilt. I would conduct a thorough internal review to understand where the ethical lapses occurred, such as the decision to out Vanderbilt as transgender without her consent. I would ensure that all staff members receive comprehensive training on trans issues and privacy considerations. Additionally, I would issue a public apology to Vanderbilt's family and the transgender community for the harm caused by the article.

To prevent similar incidents in the future, I would establish clear editorial guidelines regarding sensitive personal information, especially related to gender identity and marginalized communities. These guidelines would prioritize compassion, privacy, and the well-being of subjects above all else. I would also implement a stronger fact-checking process to verify all information before publication and ensure that any agreements made with subjects regarding the scope of reporting are strictly followed.

In order to make amends for the harm done to Dr. Vanderbilt and her memory, I would offer support to relevant organizations that advocate for transgender rights and mental health awareness. This could include fundraising efforts, public education campaigns, or collaborations with experts in the field to promote greater understanding and sensitivity towards transgender individuals in journalism and beyond.
