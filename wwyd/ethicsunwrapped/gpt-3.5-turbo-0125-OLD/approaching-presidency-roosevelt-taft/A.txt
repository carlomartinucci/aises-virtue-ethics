In this scenario, if I were a senior advisor to the President, I would recommend instituting a formal policy review process within the administration to assess the legality and constitutionality of proposed actions. This process would involve legal experts, constitutional scholars, and policymakers to conduct thorough evaluations of the proposed initiatives before they are implemented. The goal would be to ensure that all presidential actions align with the Constitution and existing laws, reducing the risk of legal challenges or accusations of overreach.

Additionally, I would advise the President to engage in dialogue with Congress and seek their input on major policy decisions, fostering a spirit of cooperation and collaboration between the executive and legislative branches. By keeping lawmakers informed and involved in the decision-making process, we can mitigate conflicts arising from differing interpretations of executive powers.

Furthermore, I would recommend establishing clear guidelines for differentiating between "good" and "bad" trusts or monopolies, ensuring that any actions taken against corporations are based on objective criteria rather than personal views or gentleman's agreements. This would help uphold transparency and accountability in antitrust enforcement, preventing accusations of favoritism or arbitrary decision-making.

Overall, my strategy would focus on promoting transparency, legal compliance, and collaboration with other branches of government to navigate the complexities of executive power and avoid potential conflicts like those experienced between Roosevelt and Taft.
