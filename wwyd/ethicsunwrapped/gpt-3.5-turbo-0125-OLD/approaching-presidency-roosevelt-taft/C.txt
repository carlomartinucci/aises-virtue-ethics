In the context provided, if I were a member of Theodore Roosevelt's administration during his presidency, I would first seek to understand his perspective on the specific issue at hand, such as the establishment of national parks or the Panama Canal situation. I would then present him with a detailed analysis of the potential legal and constitutional implications of the proposed actions, highlighting any areas where his proposed actions may conflict with existing laws or the Constitution.

Additionally, I would offer practical suggestions for how Roosevelt's objectives could be achieved within the boundaries of the law to avoid potential conflicts with Congress or the judiciary. This might involve proposing legislative initiatives to provide a stronger legal basis for his actions or seeking input from legal experts to ensure that his decisions are legally sound.

Furthermore, I would advise Roosevelt on the potential political ramifications of his actions, emphasizing the importance of maintaining public and congressional support for his policies. By providing a balanced perspective that considers both the ethical considerations that Roosevelt valued and the legal constraints he faced, I would aim to help him make informed decisions that align with his goals while respecting the rule of law.
