I would reach out to members of the Native American community, particularly those from the Kiowa tribe like Summer Morgan, to listen to their perspectives and understand their concerns regarding Christina Fallin's actions. I would offer to facilitate a dialogue between Fallin, Pink Pony, and members of the Native American community to address the issue and work towards a resolution that respects and honors Native American cultures. Additionally, I would encourage Fallin and her band to engage in cultural sensitivity training to better understand the significance of traditional Native American regalia and artifacts.
