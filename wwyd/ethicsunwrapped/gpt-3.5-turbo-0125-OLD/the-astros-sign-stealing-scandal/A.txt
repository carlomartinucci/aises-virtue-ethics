I would recommend that MLB conduct a thorough review of its current rules and regulations surrounding electronic sign-stealing to ensure that they are clear, concise, and enforceable. Additionally, MLB should enhance surveillance measures in stadiums to detect any unauthorized use of electronic devices for sign-stealing purposes. Finally, MLB should collaborate with teams to establish stricter protocols and penalties for violating sign-stealing rules, with a focus on holding all parties involved accountable, including players, coaches, and management.
