I would take the following actions to address the sign-stealing scandal involving the Houston Astros:

1. Conduct a thorough investigation to identify all individuals involved in the sign-stealing scheme, including players, coaching staff, and management.
2. Implement robust measures to prevent future sign-stealing incidents, such as enhanced monitoring of in-game activities and stricter enforcement of MLB rules.
3. Issue appropriate penalties to all individuals found to have participated in the scheme, ensuring accountability at all levels within the organization.
4. Collaborate closely with other teams and MLB officials to rebuild trust and integrity within the sport, demonstrating a commitment to fair play and ethical conduct.
5. Communicate openly and transparently with fans, sponsors, and other stakeholders about the actions taken in response to the scandal, acknowledging the impact on the reputation of the team and the league.
6. Continuously review and improve the organization's compliance processes and ethical standards to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
7. Provide support and resources to any individuals affected by the fallout of the scandal, such as players who may face backlash from fans or media scrutiny.
