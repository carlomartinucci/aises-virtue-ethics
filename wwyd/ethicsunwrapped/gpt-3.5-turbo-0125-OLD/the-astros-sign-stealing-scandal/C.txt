Given the scenario described, one concrete action that can be taken is to strictly enforce the MLB rules regarding sign-stealing and the use of electronic devices to decode signs. This includes conducting thorough investigations into any suspicions or allegations of cheating by teams or players and meting out appropriate disciplinary measures as outlined in the league's regulations. Additionally, implementing stronger protocols and monitoring systems to prevent future sign-stealing incidents can help maintain the integrity of the game of baseball and uphold fair competition among teams.
