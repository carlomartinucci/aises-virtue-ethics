I would personally report the details of the Astros sign-stealing scandal, including the involvement of players, coaches, and management, to the appropriate authorities in MLB. This would ensure that a thorough investigation is conducted and appropriate consequences are meted out in accordance with MLB's rules and regulations. Additionally, I would cooperate fully with any inquiries or investigations to provide all relevant information and evidence to assist in uncovering the truth and upholding the integrity of the sport.
