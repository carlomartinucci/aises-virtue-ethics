I would first acknowledge and empathize with the pain and frustrations expressed by the students at both the University of Missouri and Yale University. I would work to actively listen to their concerns and engage in open dialogue with them to better understand their perspectives and experiences.

Given the specific incidents mentioned, I would take the following concrete actions:

1. At Yale University, I would address the situation involving Erika Christakis and the students by facilitating a mediated conversation between the Christakis couple and the student groups. This would provide a platform for all parties to express their viewpoints, seek mutual understanding, and work towards finding common ground.

2. At the University of Missouri, I would prioritize swift and effective responses to incidents of racial tensions on campus. I would engage with student leaders, including Jonathan Butler, to address their grievances and concerns, ensuring that their voices are heard and respected within the university administration.

3. With regards to the student protesters attempting to keep news media out at the University of Missouri, I would educate both students and journalists on the importance of freedom of speech and the role of media in documenting events. I would facilitate discussions to foster mutual respect between the press and protesters, emphasizing the significance of transparency and accountability in reporting.

Overall, I would approach these situations with a commitment to fostering dialogue, understanding, and inclusive solutions that promote a safe and supportive campus environment for all students.
