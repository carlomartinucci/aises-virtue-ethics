In response to the scenario, I would take the following actions:

1. Listen actively to the concerns and experiences shared by the students of color at both the University of Missouri and Yale University to understand their perspectives and the specific challenges they are facing on campus.
2. Engage in dialogues with both the student protesters and university administrators to facilitate constructive discussions aimed at addressing the underlying issues of racial discrimination and creating a safer and more inclusive campus environment.
3. Advocate for immediate and tangible measures to address racial tensions, such as increasing diversity and inclusion efforts, implementing anti-racism training for faculty and staff, and establishing clear protocols for responding to incidents of racial abuse and discrimination.
4. Acknowledge the importance of free speech rights while also emphasizing the need for respectful dialogue and understanding between different viewpoints to foster a campus climate that is supportive and inclusive for all students.
5. Collaborate with relevant stakeholders, including student leaders, faculty, staff, and community members, to develop comprehensive action plans that promote racial equality, social justice, and a sense of belonging for marginalized students.
