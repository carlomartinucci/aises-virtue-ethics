At Yale University, as an administrator, I would engage in open dialogue with both students and faculty members involved in the protests to understand their perspectives and concerns. I would create a platform for constructive discussions to address the underlying issues of racial insensitivity and discrimination on campus. Additionally, I would work towards implementing educational programs and initiatives to promote cultural awareness and sensitivity among the university community. By fostering understanding and respect among all members of the campus, I aim to create a more inclusive and supportive environment for students of color.
