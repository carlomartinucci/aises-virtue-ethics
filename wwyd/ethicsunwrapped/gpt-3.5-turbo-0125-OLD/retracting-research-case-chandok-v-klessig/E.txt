I would suggest that the Boyce Thompson Institute's leadership team and relevant stakeholders convene a meeting to discuss the case, engage in a comprehensive review of the situation, and develop a formal internal policy or protocol for handling similar cases of contested research findings in the future. This policy should outline clear steps to follow, such as re-investigation procedures, communication protocols among team members and authors, and collaboration with journals.

Additionally, I would recommend setting up a workshop or training session for all researchers and staff at BTI to ensure they understand the importance of research integrity, the responsibilities of co-authors in collaborative research, and the potential consequences of disputed research findings. This training should focus on maintaining high standards of scientific rigor, promoting open communication among team members, and emphasizing the significance of reproducibility in research.

Furthermore, I would advise reaching out to external experts in research ethics and scientific integrity to provide guidance and insights on best practices for handling similar situations in the future. Collaborating with professionals in the field can offer valuable perspectives and help BTI establish a strong ethical framework to prevent and address issues related to scientific misconduct effectively.

Lastly, I would suggest promoting transparency and accountability within the organization by encouraging a culture of openness and constructive feedback. By fostering an environment where concerns can be raised and addressed promptly, BTI can uphold its commitment to scientific excellence and integrity.
