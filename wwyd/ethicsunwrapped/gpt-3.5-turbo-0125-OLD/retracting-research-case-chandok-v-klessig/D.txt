I would acknowledge the Court of Appeals' ruling that Klessig's statements were legally protected because he had a legal and moral obligation to notify the journal about the issue with the results. I would recognize that the court found no evidence of malice towards Chandok, and that the attempts to have Chandok replicate her work were appropriate actions in light of the situation. I would also take note of the court's emphasis on the shared common interest between the communicants involved in the case.
