Given the scenario, I would closely monitor the situation in Liberia to determine the most appropriate course of action. This would involve consulting with experts in global health and humanitarian aid to understand the specific needs on the ground. Additionally, I would work with other countries and international organizations involved in the relief efforts to coordinate a comprehensive response that maximizes resources and expertise.

I would also prioritize transparency in decision-making and communication with the public, providing regular updates on the progress of the relief efforts and any challenges encountered. This would help build trust and support for the intervention, both domestically and internationally.

Furthermore, I would ensure that the military personnel deployed to Liberia are trained not only in providing medical assistance but also in understanding and respecting cultural norms and sensitivities in the local community. This would help mitigate any potential tensions or misunderstandings that may arise during the relief efforts.

Overall, my actions would be guided by the goal of effectively addressing the humanitarian crisis in Liberia while minimizing any potential negative consequences of military intervention.
