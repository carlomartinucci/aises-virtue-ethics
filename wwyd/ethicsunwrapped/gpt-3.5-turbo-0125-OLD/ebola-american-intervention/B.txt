In response to the situation, I would focus on supporting and coordinating with local health authorities and organizations in Liberia to ensure effective management and containment of the Ebola epidemic. Specifically, I would work on:

1. Collaborating with local health authorities to understand the specific needs and challenges faced in Liberia, such as shortage of medical supplies, healthcare infrastructure, and healthcare workers.

2. Providing financial and logistical support to strengthen the healthcare system in Liberia, including building additional treatment centers, providing medical supplies and equipment, and training local healthcare workers on Ebola treatment and prevention.

3. Facilitating international collaboration and coordination among various organizations and countries involved in the relief efforts to ensure a unified and efficient response to the epidemic in Liberia.

4. Conducting public health campaigns to raise awareness about Ebola transmission, prevention, and treatment in Liberia, in collaboration with local health authorities and community leaders.

5. Monitoring and evaluating the impact of the relief efforts to ensure that resources are effectively utilized and that the response is having a meaningful impact on controlling the spread of Ebola in Liberia.
