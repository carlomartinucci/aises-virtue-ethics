I would evaluate the effectiveness of the American military intervention in Liberia by analyzing the available data on the number of Ebola cases treated in the treatment centers built by the military. Next, I would examine the impact of the military intervention on the overall trend of new Ebola cases in Liberia to determine the extent to which the intervention contributed to bringing the epidemic under control. Based on this analysis, I would provide recommendations on potential areas for improvement in future responses to global health crises to ensure more efficient and effective interventions.
