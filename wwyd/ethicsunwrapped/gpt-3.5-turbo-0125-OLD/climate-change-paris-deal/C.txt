In the context of the Paris climate agreement and the ethical dilemmas surrounding climate change, I would prioritize action by working to increase public awareness and advocacy for more ambitious climate action. Specifically, I would collaborate with environmental organizations, educational institutions, and grassroots movements to organize campaigns, workshops, and events aimed at informing the public about the urgency of the climate crisis and the inadequacies of the current voluntary targets set in the Paris agreement. By engaging with and mobilizing communities, we can foster a sense of collective responsibility and push for stronger measures to mitigate climate change, encouraging governments and policymakers to raise their ambitions and commit to more effective emissions reductions strategies.
