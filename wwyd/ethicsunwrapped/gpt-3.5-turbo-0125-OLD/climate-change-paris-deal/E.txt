I would advocate for increased transparency and accountability regarding the implementation of the Paris climate agreement. This could involve establishing an independent body tasked with monitoring and reporting on each nation's progress towards meeting their emissions reduction targets. The reports generated by this body would be made publicly available to hold countries accountable for their commitments and to facilitate greater international cooperation and peer pressure to ensure that nations adhere to the goals of the agreement. Additionally, I would work towards creating mechanisms for aiding developing countries in their efforts to transition to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, as well as providing support for adaptation measures to address the impacts of climate change that are already being felt. By focusing on transparency, accountability, and support for developing countries, we can help address some of the ethical dilemmas inherent in the global response to climate change.
