I would research in more detail the specific cases of unethical practices in Apple's supply chain, such as the dangerous conditions in tin mines in Indonesia. This would involve studying reports from organizations like the BBC and other investigative bodies, as well as reaching out to experts in the field for their insights. By gaining a deeper understanding of the specific challenges faced by workers in these mines, I could better assess the urgency and impact of the situation. This information would then inform my recommendations on potential actions to take, such as advocating for improved working conditions, supporting ethical sourcing initiatives, or collaborating with Apple to ensure that their supply chain becomes more socially responsible.
