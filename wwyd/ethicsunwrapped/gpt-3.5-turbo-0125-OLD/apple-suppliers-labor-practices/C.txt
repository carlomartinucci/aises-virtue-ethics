I would analyze the annual reports released by Apple detailing their work with suppliers and labor practices to understand the extent of improvements made in the working conditions of suppliers. I would also review any specific actions and initiatives Apple has taken to address worker safety and environmental concerns in their supply chain. Additionally, I would research the current status of the tin mining industry in Indonesia to better understand the challenges and potential solutions to improve working conditions. Based on this information, I would consider engaging with Apple's corporate responsibility team to discuss potential ways to further enhance the monitoring and regulation of component sources, with a focus on improving safety and environmental standards in the supply chain.
