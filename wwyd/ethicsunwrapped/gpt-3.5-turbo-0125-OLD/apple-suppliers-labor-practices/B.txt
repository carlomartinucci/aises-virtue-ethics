I would conduct a thorough review of Apple's annual reports on their supplier and labor practices to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current situation. I would pay particular attention to any evidence of improvements made in the working conditions of the suppliers. After analyzing the reports, I would reach out to Apple directly to express concerns about the unethical practices observed in sourcing tin from Indonesia and the risks faced by workers, particularly children.

I would inquire about the specific actions Apple is taking to address and mitigate the dangers faced by workers in tin mines, and request detailed information on the measures implemented to ensure ethical sourcing practices. I would emphasize the importance of transparency and accountability in the supply chain and seek assurances that Apple is actively working towards sustainable and responsible practices.

Additionally, I would research and identify organizations and initiatives working towards improving labor conditions in the tin mining industry in Indonesia. I would explore potential partnerships or collaborations with these groups to support the implementation of ethical sourcing practices and advocate for the well-being of workers in the supply chain. Ultimately, I would strive to engage Apple in meaningful dialogue and action towards creating positive change in the sourcing practices of critical components like tin.
