I would conduct a thorough investigation into Apple's supply chain practices, specifically focusing on the tin sourced from Indonesia. This investigation would involve gathering information from various sources, including reports from independent auditors, interviews with workers, and data on the conditions at the mines. I would also review Apple's own annual reports on supplier practices to understand the extent of their monitoring and efforts to improve conditions.

Based on the findings of my investigation, I would work to identify the specific mines and suppliers involved in the unethical sourcing of tin. I would then present this information to Apple's management, urging them to take immediate action to address the issues at these mines. This could involve implementing new monitoring and auditing processes, setting up training programs for workers, or even considering alternative sources for tin.

Furthermore, I would engage with relevant stakeholders, such as non-profit organizations and advocacy groups, to discuss potential solutions and gather input on how Apple can make a meaningful impact in improving the working conditions in the tin mines. By collaborating with external partners, we can develop a comprehensive plan to address the ethical concerns related to Apple's supply chain practices and work towards sustainable solutions that benefit the workers and the environment.
