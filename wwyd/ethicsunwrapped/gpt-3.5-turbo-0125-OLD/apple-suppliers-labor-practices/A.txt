In this scenario, I would conduct thorough research to understand the specific conditions in the Indonesian mines where Apple sources its tin, including the extent of child labor, safety hazards, and environmental impact. I would then work to establish direct communication with Apple's responsible supply chain managers to address these concerns. During these discussions, I would emphasize the importance of prioritizing the well-being of workers and environmental sustainability in their supply chain operations, and I would push for concrete steps to be taken to improve conditions in the Indonesian mines. Additionally, I would collaborate with relevant advocacy groups and NGOs experienced in labor rights and environmental protection to leverage their expertise and resources in advocating for change within Apple's supply chain. Lastly, I would recommend that Apple consider investing in the development of ethical tin sourcing initiatives in Indonesia to support local communities and improve working conditions in the mines.
