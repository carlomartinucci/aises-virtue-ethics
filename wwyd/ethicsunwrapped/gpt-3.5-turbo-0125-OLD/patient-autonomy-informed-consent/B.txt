I would convene a meeting with the hospital staff involved in the patient's care to discuss the ethical concerns about deceiving the patient, even with the informed consent from the guardian. During this meeting, we would thoroughly explore alternative approaches to administering the new drug, considering the patient's autonomy and right to make decisions about their own care, even if currently deemed incompetent. We would also review the legal implications of administering medication without the patient's knowledge and consent, even with guardian approval. This meeting would aim to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the ethical issues at play and to make a collective, informed decision on the best course of action in this complex situation.
