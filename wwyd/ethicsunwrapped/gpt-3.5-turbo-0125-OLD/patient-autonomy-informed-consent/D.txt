To address the situation, I would hold a meeting involving the patient's treatment team, including physicians, nurses, social workers, and ethicists, to thoroughly discuss the ethical implications of administering the medication covertly. During this discussion, I would ensure that all viewpoints are heard and considered.

Next, I would prioritize seeking a second opinion from an independent psychiatrist or mental health professional who is not directly involved in the patient's care, to evaluate the necessity of the new medication and the feasibility of alternative treatment approaches.

Following the additional evaluation and discussion, if it is determined that the new medication is indeed the best option for the patient's well-being and recovery, I would engage in an open dialogue with the patient's son to explore alternative ways of administering the medication that are respectful of the patient's autonomy and preferences. This could include educating the patient about the benefits of the medication in a way that is sensitive to his fears of being poisoned.

Ultimately, the goal would be to find a solution that prioritizes the patient's right to self-determination while also taking into account the medical necessity of the treatment. If after thorough consideration it is still deemed necessary to administer the medication covertly, I would provide full transparency to the patient's son, explaining the rationale and ethical considerations behind the decision.
