I would conduct research to gather data and information on the potential impacts of prohibiting abortions based solely on a diagnosis of Down Syndrome. This would involve reviewing medical studies, consulting with healthcare professionals and disability rights advocates, and analyzing case studies from states or countries that have implemented similar legislation. By gathering comprehensive information, I would be better equipped to understand the implications of such laws and provide informed insights to stakeholders involved in the debate.
