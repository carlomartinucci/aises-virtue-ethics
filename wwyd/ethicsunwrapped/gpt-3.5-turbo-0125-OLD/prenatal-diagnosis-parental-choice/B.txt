I would facilitate a meeting between representatives from the pro-life organizations and representatives from organizations supporting reproductive rights, such as NARAL Pro-Choice America and Planned Parenthood. During the meeting, I would encourage open and respectful dialogue to discuss the concerns and perspectives of both sides regarding the "Protecting Individuals with Down Syndrome Act." I would emphasize the importance of listening to each other's viewpoints and finding common ground, if possible, to address the complex ethical and legal issues surrounding prenatal testing and abortion in cases involving Down Syndrome. Furthermore, I would suggest exploring potential compromises or alternative solutions that could address the interests and values of both sides while upholding the rights and dignity of individuals with disabilities.
