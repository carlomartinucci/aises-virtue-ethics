I would review the specific details and implications of the "Protecting Individuals with Down Syndrome Act" proposed by the pro-life organizations in early 2023. I would research the arguments put forth both in support and opposition to the act, including the perspectives of individuals and organizations like NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio and Ohio Right to Life. Additionally, I would seek to understand the potential impact of such legislation on pregnant individuals, families, and individuals with Down syndrome. Finally, I would consider consulting with medical professionals and legal experts to gather insights on the enforceability and implications of the proposed act in practice.
