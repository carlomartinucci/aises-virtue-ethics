In this scenario, I would advise Rashard Mendenhall to clarify his original tweets by explaining the intention behind them in a follow-up post. Specifically, he could elaborate on his stance regarding celebrating death, providing more context to help the audience understand his perspective better. By addressing the issue head-on and offering additional insights into his thought process, Mendenhall can potentially mitigate some of the backlash he has been facing and foster a more constructive dialogue around the topic.
