I would ensure that all Paralympic athletes under my responsibility are thoroughly educated on the IPC's classification system and the ethical guidelines that must be followed. I would make it a priority to discuss and emphasize the importance of fair play, integrity, and honesty in sports with the athletes. Additionally, I would closely monitor their behaviors to ensure they are not engaging in any form of cheating or manipulating their disability status to gain an unfair advantage. If I were to suspect any violations of the classification rules, I would report my concerns to the relevant authorities for further investigation and appropriate action. Furthermore, I would encourage transparency and open communication within the team to foster a culture of accountability and adherence to ethical standards in Paralympic sports.
