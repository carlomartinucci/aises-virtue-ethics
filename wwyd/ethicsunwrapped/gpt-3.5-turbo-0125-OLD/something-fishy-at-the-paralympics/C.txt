In this scenario, I would proactively work with the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) to create and implement stricter measures to prevent classification cheating among Paralympic athletes. This could involve:

1. Collaborating with the IPC to develop enhanced classification protocols that include more thorough assessments and checks to verify the accuracy of athletes' declared impairments.
2. Implementing surprise checks and audits during competitions to ensure athletes are competing within their appropriate classification.
3. Providing education and training sessions for athletes, coaches, and support staff on the importance of fair play, integrity, and the consequences of cheating the classification system.
4. Encouraging athletes to report any suspicions or concerns they have regarding the classification of their competitors, creating a culture of transparency and accountability within the Paralympic community.
5. Enforcing strict penalties, such as disqualification or suspension, for athletes found guilty of cheating the classification system, to deter others from engaging in similar misconduct.

By taking these specific actions, we can uphold the integrity of Paralympic sports and ensure fair competition for all athletes involved.
