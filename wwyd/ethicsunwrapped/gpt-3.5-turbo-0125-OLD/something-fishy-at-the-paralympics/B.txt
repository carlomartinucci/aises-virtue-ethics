I would work with the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and other relevant stakeholders to enhance the classification system's robustness and implement stricter monitoring procedures to detect and deter cheating among Paralympians. This may involve collaborating with experts in the field of disability classification, conducting regular audits of classification processes, increasing surveillance during classification events, and imposing severe penalties for those found guilty of manipulating their disability status for competitive advantage. Additionally, I would advocate for increased education and awareness programs for athletes, coaches, and staff on the importance of integrity in sports and the consequences of cheating in Paralympic competition. By taking these concrete steps, we can help ensure fair play and uphold the values of honesty and equality in the Paralympic movement.
