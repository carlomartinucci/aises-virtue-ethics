I would proactively ensure that all athletes under my care are fully aware of the rules and guidelines set forth by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) regarding the classification system. I would organize a mandatory training session for all athletes, coaches, and staff to review the classification process in detail, emphasize the importance of honesty and integrity in the sport, and explain the consequences of cheating. Additionally, I would closely monitor the behavior and preparation of athletes leading up to classification events to prevent any attempts at cheating, such as closely observing any unusual behaviors or physical conditions that could indicate an athlete is trying to manipulate their classification. Finally, I would encourage an atmosphere of openness and transparency within the team so that any concerns or suspicions of cheating can be addressed promptly and appropriately.
