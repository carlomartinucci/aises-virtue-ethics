I would proactively work with the IPC and relevant sports organizations to improve and strengthen the classification process for Paralympic athletes. This may involve conducting thorough reviews of the current system, identifying potential loopholes that could be exploited for cheating, and implementing stricter measures to prevent such fraudulent behavior. I would collaborate with experts in the field of disability classification and sports ethics to develop comprehensive guidelines and protocols that ensure fair competition and maintain the integrity of the Paralympic Games. Additionally, I would advocate for increased education and awareness among athletes, coaches, and staff regarding the importance of ethical conduct and adherence to classification rules. By taking these concrete steps, we can strive to uphold the values of fairness and sportsmanship within the Paralympic community.
