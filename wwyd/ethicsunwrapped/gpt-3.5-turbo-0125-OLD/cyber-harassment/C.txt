In the given scenario involving cyberbullying and social media harassment, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Offer support and counseling to the student who posted hurtful messages, acknowledging her feelings of upset and providing guidance on expressing emotions in a constructive manner.

2. Engage with the school administration to implement educational programs on digital citizenship and responsible social media use to prevent future incidents of cyberbullying.

3. Collaborate with mental health professionals to address any emotional distress experienced by both the teacher and the student involved in the incident.

4. Hold private discussions with the student and her parents to facilitate a resolution and reinforce the importance of respectful communication in both online and offline settings.

5. Facilitate dialogue between the teacher, student, and other relevant parties to promote understanding, empathy, and reconciliation in a controlled environment.

6. Review and enforce school policies on cyberbullying and harassment to ensure a safe and respectful online environment for all members of the school community.
