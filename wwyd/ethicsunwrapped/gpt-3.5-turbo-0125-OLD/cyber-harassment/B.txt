In response to the scenario, I would first ensure that the student who engaged in cyberbullying behavior is supported and guided towards understanding the consequences of her actions. I would schedule a private meeting with the student to discuss the impact of her hurtful messages, emphasizing the importance of respectful communication and empathy towards others. Collaborating with the school's counseling staff, I would facilitate a session focusing on social media etiquette and responsible online behavior for all students to raise awareness on cyberbullying prevention.

Additionally, I would address the concerns raised by those who felt that the teacher's actions went too far by confronting the student in the classroom and posting the video online. I would have a discussion with the teacher about the impact of her actions on the student and reflect on alternative ways to address cyberbullying incidents while upholding the privacy and rights of the individuals involved. It would be essential to ensure that fair and respectful protocols are followed when addressing such issues in the future, considering the well-being and rights of all parties involved.
