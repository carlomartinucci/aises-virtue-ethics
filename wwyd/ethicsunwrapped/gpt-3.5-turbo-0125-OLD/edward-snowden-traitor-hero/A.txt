In this scenario, to address the dilemma of Edward Snowden's actions, I would establish a comprehensive and impartial panel comprised of legal experts, ethicists, government officials, and representatives from civil society organizations. The panel would be tasked with conducting a thorough investigation into the impacts of Snowden's disclosures on national security, individual privacy rights, and public accountability. The panel would review all relevant documents and information related to the case, and interview stakeholders to gather diverse perspectives.

Following the investigation, the panel would issue a detailed report outlining its findings and conclusions regarding the ethical and legal implications of Snowden's actions. The report would aim to provide a nuanced analysis of the situation, considering the conflicting perspectives presented by various parties involved. It would also include recommendations on how similar situations could be handled in the future to balance the principles of transparency, national security, and individual rights.

Furthermore, I would ensure that the panel's proceedings are transparent and accessible to the public, emphasizing the importance of accountability and open discourse in addressing complex ethical dilemmas. The report would be published online and shared with relevant stakeholders, including government agencies, civil society organizations, and the media, to promote a constructive dialogue on the intersection of ethics, law, and security in the digital age.
