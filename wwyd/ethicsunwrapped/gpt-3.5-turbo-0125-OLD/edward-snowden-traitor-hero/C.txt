I would consider the differing perspectives on Edward Snowden's actions and the principles at play. I would review the specific legal guidelines and obligations in place related to handling classified information and whistleblowing. Additionally, I would assess the potential impact of his actions on national security and individual privacy rights. I would then gather relevant information on the specific nature of the leaked documents and whether his actions were in the public interest. Finally, I would assess the ethical and legal implications of the situation while considering the potential consequences of supporting or condemning Snowden's actions.
