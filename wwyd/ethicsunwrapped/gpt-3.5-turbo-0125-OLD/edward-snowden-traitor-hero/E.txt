In the given scenario, if I were to act, I would consider the following specific actions:

1. Advocate for transparency and oversight: I would work towards pushing for increased transparency and oversight in government surveillance programs to ensure that citizens' rights to privacy are protected while still maintaining national security.

2. Support legal reforms: I would advocate for legal reforms that provide clearer guidelines for whistleblowers to follow when exposing government wrongdoing, to ensure that such revelations can be made in a way that minimizes harm to national security.

3. Offer support for Snowden: I would work to provide legal and moral support for Edward Snowden, highlighting the importance of his actions in revealing the extent of government surveillance and sparking a necessary public debate on privacy rights.

4. Engage in dialogues on ethics and legality: I would participate in discussions and debates surrounding the ethics and legality of Snowden's actions to contribute to a better understanding of the complexities involved in balancing national security concerns with individual rights to privacy.

5. Advocate for whistleblower protections: I would support efforts to implement stronger whistleblower protections to encourage individuals to come forward with evidence of misconduct or violations of rights within government agencies without fear of retaliation.
