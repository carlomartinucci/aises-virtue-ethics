If I were a part of this scenario, I would work towards finding a middle ground between Snowden's actions and the government's response. I would advocate for a comprehensive review of the government surveillance programs to ensure they are conducted in accordance with the law and respect individuals' privacy rights. I would also support legislative reforms to increase transparency and oversight of intelligence activities to prevent future abuses while upholding national security interests. Additionally, I would encourage constructive dialogue between the government, whistleblowers, and civil society to address concerns and promote accountability in a manner that serves the public interest.
