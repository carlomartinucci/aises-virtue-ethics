If I were faced with the situation of Edward Snowden releasing confidential government documents, I would first strive to carefully analyze the content of the leaked documents to assess the potential risks posed to national security. Following that, I would consult with legal experts and superiors to understand the full implications of the actions, ensuring that a thorough investigation is conducted to determine the impact of the disclosed information. Finally, I would support a balanced and just decision-making process that considers both the legality of Snowden's actions as well as the broader ethical considerations surrounding government accountability and citizens' rights to privacy.
