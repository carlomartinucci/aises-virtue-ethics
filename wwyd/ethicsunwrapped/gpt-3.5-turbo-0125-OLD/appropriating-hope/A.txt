Given the scenario, I would first thoroughly research and understand the legal aspects of copyright law, fair use, and artistic appropriation to gain a clear understanding of the issues at hand. This would involve studying relevant court cases, legal precedents, and expert opinions on the matter. 

Next, I would consult with legal experts specializing in intellectual property law to get their advice on the specific case involving Shepard Fairey and the Associated Press. I would seek guidance on the best course of action to ensure that any artistic appropriation I engage in complies with the law and respects the rights of original creators.

Furthermore, I would engage in open communication and negotiation with the original creators or copyright holders of any images or objects I intend to appropriate for my artwork. It is crucial to establish a dialogue, seek permission if necessary, and discuss potential issues such as credit, compensation, and shared rights to avoid legal disputes in the future.

Lastly, I would document all interactions, agreements, and permissions in writing to ensure clarity and transparency in case any disputes arise later on. This documentation would serve as legal protection and help prevent misunderstandings or conflicts regarding artistic appropriation and copyright issues.
