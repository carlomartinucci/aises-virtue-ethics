I would recommend that Shepard Fairey, in the future, work closely with legal experts to confirm the copyright status of any images he wishes to appropriate for his artwork. This would involve conducting thorough research on the copyright ownership of the images and obtaining explicit permission when necessary to ensure compliance with copyright laws and avoid any future legal issues. By taking these proactive steps, Fairey can mitigate the risk of potential copyright infringement claims and maintain positive relationships with copyright holders. Additionally, he should consider reaching out to photographers directly to discuss the use of their images and potentially collaborate on new projects with their consent.
