Given the scenario, if I were in a similar situation, I would ensure clear communication and transparency from the beginning when using someone else's work as a reference for my own artistic creation. Specifically, I would proactively reach out to the original photographer to discuss my intentions, seek permission to use the image, properly credit the photographer in the final artwork, and negotiate any compensation if necessary. This direct engagement and collaboration would help establish a mutually beneficial relationship and prevent potential legal disputes or misunderstandings later on.
