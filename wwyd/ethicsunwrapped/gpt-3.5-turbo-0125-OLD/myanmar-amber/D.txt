I would initiate a dialogue and collaboration between paleontologists, collectors, relevant stakeholders, and local communities to develop a comprehensive ethical framework for the responsible sourcing and study of Myanmar's amber fossils. This framework should include guidelines for ethical collection practices, transparent supply chains, and fair labor standards. By engaging all parties in the discussion, we can work towards a sustainable solution that respects both scientific integrity and human rights concerns. Additionally, I would advocate for increased awareness among consumers and the scientific community about the ethical implications of purchasing these fossils, encouraging informed decision-making that prioritizes ethical sourcing practices.
