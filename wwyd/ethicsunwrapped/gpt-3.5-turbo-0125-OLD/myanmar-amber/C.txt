I would prioritize conducting thorough due diligence to trace the origins of any amber fossils I am considering acquiring. This would involve researching the specific source of the fossil, understanding the mining practices employed in that region, and verifying that the extraction did not contribute to conflict or human rights abuses. If there are any doubts about the ethical sourcing of the fossil, I would refrain from acquiring it and instead seek alternative ways to advance my research without supporting unethical practices. Additionally, I would actively engage with the scientific community to raise awareness about these ethical concerns and advocate for greater transparency and accountability in the sourcing of amber fossils from Myanmar.
