In this scenario, I would report the clerk's email admission of manipulating wait time records to higher authorities within the Veterans Administration. I would make sure to provide any evidence or documentation I have, such as the email itself, for the investigation. This action would help uncover the dishonest practices being conducted, hold those responsible accountable, and work towards ensuring that veterans receive the timely and quality healthcare they deserve.
