I would immediately report the unethical practices to the appropriate authorities within the Veterans Administration. Specifically, I would gather all evidence related to the manipulation of wait time data, such as the email from the clerk and any information regarding the use of multiple sets of records. I would then escalate the issue to higher management or the VA Inspector General, ensuring that the full extent of the unethical behaviors is investigated thoroughly. Finally, I would cooperate fully with investigators, providing any additional information or documentation that may be required to uncover the truth and hold those responsible accountable for their actions.
