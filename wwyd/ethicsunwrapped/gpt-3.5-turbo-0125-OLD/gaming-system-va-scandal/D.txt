I would immediately report the manipulative practices to the appropriate authorities within the Veterans Administration, such as higher management or the Office of Inspector General. I would provide concrete evidence of the falsified wait time reporting, including the email from the clerk admitting to gaming the system. Additionally, I would ensure that all necessary information is documented and shared with investigators to assist in the ongoing investigations. It is crucial to prioritize the well-being and timely care of the veterans by addressing these unethical practices swiftly and transparently.
