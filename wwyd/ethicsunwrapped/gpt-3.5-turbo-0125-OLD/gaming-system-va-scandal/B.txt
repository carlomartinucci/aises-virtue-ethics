In this scenario, I would first gather all the necessary evidence and documentation related to the manipulation of wait times by the clerks, administrators, and executives within the VA. This would include obtaining copies of the email where the clerk admits to gaming the system, as well as any other communications or documents that provide insight into the practices being employed to artificially reduce wait times.

Next, I would schedule a meeting with the hospital leadership, including the front office staff and executives involved in setting and enforcing the wait time reduction goals. During this meeting, I would present the evidence I have collected and express my concerns about the unethical behavior taking place. I would emphasize the negative impact these actions are having on the quality of care provided to veterans and the overall integrity of the organization.

I would work with the hospital leadership team to develop a plan to address the manipulation of wait times and ensure that veterans receive the care they need in a timely and ethical manner. This plan would likely involve revising the wait time reporting procedures, providing additional training on ethical conduct, and implementing stricter oversight and monitoring measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Finally, I would report the findings of my investigation to higher authorities within the VA and recommend disciplinary action for those involved in the manipulation of wait times. I would also advocate for transparency and accountability in addressing these issues and improving the overall functioning of the Veterans Health Administration to better serve the needs of our veterans.
