I would conduct a thorough and unbiased investigation into the welfare of the fighting bulls used in bullfighting. This would involve researching and analyzing data on the living conditions, treatment, and overall well-being of the bulls from birth until their participation in the bullfight. I would also consult with veterinary experts and animal welfare organizations to gain a comprehensive understanding of the physical and psychological impact of bullfighting on the bulls. This research would provide me with valuable insights to make informed decisions on the ethical considerations surrounding bullfighting.
