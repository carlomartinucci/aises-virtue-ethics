Given the conflicting views on bullfighting and its cultural importance, I would suggest facilitating open dialogue and debate between stakeholders, including animal rights activists, bullfighting proponents, cultural experts, and the general public. This could involve organizing forums or discussion panels where all perspectives can be shared and considered. By fostering a space for respectful conversation and sharing of information, we may be able to promote understanding and potentially find common ground or solutions that can address the concerns raised while respecting the cultural significance of bullfighting.
