I would conduct a thorough investigation into the welfare practices and conditions of the bulls raised for bullfighting. This investigation would include reviewing documentation and reports on how the bulls are raised, cared for, and transported to bullfighting events. I would also inspect the facilities where the bulls are held before the fights to ensure they are maintained in a humane manner.

Additionally, I would seek input from veterinary experts and animal welfare organizations to provide an objective assessment of the physical and psychological impact on the bulls during bullfighting events. Their expertise would help determine whether the bulls experience unnecessary suffering or harm during the fights.

Based on the findings of the investigation, I would work with relevant stakeholders, including bull breeders, bullfighters, animal rights organizations, and government authorities, to develop and implement measures to improve the welfare of the bulls involved in bullfighting. This might involve introducing stricter regulations, enhanced monitoring mechanisms, or promoting alternative practices that prioritize the well-being of the animals while respecting the cultural significance of bullfighting.
