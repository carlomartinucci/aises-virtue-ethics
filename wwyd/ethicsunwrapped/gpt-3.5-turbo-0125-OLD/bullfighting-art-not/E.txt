I would conduct a thorough and unbiased study on the welfare and treatment of the bulls used in bullfighting. This study would involve examining the living conditions, care, and treatment of the bulls before, during, and after the bullfighting events. Additionally, I would research data on the physical and psychological impact on the bulls involved in bullfighting to determine the extent of suffering they experience.

Based on the findings of the study, I would establish clear guidelines and regulations to ensure the well-being and humane treatment of the bulls in bullfighting. These regulations would aim to minimize any potential harm or suffering experienced by the bulls during these events. Additionally, I would work with relevant authorities, such as animal welfare organizations and local government officials, to enforce these regulations and ensure compliance within the bullfighting industry.

Furthermore, I would seek to promote alternative forms of entertainment or cultural events that do not involve the exploitation or harm of animals. This could include supporting initiatives that celebrate local traditions and heritage in a way that is respectful and ethical towards animals. By offering alternative cultural activities, we can help shift societal perceptions and values away from practices that raise ethical concerns.
