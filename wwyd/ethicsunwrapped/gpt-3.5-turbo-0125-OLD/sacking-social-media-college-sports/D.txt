If I were directly involved in this scenario, I would work closely with the coaching staff and athletic department to develop a comprehensive social media policy tailored to our university's values and guidelines. This policy would outline specific expectations regarding what content is acceptable for student-athletes to post on their social media accounts, emphasizing the importance of representing the university in a positive light. Additionally, I would advocate for the implementation of educational workshops or training sessions to help athletes understand the potential consequences of their social media behavior and how to use these platforms responsibly.

Furthermore, I would recommend regular monitoring of student-athletes' social media activities using tools like UDiligence to identify any inappropriate content or problematic behavior. It would be important to establish clear consequences for violating the social media policy, which could include disciplinary actions or loss of privileges. By actively managing and addressing social media use among college athletes, we can mitigate potential risks while still allowing them to benefit from the positive aspects of online communication.
