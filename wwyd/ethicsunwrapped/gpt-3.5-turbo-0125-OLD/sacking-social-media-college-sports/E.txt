As a proactive measure, I would recommend implementing a comprehensive social media education program for college athletes at the University of South Carolina. This program should include workshops or seminars focusing on responsible social media use, potential consequences of inappropriate posts, and guidelines on how to positively represent themselves and the university online. Additionally, personalized one-on-one sessions with a social media expert could be beneficial in addressing individual concerns or misconceptions regarding social media use. Regularly updating and reinforcing this education program would help athletes make informed decisions about their online presence and mitigate the risks associated with social media usage.
