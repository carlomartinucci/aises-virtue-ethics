In this scenario, I would ensure that there are robust risk management and internal control systems in place within the organization. This includes implementing checks and balances to prevent a single individual from having unchecked authority over trading activities and risk exposure. I would also establish clear reporting structures and regular monitoring of trading activities to detect any irregularities or unauthorized actions. Additionally, I would conduct thorough audits to verify the accuracy of financial records and ensure transparency in all transactions. Finally, I would provide comprehensive training to employees on ethical behavior, risk management, and the importance of reporting any concerns or suspicions of fraudulent activities.
