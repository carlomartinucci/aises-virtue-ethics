In the given scenario, I would ensure that there are robust risk management and oversight procedures in place at all levels of the organization to prevent any one individual from having unchecked authority over trading activities. I would implement regular audits of trading accounts to detect any discrepancies or unauthorized activities. I would also establish clear protocols for reporting losses or risky trading behaviors to senior management without fear of retaliation, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the organization. Additionally, I would provide adequate training and support for employees to navigate challenging situations ethically and effectively.
