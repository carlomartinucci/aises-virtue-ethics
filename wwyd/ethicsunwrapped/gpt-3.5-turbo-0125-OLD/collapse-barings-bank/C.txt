If I were in this scenario, I would ensure regular and thorough monitoring of all trading activities, especially those involving high-risk speculative trading. I would establish a system of checks and balances to prevent a single individual, like Nick Leeson, from having unchecked control over large trading positions. Additionally, I would prioritize transparency and encourage an open communication culture where any losses or issues are immediately reported and addressed without fear of repercussions. Furthermore, I would implement strict risk management protocols to prevent traders from taking excessively leveraged positions that could potentially lead to catastrophic losses like the collapse of Barings Bank.
