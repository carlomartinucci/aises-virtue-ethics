I would actively monitor the activities of all traders, including Nick Leeson, by implementing regular and thorough audits of trading positions to ensure transparency and accountability. I would also establish clear procedures for reporting losses or discrepancies immediately, without fear of retribution, in order to prevent any potential cover-ups like the one Leeson engaged in. Additionally, I would provide ongoing training and education to all staff about ethical conduct and the importance of honesty and integrity in financial dealings. By fostering a culture of transparency and accountability within the bank, it may have been possible to prevent such a catastrophic failure.
