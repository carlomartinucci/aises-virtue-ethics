In this scenario, if I were a colleague or supervisor of Nick Leeson at Barings Bank, I would take the specific action of conducting regular and thorough oversight of his trading activities. This would involve setting up a systematic process of reviewing his trades, positions, and risk exposures on a frequent basis. I would also ensure that there are multiple layers of supervision and approval required for significant trading decisions.

Furthermore, I would establish clear risk management protocols and controls to prevent one individual, like Leeson, from having unchecked authority over trading activities. I would implement regular independent audits of the trading desk to detect any discrepancies or irregularities in trading records or financial reports.

Moreover, I would encourage a culture of transparency and accountability within the organization, where employees feel comfortable reporting concerns or raising red flags about potential unethical behavior or financial irregularities. I would emphasize the importance of honesty and integrity in all dealings to mitigate the risk of catastrophic losses due to hidden or unauthorized trading activities.

By taking these specific actions, I aim to prevent a situation like the collapse of Barings Bank from occurring again in the future due to unchecked trading activities and lack of oversight.
