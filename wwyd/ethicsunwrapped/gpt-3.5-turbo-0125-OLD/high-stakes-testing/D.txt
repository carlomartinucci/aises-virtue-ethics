I would first seek to understand the specific concerns and reasons behind the opposition to high stakes testing within the community, including speaking with parents, teachers, and administrators who are against it. By listening to their perspectives and experiences, I can gain valuable insights into the impact of high stakes testing on students and the educational environment.

Next, I would collaborate with stakeholders to explore alternative assessment methods that could provide a more comprehensive and equitable evaluation of student achievement. This could involve researching and proposing alternative assessment models that focus on a student's holistic development rather than solely relying on standardized test scores.

Additionally, I would work with educators to create a balanced curriculum that integrates subjects like art, social studies, and science, ensuring that students have the opportunity to engage in a well-rounded education beyond test preparation.

Furthermore, I would advocate for policy changes at the local and state level to address the concerns raised by the community regarding high stakes testing. This may involve communicating the community's concerns to policymakers, participating in public forums, or working with advocacy groups to push for reforms that prioritize student well-being and educational excellence.

Overall, my approach would be to engage in dialogue, research alternative solutions, promote a balanced curriculum, and advocate for policy changes in collaboration with stakeholders to address the negative impacts of high stakes testing on students and the educational system.
