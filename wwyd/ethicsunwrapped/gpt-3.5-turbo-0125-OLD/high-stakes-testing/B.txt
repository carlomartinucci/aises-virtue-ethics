I would conduct a thorough review of the available research on the impact of high stakes testing on student outcomes, particularly focusing on whether standardized testing effectively reduces the achievement gap among student populations. I would analyze studies that examine the correlation between test scores and long-term academic success, as well as studies that investigate the unintended consequences of high-stakes testing, such as teaching to the test and narrowing the curriculum. Based on this evidence, I would present a comprehensive report to decision-makers in the education system, advocating for evidence-based policies that prioritize student learning and well-being while also ensuring accountability in education.
