I would recommend that Justice Scalia recuse himself from the case to avoid any appearance of bias and to uphold the integrity of the judicial process. Additionally, I would advise promoting transparency and accountability by encouraging judges to maintain a professional distance from individuals who may have a vested interest in cases before the court. This will help to preserve public confidence in the fairness and impartiality of the judiciary.
