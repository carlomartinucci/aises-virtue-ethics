Given this scenario, I would review the relevant ethical guidelines and standards set forth by the American Bar Association, the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, and any other pertinent legal and ethical codes to determine if Justice Scalia breached any rules regarding his actions. If such standards were violated, I would consider reporting the matter to the appropriate authorities or seeking guidance from legal ethics professionals on how to address the situation, ensuring that judicial ethics and impartiality are upheld.
