I would suggest that the situation be thoroughly reviewed by an independent ethics committee or body to assess whether there was a conflict of interest concerning Justice Scalia's socialization with Vice President Cheney while the case was pending. This would help ensure transparency, uphold the integrity of the judiciary, and address any concerns about potential bias in the decision-making process.
