Given the scenario, I would first research and analyze the specific impact of the PRWORA on low-income families, particularly in terms of how many people were removed from welfare and their subsequent financial outcomes. This analysis would involve looking at data on employment rates, poverty levels, and the long-term effects of the bill on individuals and families.

Next, I would identify and reach out to various stakeholders, including former welfare recipients, advocacy groups, policymakers, economists, and social workers to gather a diverse range of perspectives on the issue. By listening to different viewpoints, I could gain a comprehensive understanding of how the PRWORA affected different segments of the population.

Based on the research and stakeholder feedback, I would develop a report or presentation outlining the strengths and weaknesses of the PRWORA and proposing potential policy changes or improvements to better support low-income families. This report would aim to inform current policymakers and the public about the implications of welfare reform and advocate for more effective strategies to alleviate poverty and promote economic stability among vulnerable populations.
