I would address the situation by first conducting a thorough investigation to gather all the facts, including speaking with Lochte and the other swimmers involved, as well as reviewing any available evidence such as witness statements or security footage from the gas station. Once I have a clear understanding of what actually occurred that night, I would work with Lochte to craft a sincere and detailed public statement taking full responsibility for his actions, acknowledging the harm caused to the Brazilian authorities, population, and the reputation of American athletes. This statement should also include a genuine apology and commitment to making amends, such as volunteering for additional community service or participating in educational efforts on responsible behavior abroad. Additionally, I would advise Lochte to engage in sensitivity training to increase his cultural awareness and understanding of privilege to prevent similar incidents in the future. Lastly, I would work with Lochte to restore his public image and seek opportunities for him to demonstrate growth and accountability.
