I would acknowledge the seriousness of the situation and take the following actions to address the aftermath of Ryan Lochte's actions:

1. Ensure Lochte issues a sincere and detailed public apology specifically addressing the Brazilian population for his overexaggeration and any harm caused by his actions.
2. Coordinate with U.S. Olympic officials to arrange for Lochte to participate in programs or initiatives that promote cultural understanding and good behavior in international competitions.
3. Work with Lochte to develop a plan for personal reflection and growth to prevent similar incidents in the future, which may include counseling or mentoring.
4. Collaborate with Lochte to engage in additional community service beyond the required 20 hours as a way to make amends for the negative impact of his actions.
5. Guide Lochte in seeking opportunities to educate others, especially young athletes, on the importance of honesty, responsibility, and accountability in high-pressure situations.
