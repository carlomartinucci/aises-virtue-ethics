I would reach out to Ryan Lochte to have a private conversation with him. During this conversation, I would express my concerns regarding his actions during the incident in Rio and the negative impact it had on various parties, including the Brazilian population, fellow athletes, and himself. I would emphasize the importance of taking responsibility for his mistakes, being truthful, and demonstrating sincere remorse for his actions.

I would offer support and guidance to Lochte in navigating the aftermath of the incident, including helping him craft genuine and meaningful apologies to those affected, as well as assisting him in identifying ways to make amends for his behavior. I would also encourage him to reflect on his choices and consider seeking counseling or support to address any underlying issues that may have contributed to his actions.

Furthermore, I would discuss the importance of rebuilding his reputation and regaining the trust of the public and his sponsors through consistent and genuine efforts to demonstrate personal growth and positive behavior moving forward. I would stress the significance of learning from this experience and using it as a catalyst for personal development and future decision-making.
