If I were in this scenario, I would first gather evidence of the unethical practices being conducted by Enron, particularly those impacting California's electricity markets and consumers. This evidence could include internal memos, emails, trading data, or testimonies from employees involved in the schemes.

Next, I would compile a detailed report outlining the specific fraudulent activities that Enron engaged in, such as submitting false demand schedules, creating imaginary transmission schedules, and selling non-existent services. This report would also highlight the negative consequences of these actions on California consumers, such as increased electricity prices and rolling blackouts.

I would then escalate these findings to relevant regulatory authorities in California, such as the California Public Utilities Commission or the California Energy Commission. It would be important to provide concrete evidence and clear explanations to support any allegations of misconduct, in order to facilitate swift and effective investigation by the authorities.

Additionally, I would consider reaching out to media outlets or journalists who have covered Enron's activities in the past, in order to raise public awareness about the company's fraudulent practices and the impacts on consumers. This could help to pressure regulatory bodies to take action and ensure accountability for Enron's actions.

Overall, my actions would focus on exposing and addressing the unethical behavior of Enron in the California electricity markets, in order to protect consumers and uphold the integrity of the energy sector.
