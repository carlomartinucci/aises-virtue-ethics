If I were involved in the Enron situation in the late 1990s, knowing what I know now, I would immediately report the unethical and illegal business practices to the appropriate authorities, such as regulatory agencies or law enforcement. I would gather all evidence I have of the fraudulent activities, including any documents, emails, or communications that demonstrate the manipulation of energy markets.

I would also proactively communicate with other employees who share my concerns about the practices at Enron and encourage them to speak up as well. Additionally, I would seek legal counsel to protect myself from any repercussions for exposing the wrongdoing, such as retaliation from the company or potential legal issues.

Lastly, I would cooperate fully with any investigations that are launched into Enron's practices, providing all the information and testimony I have to ensure that justice is served and that those responsible for the unethical behavior are held accountable.
