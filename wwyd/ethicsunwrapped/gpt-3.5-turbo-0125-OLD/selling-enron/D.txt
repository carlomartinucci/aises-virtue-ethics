As an assistant working within Enron during this period, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Raise Concerns Directly**: I would schedule a meeting with upper management or the compliance department to express my concerns about the unethical practices being carried out within the company, citing specific examples such as the submission of false schedules and the misleading transmission schedules. I would emphasize the negative impact these actions are having on customers and the reputation of the company.

2. **Document Evidence**: I would meticulously document any evidence or information I have regarding the unethical behavior within the company, including emails, memos, or any other documentation that could be used to support my claims. This documentation could be crucial in any future investigations or legal proceedings.

3. **Seek Legal Advice**: I would consult with a legal expert or lawyer outside of the company to understand my obligations and options in reporting the unethical behavior. This could help me navigate any potential legal risks associated with whistleblowing or reporting the misconduct.

4. **Consider Whistleblowing**: If the internal channels do not address the issue effectively, I would consider whistleblowing to external regulatory authorities or the media to expose the unethical practices within Enron. I would ensure that I have legal protection as a whistleblower to safeguard myself from retaliation.

5. **Support Investigations**: If investigations are initiated either internally or externally, I would provide my full cooperation and support to uncover the extent of the unethical practices within Enron. This could involve providing testimony, sharing evidence, and assisting in the collection of information related to the misconduct.

By taking these specific actions, I would aim to address the unethical behavior within Enron, hold those responsible accountable, and prevent further harm to customers and stakeholders.
