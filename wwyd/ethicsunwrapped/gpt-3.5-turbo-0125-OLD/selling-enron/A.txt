Given the situation with Enron in the late 1990s, if I were involved in the company at that time, my specific action would be to immediately report any unethical or illegal activities I witness within the organization to the appropriate authorities or regulatory bodies. This could include disclosing the fraudulent schemes, such as submitting false demand schedules and transmission schedules, that were intended to manipulate electricity markets and harm consumers. I would also make sure to document all the evidence available to support these claims to ensure a thorough investigation takes place. It is crucial to act with integrity and honesty in such situations to prevent further harm and hold those responsible for their actions.
