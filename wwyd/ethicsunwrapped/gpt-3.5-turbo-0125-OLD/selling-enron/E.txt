If I were in this scenario, I would gather concrete evidence of the fraudulent activities being conducted by Enron employees, such as the schemes mentioned in *The Smartest Guys in the Room*. This evidence could include communications, transaction records, and any other documentation that supports the unethical practices. Additionally, I would compile information on the impact of these activities on customers, such as the increased electricity prices and blackouts experienced in California.

Next, I would report these findings to the relevant regulatory authorities, such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to initiate investigations into Enron's practices. I would also cooperate with law enforcement agencies to ensure that those responsible for the fraudulent activities are held accountable.

Furthermore, I would work with internal compliance and legal teams to review and strengthen company policies and procedures to prevent similar unethical behavior in the future. This may involve implementing stricter controls, enhancing transparency in trading practices, and providing ethics training to employees to ensure a culture of integrity within the organization.
