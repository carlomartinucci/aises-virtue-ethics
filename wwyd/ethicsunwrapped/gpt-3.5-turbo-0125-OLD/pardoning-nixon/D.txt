Given the situation, I would analyze the unique circumstances surrounding the pardon of Richard Nixon by President Ford in 1974. I would consider consulting legal experts and advisors within the administration to fully understand the implications of the pardon and its impact on public perception. Additionally, I would assess the potential consequences of the pardon on public trust in the government and evaluate whether alternative actions could have been taken to address the Watergate scandal without pardoning Nixon.
