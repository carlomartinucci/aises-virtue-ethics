In this scenario, I would first investigate and verify the medical reports on Richard Nixon's health condition, including the diagnosis of viral pneumonia and a possible recurrence of phlebitis. I would consult with medical experts and review all available documentation to ensure there is a clear understanding of Nixon's health status at the time of the pardon.

Next, I would conduct a thorough review of the circumstances surrounding the pardon of Nixon by President Ford. I would gather all relevant information, such as communications, official statements, and advice received by President Ford regarding the pardon decision. It is crucial to understand the reasoning and factors that influenced President Ford's decision to grant a full and absolute pardon to Nixon.

Furthermore, I would analyze the public reaction and sentiments towards the pardon, including the suspicions of a possible deal between Ford and Nixon. I would assess the available evidence and testimonies to determine the validity of these allegations and address any concerns about the transparency and integrity of the pardon process.

Finally, based on my findings and analysis, I would provide a comprehensive report to President Ford outlining the key considerations, implications, and possible repercussions of the pardon. This report would include recommendations on how to address the public backlash and rebuild trust in the executive branch, taking into account the ethical and moral considerations at play in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal and the pardon decision.
