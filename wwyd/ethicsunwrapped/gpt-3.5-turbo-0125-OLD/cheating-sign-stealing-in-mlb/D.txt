If I were in this scenario, upon learning about the Astros' sign-stealing scheme, I would promptly report the unethical behavior to the appropriate authorities within the organization, such as the team owner or higher-level executives. I would provide any evidence or information that I have about the scheme and its participants. Additionally, I would support any investigation that is conducted to uncover the extent of the cheating and ensure that appropriate disciplinary actions are taken against those involved.
