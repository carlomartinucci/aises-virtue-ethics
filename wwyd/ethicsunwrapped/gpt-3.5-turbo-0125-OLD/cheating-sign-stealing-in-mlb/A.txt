If I were in a position to address this situation, I would first conduct a thorough internal investigation within the Houston Astros organization to determine the extent of involvement of all individuals, including players, coaches, and executives, in the sign-stealing scandal. This investigation would involve reviewing all available evidence, such as email communications, meeting notes, and testimonies from those involved.

After gathering all relevant information, I would present the findings to the appropriate authorities, such as Major League Baseball (MLB) officials. I would cooperate fully with any league investigations and provide complete transparency to ensure accountability for the actions taken by the organization.

Furthermore, I would take immediate steps to implement strict policies and procedures to prevent future incidents of cheating or unethical behavior within the organization. This might include increased monitoring of communication channels, regular training on MLB rules and regulations, and fostering a culture of integrity and ethical conduct among all staff members.

Lastly, I would issue a public statement on behalf of the Houston Astros, acknowledging the wrongdoing, expressing remorse for the damage caused to the integrity of the game, and outlining the steps being taken to rectify the situation and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
