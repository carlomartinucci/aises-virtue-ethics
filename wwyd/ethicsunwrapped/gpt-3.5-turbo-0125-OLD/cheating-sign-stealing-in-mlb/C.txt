One specific action I would take in this scenario is to report the illegal sign-stealing activities of the Houston Astros to Major League Baseball. This reporting would involve providing detailed information about the "Codebreaker" system and the use of technology to decipher and relay signs to batters. By reporting this violation of MLB rules, I would be helping to uphold the integrity of the game and promote fair play among all teams.
