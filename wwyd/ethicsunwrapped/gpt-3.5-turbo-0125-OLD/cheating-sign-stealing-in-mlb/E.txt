If I were in a position to address the sign-stealing scandal involving the Houston Astros, I would conduct a thorough internal investigation within the organization to determine the extent of involvement by individuals at all levels, including players, coaches, and executives. This investigation would involve reviewing communication records, emails, and any other relevant documentation that could shed light on who was aware of and participated in the sign-stealing scheme.

I would take immediate corrective action based on the findings of the investigation, which could include terminating individuals who were found to have played a role in the sign-stealing scheme, issuing public apologies on behalf of the organization, and implementing new policies and procedures to ensure compliance with MLB rules in the future.

Furthermore, I would cooperate fully with MLB's ongoing investigation into the matter and accept any disciplinary actions imposed by the league to demonstrate accountability and a commitment to upholding the integrity of the game.

Additionally, I would work on rebuilding trust with fans, players, and other teams by openly acknowledging the wrongdoing, taking responsibility for the actions of those involved, and actively working to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. This may involve engaging with other teams and league officials to discuss ways to strengthen regulations and enforcement mechanisms related to electronic sign-stealing.
