I would recognize the severity and impact of Jack Abramoff's actions on the Native American tribes he was supposed to serve as a lobbyist. To address this issue, I would advocate for increased transparency in lobbying activities, including full disclosure of financial interests and potential conflicts of interest to clients. I would work with legislators to establish stronger regulations and oversight of lobbying practices to prevent similar abuses of power and exploitation of vulnerable communities in the future. Additionally, I would support initiatives that empower Native American tribes to protect their interests and assert their sovereignty in dealings with lobbyists and government officials.
