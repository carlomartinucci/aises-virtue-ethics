I would first thoroughly review all the contracts and agreements Jack Abramoff has with the Native American tribes to determine whether there are any discrepancies or hidden conflicts of interest that need to be addressed. I would then organize a meeting with the tribal leaders to transparently communicate any findings and discuss potential next steps, such as renegotiating the terms of their agreements with Abramoff's consulting firm or seeking legal counsel to explore options for recovering any improperly charged fees. Finally, I would work with the tribes to establish stronger oversight mechanisms to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future and ensure that their interests are protected during any renegotiations or legal proceedings.
