I would work to ensure full transparency in all my dealings with clients, including disclosing any potential conflicts of interest. I would refrain from mocking or disrespecting clients, maintaining a professional and ethical demeanor at all times. Additionally, I would allocate funds earned from my lobbying activities responsibly, ensuring that they are used to benefit causes and organizations that align with ethical values and principles.
