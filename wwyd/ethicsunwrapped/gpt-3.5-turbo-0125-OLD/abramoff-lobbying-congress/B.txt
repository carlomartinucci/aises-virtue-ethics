If I were in a similar situation, I would take immediate action to disclose any potential conflicts of interest to my clients and ensure transparency in all dealings. This would involve openly discussing with clients the full scope of services being provided, the fees involved, and any relationships that may impact the services provided.

Furthermore, I would implement strict internal policies to prevent any future conflicts of interest and ensure that all business practices are conducted ethically and in full compliance with the law. This includes obtaining informed consent from clients before engaging in any lobbying activities on their behalf and maintaining open communication throughout the process.

I would also prioritize the well-being and best interests of my clients and act with full integrity in all dealings. This includes refraining from making derogatory comments or mocking clients, and treating them with the respect and professionalism they deserve.

Lastly, I would use my experiences and learnings to educate others in the industry about the importance of ethical conduct and the dangers of engaging in corrupt practices. This may involve speaking out against corruption and advocating for systemic changes to prevent similar scandals from occurring in the future.
