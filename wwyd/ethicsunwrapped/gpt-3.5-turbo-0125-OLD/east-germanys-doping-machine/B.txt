I would strive to prioritize the well-being of the athletes affected by the doping program. To address the ongoing issue of doping, I would collaborate with medical professionals, counselors, and relevant authorities to provide comprehensive support and healthcare services to the impacted athletes. This support should include medical evaluations to assess and address any physical health issues resulting from the doping, as well as mental health support to help athletes cope with the emotional and psychological effects of their experiences. I would work towards ensuring that affected athletes receive the necessary care and assistance to navigate the long-term consequences of the doping program. Additionally, I would advocate for transparency, accountability, and justice in handling the individuals responsible for implementing and perpetuating the doping practices, supporting affected athletes in seeking legal recourse if needed.
