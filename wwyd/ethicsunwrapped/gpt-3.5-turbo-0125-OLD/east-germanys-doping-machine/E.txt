I would provide support and resources for GDR athletes who have been affected by the doping program. This includes arranging medical evaluations and treatments for physical and psychological health issues resulting from the use of performance-enhancing drugs. I would also facilitate access to counseling and therapy services to help them cope with the emotional and mental toll of being subjected to doping against their will. Furthermore, I would assist in connecting them with legal counsel to explore options for seeking justice, compensation, or holding accountable those responsible for their suffering.
