I would prioritize the well-being and health of the current and former GDR athletes who were subjected to the doping program. I would collaborate with healthcare professionals to provide comprehensive medical evaluations and ongoing treatment for the athletes, addressing the physical and psychological effects of the doping. Additionally, I would assist in organizing support groups and counseling services to help the athletes cope with the emotional toll of their experiences and facilitate a sense of community and understanding among them. It is crucial to ensure that these athletes receive the care and support they need to navigate the long-lasting consequences of the doping program.
