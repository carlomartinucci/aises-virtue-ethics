I would gather detailed evidence and testimonies from the athletes who were subjected to the doping program in the GDR. I would work to ensure their stories are heard and documented accurately, shedding light on the coercion, harm, and ethical violations they experienced. This documentation could help in seeking justice, accountability, and support for the affected athletes. Additionally, I would collaborate with relevant authorities and organizations to advocate for proper acknowledgment of these atrocities and push for measures to prevent similar abuses in sports in the future.
