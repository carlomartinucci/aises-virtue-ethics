I would approach this situation by prioritizing the well-being and health of the affected athletes. I would work to ensure that those who experienced the harmful effects of the doping program receive immediate medical care and support for any physical or psychological issues they are facing. I would also advocate for thorough investigations to hold accountable those responsible for implementing and enforcing the doping program, including coaches, doctors, and government officials.

Moreover, I would support the athletes who chose not to participate in the doping program and faced repercussions by possibly assisting them in transitioning to a different career path or providing them with counseling and resources to cope with the aftermath of their decisions.

To prevent such unethical practices from happening in the future, I would collaborate with international sports organizations and governments to establish strict regulations and monitoring mechanisms to safeguard the well-being and integrity of athletes worldwide. Additionally, I would advocate for educational programs to raise awareness among athletes about the risks and consequences of performance-enhancing drugs and empower them to speak up against any forms of coercion or manipulation.
