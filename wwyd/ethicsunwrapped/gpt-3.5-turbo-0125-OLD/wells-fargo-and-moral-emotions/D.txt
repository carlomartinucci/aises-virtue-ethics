I would take the following steps in response to the Wells Fargo scandal:

1. Implement a comprehensive review of all sales practices within the bank to identify and rectify any unethical behavior.
2. Create a whistleblower program that provides protection for employees who report misconduct and ensures their concerns are addressed promptly.
3. Provide support and resources for employees who are experiencing stress and other negative symptoms due to the toxic corporate culture.
4. Conduct thorough training sessions for all employees on ethical behavior, compliance, and customer relations.
5. Establish clear and transparent communication channels for employees to raise any concerns they may have about sales targets or incentives.
6. Develop a mechanism for independent oversight to monitor sales practices and ensure compliance with regulations and ethical standards.
7. Communicate openly with regulators, customers, and the public about the steps being taken to address the issues and rebuild trust.
