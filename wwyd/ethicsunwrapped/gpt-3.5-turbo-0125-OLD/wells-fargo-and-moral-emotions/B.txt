I would take the following specific actions in response to the Wells Fargo scandal:

1. Implement a new incentive structure that does not focus solely on the number of accounts sold, but rather on customer satisfaction and ethical behavior.

2. Conduct a thorough review of internal policies and procedures to prevent fraudulent activities, including regular audits and oversight mechanisms.

3. Establish a clear and accessible whistleblowing mechanism for employees to report unethical behavior without fear of retaliation.

4. Provide support and resources for employees who have been negatively impacted by the toxic corporate culture, such as counseling services and stress management programs.

5. Publicly acknowledge and take full responsibility for the wrongdoing, issue a formal apology to affected customers, and work towards restitution and rebuilding trust with stakeholders.

6. Collaborate with regulatory agencies to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations, and foster a culture of transparency and accountability within the organization.

7. Hold senior management accountable for their actions and decisions, including appropriate disciplinary measures if they were found to be aware of or complicit in the fraudulent activities.
