If I were in this situation, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Review the compliance and ethics policies within the organization to ensure they are robust and clearly communicated to all employees.
2. Implement a system for employees to report unethical behavior anonymously and without fear of retaliation.
3. Conduct thorough investigations into any reports of misconduct, taking appropriate disciplinary action as necessary.
4. Provide support and resources for employees who may be experiencing stress or mental health issues due to workplace pressures.
5. Collaborate with regulatory authorities to address any violations and work towards rebuilding trust with customers and stakeholders.
6. Develop a comprehensive training program for employees on ethical guidelines, emphasizing the importance of integrity and accountability in all business practices.
7. Communicate openly and transparently with the public and shareholders about the steps being taken to rectify the situation and prevent future misconduct.
8. Establish regular audits and oversight mechanisms to monitor and enforce compliance with ethical standards throughout the organization.

These actions would be crucial in addressing the culture of fraud and misconduct that has plagued the organization and preventing similar issues from arising in the future.
