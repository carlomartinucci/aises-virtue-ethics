I would first prioritize reaching out to employees who are experiencing stress, panic attacks, and other symptoms as a result of the toxic corporate culture within Wells Fargo. Providing them with mental health support and resources should be a top priority to address their well-being and ensure they receive the necessary care.

Furthermore, I would actively encourage and support any whistleblowers who have come forward to report unethical behavior within the organization. Assuring them that their concerns are being heard and taken seriously is crucial in fostering a culture of transparency and accountability.

Lastly, I would work towards implementing significant changes in the corporate culture at Wells Fargo to prevent similar unethical practices from occurring in the future. This may include revising incentive structures, enhancing oversight mechanisms, and conducting regular ethics training for all employees to promote a culture of integrity and compliance.
