As a consumer advocate, I would proactively research and analyze the privacy policies and terms of service of various home DNA testing companies to understand how they collect, use, and share customer information. I would then create comprehensive and easily accessible resources that summarize the key points of these policies to inform consumers about the potential risks and implications of using home DNA testing services. Additionally, I would work on advocating for clearer and more transparent consent forms and data usage disclosures from these companies. I would engage with regulatory bodies and consumer rights organizations to push for stronger privacy protections and regulations within the home DNA testing industry.
