I would inform consumers about the potential risks and privacy concerns associated with home DNA testing. This could include creating informational materials that detail the types of information collected by testing companies, how that information could potentially be used or shared, and the potential implications of sharing genetic data with these companies. Providing this information would empower consumers to make more informed decisions about whether or not to proceed with home DNA testing and how to protect their privacy if they choose to do so. Additionally, I would advise consumers to carefully review the privacy policies and terms of service of any DNA testing company before submitting their samples. This would help consumers understand what they are agreeing to and the risks involved in sharing their genetic information.
