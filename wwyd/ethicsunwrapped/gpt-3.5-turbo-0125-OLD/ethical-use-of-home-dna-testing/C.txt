If I were faced with this scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Clearly inform consumers about the risks and potential implications of sharing their genetic information with commercial DNA testing companies.
2. Encourage consumers to carefully read and understand the privacy policies and terms of service provided by these companies before proceeding with any testing.
3. Advocate for greater transparency from DNA testing companies regarding the use and sharing of consumer data, including details on partnerships with other organizations.
4. Support efforts to establish regulations and guidelines to protect consumer privacy and data security in the home DNA testing industry.
5. Provide resources for consumers to make informed decisions about whether to share their genetic information for research or law enforcement purposes.
6. Educate consumers about the potential benefits and risks associated with sharing their genetic data for investigative genetic genealogy.
7. Support initiatives that aim to promote best practices for law enforcement agencies when using consumer genetic databases for criminal investigations.
8. Encourage consumers to proactively manage their privacy settings and permissions within DNA testing platforms to control the use of their genetic data.
