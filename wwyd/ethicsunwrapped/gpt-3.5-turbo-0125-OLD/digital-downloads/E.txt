If I were in this scenario, I would work towards enhancing communication and collaboration between artists, streaming services, and technology companies to establish fair compensation agreements for digital music streaming. This could involve organizing discussions, negotiations, and agreements that benefit all parties involved, ensuring that artists receive appropriate compensation for their work while also fostering innovation and access to music for listeners. Additionally, I would advocate for transparent and fair practices within the music industry to address ongoing issues related to artist compensation in the digital era.
