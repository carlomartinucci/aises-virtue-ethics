I would support the artists' right to fair compensation by advocating for the implementation of fair payment structures and ensuring that artists are adequately compensated for their work in digital music services. This could involve lobbying for legislation that protects artists' rights and negotiating fair deals between platforms and artists to ensure that they are compensated fairly for their work. Additionally, I would encourage consumers to support artists by purchasing music through legal channels and promoting awareness of the impact of piracy on artists' livelihoods.
