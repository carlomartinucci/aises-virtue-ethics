I would recommend that Apple Music compensate artists, writers, and producers for their music during the initial three-month free trial period. This includes renegotiating their agreements to ensure fair compensation during that time. Additionally, I would suggest Apple publicize these changes to demonstrate their commitment to supporting artists and addressing their concerns raised by Taylor Swift and others.
