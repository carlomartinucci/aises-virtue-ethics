In response to the scenario outlined, I would take specific action by contacting legal counsel to ensure that our file-sharing service is in compliance with all applicable copyright laws. I would also reach out to artists and industry stakeholders to discuss ways to fairly compensate artists for their work while also providing access to music for listeners. Additionally, I would explore opportunities to partner with streaming services and digital platforms to create mutually beneficial agreements that support both artists and consumers.
