In this scenario, I would advise taking the following concrete actions:

1. Ensure that any access to sensitive information, especially from rival teams, is done through proper channels and with explicit authorization.
2. If there are concerns about potential data theft or misuse by former colleagues, raise the issue with senior management or appropriate authorities rather than taking matters into one's own hands.
3. Refrain from engaging in any unauthorized access to another organization's systems, as this is illegal and unethical behavior.
4. If any suspicions regarding data theft or unauthorized access arise, cooperate fully with investigations and provide all necessary information to assist in resolving the situation.
5. If confronted with evidence of wrongdoing, admit to the actions taken, take responsibility for one's actions, and cooperate with the legal process to address the consequences.
6. Refrain from attempting to cover up or deny involvement in illegal activities, as this can exacerbate the situation and lead to more severe penalties.
