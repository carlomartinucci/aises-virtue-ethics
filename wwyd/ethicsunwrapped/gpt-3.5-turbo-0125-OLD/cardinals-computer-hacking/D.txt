I would report Chris Correa's actions to the appropriate authorities, such as the FBI or Major League Baseball (MLB), immediately upon discovering the hacking incident. I would provide them with all the relevant information and evidence available to assist in the investigation. I would also cooperate fully with the authorities to ensure that justice is served and the integrity of the sport is upheld.
