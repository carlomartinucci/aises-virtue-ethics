I would not engage in any form of unauthorized access to another organization's systems or data, regardless of the circumstances. If I had concerns about the potential misuse of proprietary information by former colleagues who joined a rival team, I would raise those concerns with my superiors or the appropriate authorities within the organization. I would emphasize the importance of maintaining ethical standards and respecting the privacy and intellectual property rights of other organizations.
