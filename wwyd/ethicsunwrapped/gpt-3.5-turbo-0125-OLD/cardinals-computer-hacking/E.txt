I would advise that the actions Chris Correa took were unethical and illegal. Hacking into another team's system to steal confidential information is a serious breach of trust and integrity. If I were in a similar position and suspected that former colleagues had taken sensitive information to a rival team, I would follow the appropriate and legal channels to address my concerns.

Firstly, I would raise my suspicions with the relevant higher-ups within the organization, such as the general manager or the team owner. I would request a thorough investigation to determine if any proprietary information had indeed been compromised and taken to the rival team. This would involve gathering evidence, conducting interviews with staff members involved, and reviewing internal security measures to prevent further breaches.

If the investigation confirmed that confidential information had been stolen, I would work with legal counsel to consider the appropriate course of action. This may include notifying the authorities, such as the FBI, and pursuing legal action against the individuals involved in the theft. It is crucial to handle such situations transparently and in accordance with the law to uphold the integrity of the organization and the sport.

Overall, maintaining ethical standards and adhering to the law is paramount in all professional endeavors, and any suspicions of misconduct should be addressed through proper channels to ensure fairness and justice for all parties involved.
