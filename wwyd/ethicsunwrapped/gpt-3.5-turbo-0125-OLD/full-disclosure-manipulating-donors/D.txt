I would approach Mary after the event and express my concerns about the misperception that Robert had regarding the shelter's clientele. I would suggest that it is important for the organization to be transparent about who they are helping and clarify any misunderstandings to donors, especially when their intentions might be based on misconceptions. I would recommend that in future interactions, we make sure to communicate clearly about the immigrant population the shelter serves to avoid any potential misinterpretations that could affect the organization's integrity.
