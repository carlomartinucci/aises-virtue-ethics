After the fundraising dinner, I would discreetly speak with Mary, expressing my concern about the misperception Robert had of Casa Tia Maria's clients. I would suggest that it is essential to be transparent and accurate about the organization's mission, including the fact that the shelter primarily serves Central American immigrants. I would recommend that in future interactions with donors, we need to be clear about who the shelter is helping to ensure mutual understanding and avoid any misunderstandings that might arise.
