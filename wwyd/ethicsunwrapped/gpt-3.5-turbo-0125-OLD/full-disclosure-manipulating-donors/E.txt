I would discreetly approach Mary after Robert has left and express my concern about the misperception he had regarding the shelter's clientele. I would suggest that it is important to clarify to donors the specific nature of the population being served by Casa Tia Maria to ensure transparency and honesty in fundraising efforts. Additionally, I would recommend discussing ways in which communication with potential donors can be improved to provide accurate information about the organization and its beneficiaries.
