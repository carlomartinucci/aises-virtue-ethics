I would approach Mary privately to discuss the situation. I would express that I noticed Robert's misunderstanding about the shelter's clients being immigrants rather than American citizens, and the ambiguity in Mary's responses to his questions. I would suggest that it is important to be transparent with donors about the organization's mission and the population it serves in order to maintain trust and integrity in fundraising efforts. I would recommend discussing with Mary how to address this situation with Robert in a respectful and informative manner to ensure he is fully aware of the shelter's mission and the impact of his donation.
