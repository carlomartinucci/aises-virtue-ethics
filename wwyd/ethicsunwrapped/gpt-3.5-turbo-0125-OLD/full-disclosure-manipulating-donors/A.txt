In this situation, I would approach Mary privately after the fundraising dinner and express my concerns about the misperception Robert had regarding the clientele of Casa Tia Maria. I would suggest to Mary that it is important to be transparent and provide accurate information to donors about the organization's mission and the individuals it serves. I would recommend that Mary consider reaching out to Robert to clarify the situation and ensure that he is aware of the true nature of the organization's work with Central American immigrants. It is essential to maintain clarity, honesty, and integrity in fundraising efforts to build meaningful and ethical relationships with donors.
