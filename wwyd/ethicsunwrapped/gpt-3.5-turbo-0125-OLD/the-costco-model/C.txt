Given the scenario, I would conduct a detailed analysis of the specific factors contributing to Costco's success, such as its higher wages, comprehensive benefits, low turnover rates, investment in employee training, and autonomy granted to employees. I would then compare these factors to those of competing companies like Walmart and Target, examining differences in business models, employee treatment, and productivity levels to identify concrete strategies that could be implemented by other companies to prioritize fair treatment of employees and long-term success.
