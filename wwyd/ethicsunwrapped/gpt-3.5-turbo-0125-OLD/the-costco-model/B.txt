In this scenario, I would conduct a detailed analysis comparing the business practices and models of both Costco and its competitors like Walmart and Target. This analysis would focus on factors such as employee wages, benefits, turnover costs, training programs, management style, and overall company culture. By examining the specific strategies and approaches that each company takes towards their employees and business operations, I would be able to identify key differences and similarities between Costco and its competitors that contribute to the perceived success of Costco as an ethical company. This analysis would help in understanding the practical implications of investing in higher employee wages and benefits, as well as shedding light on the broader business models that each company employs.
