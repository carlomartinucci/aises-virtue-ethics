In this scenario, if I were tasked with improving the ethical practices of a company similar to Walmart or Target, I would first conduct a thorough analysis of the company's operations to identify areas where improvements could be made to align with the ethical standards set by Costco. Specifically, I would focus on the following actions:

1. **Conduct a comprehensive review of the company's compensation and benefits policies:** I would assess the current wage levels, health benefits, retirement plans, and overall compensation packages offered to employees. I would compare these against industry benchmarks and best practices to identify areas for improvement.

2. **Implement a phased approach to increase employee wages:** Based on the review, I would develop a plan to gradually increase wages for employees to bring them closer to fair and competitive levels, similar to Costco's practices. I would ensure that these increases are sustainable and aligned with the company's financial capabilities.

3. **Enhance training and development programs:** I would invest in training programs to enhance the skills and capabilities of employees, empowering them to take on more responsibilities and contribute to the company's success. This investment in employee development would help increase job satisfaction and improve overall performance.

4. **Encourage employee autonomy and problem-solving:** I would promote a culture that values employee input and encourages them to take ownership of their work. Providing employees with autonomy to make decisions and solve problems would not only boost morale but also drive innovation and efficiency within the company.

5. **Evaluate opportunities to streamline operations:** I would assess the company's product offerings, distribution processes, and overall business model to identify opportunities to simplify operations and reduce unnecessary complexity. Streamlining operations could lead to cost savings, improved productivity, and a more efficient use of resources.

By taking these specific actions, the company can work towards creating a more ethical and employee-friendly environment, similar to the successful practices adopted by Costco. Implementing changes in compensation, employee development, autonomy, and operational efficiency could help enhance employee satisfaction, drive business success, and improve the overall ethical reputation of the company.
