I would research and analyze the specific business practices and strategies implemented by Costco that have contributed to its success in treating employees well, such as paying higher wages, providing comprehensive benefits, investing in employee training, and granting autonomy. I would then identify areas within the company where these practices can be replicated or adapted to different types of businesses, taking into consideration factors such as company size, industry, and target customer base. This analysis would involve studying how Costco's business model, including SKU management, plays a role in balancing high employee satisfaction with operational efficiency and productivity. Additionally, I would examine the financial impact of Costco's employee-focused practices on its overall success and compare it to competitors in the same industry to assess the feasibility and benefits of implementing similar practices in other companies.
