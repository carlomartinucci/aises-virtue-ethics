In this scenario, I would suggest conducting a detailed analysis to compare the business models of Costco, Walmart, and Target to identify specific factors contributing to Costco's success. This analysis should include an evaluation of their product offerings, customer base, operational practices, and employee management strategies to determine the key drivers behind Costco's ethical practices and financial performance. This detailed comparison would provide valuable insights into the potential replicability of Costco's model in different types of businesses and industries.
