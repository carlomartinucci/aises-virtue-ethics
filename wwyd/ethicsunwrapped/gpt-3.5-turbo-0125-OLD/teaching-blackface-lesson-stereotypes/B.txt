I would review the school's curriculum guidelines and policies regarding sensitive topics such as racism and discrimination. I would also investigate the procedures in place for addressing teacher conduct in classroom settings. Additionally, I would schedule a meeting with Alan Barron to discuss the incident and his perspective on the lesson in question. During the meeting, I would listen attentively to his explanation and reasoning for using the video with blackface in the lesson. I would also seek feedback from students, including Adrienne Aaron's daughter, and their parents to understand their perspectives on the lesson and its impact. Based on these discussions and reviews, I would determine if any further actions or educational interventions are necessary to prevent similar incidents in the future.
