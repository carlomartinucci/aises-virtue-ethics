I would first review the content of the history lesson that was taught by Alan Barron, specifically focusing on the context in which the video of the white entertainer in blackface was shown. I would also gather feedback from the students present during the lesson to understand their reactions and perspectives.

Next, I would meet with the assistant principal who raised concerns about the lesson and discuss her reasons for interrupting the video. I would aim to understand her perspective and reasoning behind labeling the lesson as racist.

I would then schedule a meeting with Alan Barron to discuss the incident and his intentions behind including the video in the lesson. I would provide him with feedback on how the content was perceived and discuss alternative ways to convey the historical information without causing offense.

Finally, I would organize a meeting with the parents, students, and stakeholders involved to address any lingering concerns and facilitate a dialogue surrounding the incident. I would emphasize the importance of open communication and respectful discussions when addressing sensitive historical topics in the classroom.

Throughout this process, my goal would be to ensure that all parties are heard, misunderstandings are clarified, and a constructive resolution is reached to prevent similar incidents in the future.
