If faced with a similar situation, I would meet with the assistant principal who objected to the lesson and the administration to clarify the educational intent behind showing the video of the white entertainer in blackface. I would explain the historical context and the importance of discussing such sensitive topics in the classroom to promote understanding and critical thinking among students. I would also offer to provide additional resources or alternative approaches to address the topic of racial stereotypes in a respectful and educational manner while ensuring that all perspectives are considered. Additionally, I would reach out to the parents who supported the lesson to hear their feedback and address any concerns they may have about the handling of the situation.
