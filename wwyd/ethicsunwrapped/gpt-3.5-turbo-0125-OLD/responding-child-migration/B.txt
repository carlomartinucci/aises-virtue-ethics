I would work within the framework of the Obama administration's multifaceted plan to address the influx of unaccompanied minors entering the U.S. I would focus on implementing the components of the plan, such as increased border enforcement, deportation of economic migrants, and expansion of detention facilities. Additionally, I would support the efforts to provide additional immigration judges to process claims for political asylum and refugees, as well as the programs aimed at addressing root causes in the countries of origin to discourage migration.

Given the logistical challenges of overwhelmed facilities at the border, I would assist in coordinating the transportation of migrants to other parts of the country where there is capacity to provide shelter and support. I would work with local communities to address concerns and ensure proper arrangements for receiving and accommodating the migrants.

Furthermore, I would collaborate with human rights organizations, refugee advocates, and religious institutions to ensure that the policies and actions taken prioritize the protection and well-being of the vulnerable children who are fleeing violence and poverty. I would advocate for a comprehensive approach that balances enforcement measures with humanitarian considerations and addresses the underlying issues driving migration.
