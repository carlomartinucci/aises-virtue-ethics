Given the scenario, I would coordinate with relevant government agencies and non-governmental organizations to ensure the safe transportation and resettlement of unaccompanied minors who have entered the country. This would involve working with social workers, immigration authorities, and local communities to provide temporary shelter, medical care, legal support, and access to education for these vulnerable children. Additionally, I would advocate for increased funding for programs aimed at addressing the root causes of migration in their home countries, such as violence and economic hardships, in order to prevent future influxes of child migrants.
