In response to the influx of unaccompanied minors illegally entering the country from Central America in the summer of 2014, as an official in the Obama administration, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Implement the emergency funding allocated to address the situation by prioritizing the well-being and safety of the migrant children.
2. Work to increase the capacity of existing shelters and detention facilities to provide humane living conditions for the minors while their cases are being processed.
3. Collaborate with local and state authorities to effectively manage and distribute the migrants to different parts of the country to alleviate overcrowding at border facilities.
4. Expedite the processing of asylum claims for those children fleeing violence in their home countries in order to provide them with legal protection.
5. Engage with international organizations, NGOs, and regional governments to address the root causes of migration from Central America and develop long-term solutions to prevent future waves of unaccompanied minors risking dangerous journeys to the U.S.
