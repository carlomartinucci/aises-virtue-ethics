As a response to the influx of unaccompanied minors illegally entering the United States from Central America in the summer of 2014, I would support and assist in the implementation of the Obama administration's multifaceted plan. This would involve coordinating and providing resources for the increased border enforcement, deportation of economic migrants, establishment of more detention facilities, hiring additional immigration judges to process asylum claims, and funding new programs in countries of origin to address the root causes of migration.

Additionally, I would work on facilitating the transportation of migrants to other parts of the country to alleviate overcrowding at the border facilities. This may include liaising with local authorities in destination areas to ensure smooth reception and integration of the migrants. Furthermore, I would engage in community outreach and education efforts to address any misunderstandings or prejudices against the migrant children and advocate for their humane treatment and protection.

Overall, my focus would be on supporting practical measures that address the immediate needs of the migrant children while also working towards long-term solutions that address the underlying causes of the crisis.
