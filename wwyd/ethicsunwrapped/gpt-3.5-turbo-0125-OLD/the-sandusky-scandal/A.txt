I would report the information I have about Jerry Sandusky's behavior to the appropriate authorities immediately, ensuring that the proper investigative steps are taken to protect any potential victims and bring justice to those who have been harmed. This action would involve contacting law enforcement agencies, child protective services, or relevant authorities to provide all relevant information I have about the situation, including any knowledge of past incidents involving Sandusky. I would prioritize the safety and well-being of any potential victims and ensure that appropriate action is taken to prevent further harm.
