I would immediately report the information provided by graduate assistant coach Mike McQueary about witnessing Jerry Sandusky fondling a young boy in the football locker room to the appropriate authorities, such as the police or child protective services. I would not keep this information quiet or try to handle the situation internally within the university. It is crucial to prioritize the safety and well-being of the children involved and ensure that proper authorities investigate and address the situation promptly.
