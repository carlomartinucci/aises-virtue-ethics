I would have immediately reported Jerry Sandusky's actions to the police or child protective services when I first became aware of the sexual abuse allegations. I would not have hesitated or delayed in taking action to protect the victims and prevent further harm. I would prioritize the safety and well-being of the children over any other concerns, including the reputation of the institution or the individuals involved. Reporting the abuse to the authorities would have been the most ethical and responsible course of action to take in such a situation.
