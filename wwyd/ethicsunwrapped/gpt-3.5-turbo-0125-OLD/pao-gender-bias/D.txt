If I were in a position to address the issues raised by Ellen Pao and her lawsuit against Kleiner Perkins, I would initiate an independent internal investigation into the allegations of gender discrimination and retaliation within the company. The investigation would entail reviewing performance evaluations, meeting summaries, and any relevant documents pertaining to Pao's employment and treatment at the firm. I would interview current and former employees, including Pao and the individuals mentioned in her allegations, to gather firsthand accounts and perspectives on the work environment and corporate culture at Kleiner Perkins. Additionally, I would assess the effectiveness of the firm's HR policies and procedures in addressing complaints of discrimination and harassment. Based on the findings of the investigation, appropriate actions and reforms would be implemented to ensure a more inclusive and equitable workplace for all employees.
