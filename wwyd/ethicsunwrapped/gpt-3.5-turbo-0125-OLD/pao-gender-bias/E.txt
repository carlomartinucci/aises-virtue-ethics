I would ensure that there are clear and effective processes in place for handling HR issues within the organization. This includes implementing transparent systems for reporting discrimination and harassment, providing adequate training on diversity and inclusion, and establishing policies that promote equal opportunities for all employees regardless of gender. Additionally, I would work towards creating a supportive and inclusive work environment where employees feel comfortable speaking up about any concerns they may have without fear of retaliation.
