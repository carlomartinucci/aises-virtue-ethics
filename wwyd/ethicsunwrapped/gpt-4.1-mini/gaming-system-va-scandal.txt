I would take the following concrete actions:

1. Collect and analyze raw appointment scheduling data directly from the VA hospital’s electronic health records system, including timestamps of when veterans first requested appointments, when they were placed on waiting lists, and when appointments actually occurred.

2. Compare this raw data against the reported wait times submitted by administrators to identify discrepancies and patterns of manipulation.

3. Interview clerks, schedulers, and frontline staff confidentially to gather firsthand accounts of scheduling practices and any pressures to alter wait time reporting.

4. Document all findings in a detailed report with specific examples of data manipulation and misreporting, including screenshots or printouts of conflicting records.

5. Submit this report to the VA Inspector General’s office and the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection to trigger a formal investigation.

6. Recommend immediate suspension of bonuses tied to wait time metrics until accurate, verifiable reporting mechanisms are implemented.

7. Propose the implementation of an independent, automated tracking system that measures wait times from the veteran’s initial appointment request to the actual appointment date, eliminating manual data entry points vulnerable to manipulation.

8. Advocate for regular, random audits of wait time data at all VA facilities to ensure ongoing compliance and transparency.

By taking these steps, I would directly address the data manipulation, provide evidence for accountability, and help establish systems to prevent future gaming of wait time metrics.
