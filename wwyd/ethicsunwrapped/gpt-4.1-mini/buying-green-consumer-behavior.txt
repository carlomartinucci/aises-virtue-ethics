I would design and implement a retail intervention that removes the element of consumer choice regarding green behaviors to reduce moral licensing effects. Specifically, I would work with a grocery store to make reusable bag usage mandatory at checkout rather than optional. This would involve:

1. Collaborating with store management to establish a policy requiring all customers to use reusable bags or pay a fee for single-use bags.
2. Training cashiers to enforce this policy consistently and politely inform customers about the requirement.
3. Placing clear signage at store entrances and checkout lanes explaining the mandatory reusable bag policy and its environmental rationale.
4. Monitoring sales data before and after the policy implementation to assess changes in the purchase of indulgent products like ice cream, cookies, and candy.
5. Conducting brief exit surveys with customers to gather feedback on their shopping choices and perceptions of the bag policy.

By removing the discretionary aspect of green behavior (bag choice), this approach aims to reduce moral licensing and encourage more consistent ethical consumption patterns.
