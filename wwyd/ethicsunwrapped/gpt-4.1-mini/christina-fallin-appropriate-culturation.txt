I would take the following specific actions:

1. Publicly issue a sincere apology on all social media platforms where the photo was posted, explicitly acknowledging the cultural significance of the headdress and admitting that wearing it without understanding or permission was disrespectful to Native American traditions.

2. Reach out directly to leaders and representatives of the Kiowa tribe and other Native American communities in Oklahoma to request a meeting or dialogue, aiming to listen to their perspectives and learn how to appropriately show respect for their culture.

3. Remove all promotional materials, merchandise, and imagery related to the headdress from my band’s website, social media, and shows permanently.

4. Organize and participate in a benefit concert or event with Native American artists and cultural educators to raise awareness about cultural appropriation and support Native American causes.

5. Commit to educating myself and my band members on Native American history and cultural protocols by attending workshops or seminars led by Native American experts before incorporating any cultural elements into future artistic work.

6. Publicly share resources and educational materials about the significance of Native American headdresses and cultural respect on my band’s social media channels to help inform fans and followers.

7. Avoid using any sacred or culturally significant Native American symbols or regalia in any future promotional or artistic content unless explicitly invited or collaborating with Native American communities.
