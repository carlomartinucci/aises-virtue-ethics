If I were involved in the production of Miss Saigon at that time, specifically as a casting director or producer, I would take the following concrete actions:

1. Launch a targeted, proactive nationwide and international casting search specifically for Asian and Eurasian actors aged 45-50 with classical stage experience. This would include reaching out to Asian theater companies, drama schools, and talent agencies specializing in Asian actors, as well as advertising in Asian American media outlets and theater networks.

2. Organize open casting calls and workshops in major cities with significant Asian populations (e.g., Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Vancouver, London) to discover emerging and established Asian actors who could fit the role of the Engineer.

3. Collaborate with Asian American theater organizations and unions to identify and encourage qualified Asian actors to audition, providing travel stipends or accommodations if necessary to remove financial barriers.

4. If no suitable actor with the exact profile and experience level is found after exhaustive search, consider adjusting the character’s age range or background slightly to expand the pool of qualified Asian actors, while maintaining the integrity of the role.

5. Document and publicly share the casting search process and criteria transparently to demonstrate good faith efforts toward racial authenticity and to address concerns from the Asian American community and Actors’ Equity Association.

6. If after these steps no Asian or Eurasian actor meets the role’s requirements, then consider casting Jonathan Pryce but accompany this with a public statement acknowledging the concerns raised, explaining the exhaustive search, and committing to more inclusive casting practices in future productions.

By taking these specific actions, I would directly address the controversy by prioritizing racial authenticity through a thorough and documented casting process before making a final casting decision.
