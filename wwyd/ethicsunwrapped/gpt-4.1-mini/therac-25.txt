I would take the following specific action: 

Immediately initiate a comprehensive, independent software and hardware audit of the Therac-25 system by assembling a multidisciplinary team including external safety engineers, software verification experts, and medical physicists. This team would be tasked with:

1. Reproducing the exact conditions under which the overdoses occurred by analyzing all available incident reports, machine logs, and patient treatment data.
2. Conducting rigorous, systematic testing of all software modules, especially those reused from earlier models, to identify race conditions, timing errors, or unsafe state transitions.
3. Verifying all hardware safety interlocks and microswitches to ensure they function correctly and cannot be bypassed by software commands.
4. Reviewing the entire software development lifecycle documentation to identify gaps in requirements, design, testing, and change management.
5. Implementing a mandatory, transparent incident reporting and tracking system within AECL that logs all errors, near misses, and repairs with clear accountability assigned to individuals or teams.
6. Temporarily halting all Therac-25 treatments until the audit confirms that all safety issues are resolved and verified by independent certification.
7. Publishing the audit findings publicly to ensure transparency and to restore trust among clinicians, patients, and regulators.

This concrete action plan focuses on identifying root causes, enforcing accountability, and ensuring patient safety through thorough technical and procedural review before resuming use of the machines.
