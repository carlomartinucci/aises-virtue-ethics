If I were a South Carolina state legislator at that time, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Draft and introduce a bill to remove the Confederate flag from the State House grounds, explicitly setting a firm deadline for removal within a week of the bill’s passage.

2. Organize and hold a public hearing inviting voices from multiple perspectives, including activists like Brittany Newsome, descendants of Confederate figures like Representative Jenny Anderson Horne, Confederate heritage groups such as the Sons of Confederate Veterans, and community leaders from affected communities.

3. Coordinate with law enforcement to ensure peaceful protests and prevent illegal actions like flagpole climbing, while also ensuring activists are treated fairly and their concerns are heard.

4. Work with the State House facilities team to prepare for the physical removal of the flag immediately after the bill’s passage, including securing a new location for the flag in a museum or historical archive rather than destroying it.

5. Launch a public education campaign explaining the reasons for the flag’s removal, emphasizing the goal of fostering unity and respect, and clarifying that the flag’s removal does not erase history but removes a symbol that many find hurtful.

6. After removal, commission a bipartisan task force to review other Confederate symbols on public property statewide and recommend appropriate actions, including possible relocation to museums or contextualization with plaques.

7. Publicly acknowledge the pain caused by the flag’s presence and commit to ongoing dialogue with all communities to promote healing and understanding.

By taking these concrete steps, I would actively facilitate the flag’s removal in a lawful, transparent, and inclusive manner.
