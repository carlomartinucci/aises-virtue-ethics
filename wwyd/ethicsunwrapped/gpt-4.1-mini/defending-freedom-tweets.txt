I would take the following specific actions:

1. Immediately review and delete the original tweets that sparked the controversy to prevent further escalation and misunderstanding.

2. Issue a clear, concise public statement on my official social media accounts explaining my intent behind the original tweets, emphasizing that my comments were meant to provoke thoughtful discussion rather than offend or disrespect anyone.

3. Personally reach out to key stakeholders affected by the controversy, including my team’s management, sponsors like Champion, and representatives of the military community, to apologize directly and clarify my position.

4. Arrange a meeting with my team’s public relations staff to develop a social media communication plan that includes guidelines for future posts, ensuring that my messages are carefully considered and aligned with both my personal values and the organization’s expectations.

5. Participate in a public forum or interview where I can openly discuss my views on the issue, demonstrating accountability and willingness to engage in constructive dialogue.

6. Commit to undergoing media training focused on social media use to better understand the impact of my words and how to express complex opinions responsibly in a public forum.

7. Monitor social media responses closely over the following weeks to address any ongoing concerns or misinformation promptly and respectfully.
