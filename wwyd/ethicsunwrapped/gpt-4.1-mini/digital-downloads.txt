If I were involved in managing a digital music platform or service in this context, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Implement a Transparent Royalty Payment System:** Develop and integrate a clear, automated system that tracks all streams and downloads accurately and ensures timely payments to artists, producers, and rights holders. This system would provide artists with real-time access to their earnings data through a dedicated dashboard.

2. **Negotiate Fair Compensation Terms:** Before launching any promotional offers (such as free trial periods), I would negotiate terms with artists and rights holders to ensure they receive at least partial compensation during these periods, avoiding the backlash seen in the Apple Music case.

3. **Create Tiered Access Models:** Design subscription plans that balance free or low-cost access for users with sustainable revenue streams for artists. For example, offer ad-supported free tiers with revenue sharing from ads, and premium tiers with higher artist payouts.

4. **Engage Artists in Platform Development:** Establish an advisory board of diverse artists, including emerging and established musicians, to provide ongoing feedback on platform policies, compensation models, and promotional strategies.

5. **Educate Users on Copyright and Artist Support:** Integrate educational content within the platform that explains how royalties work and encourages users to support artists by subscribing or purchasing music legally.

6. **Monitor and Enforce Copyright Compliance:** Use digital fingerprinting and content identification technologies to detect unauthorized uploads and prevent piracy on the platform, while providing legitimate sharing and discovery features.

7. **Promote Touring and Merchandising Opportunities:** Develop tools within the platform to help artists promote live shows and merchandise sales, supplementing income beyond streaming royalties.

By taking these concrete steps, I would aim to create a sustainable digital music ecosystem that respects copyright laws, fairly compensates artists, and provides accessible music to listeners.
