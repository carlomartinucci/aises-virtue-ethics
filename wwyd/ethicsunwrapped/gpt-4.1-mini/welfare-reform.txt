If I were a policy advisor or legislator reviewing the impact of PRWORA today, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Commission a comprehensive longitudinal study to track welfare recipients over a 10-year period, focusing on employment stability, income levels, and child well-being post-welfare reform. This would provide updated, data-driven insights into the long-term effects of the policy.

2. Draft and propose legislation to pilot voluntary employment programs that provide job training, childcare support, and transportation assistance without immediately cutting off financial aid, based on the 2016 reportâ€™s finding that voluntary programs increase employment without negative impacts.

3. Organize stakeholder meetings including former welfare recipients, social workers, economists, and child advocacy groups to gather qualitative data on the lived experiences of those affected by PRWORA, to inform more humane and effective policy adjustments.

4. Develop a targeted amendment to PRWORA that extends the time limit for federal assistance for single parents under 18 and immigrant families, addressing the most vulnerable groups identified as disproportionately harmed.

5. Collaborate with state governments to create flexible welfare-to-work programs that allow recipients to combine part-time work with continued financial support, aiming to reduce poverty without forcing recipients into unstable low-wage jobs.

6. Advocate for increased funding for affordable childcare and healthcare services linked to welfare programs, to remove barriers that prevent recipients from maintaining stable employment.

7. Publicly release a policy brief summarizing these findings and recommendations to inform public debate and encourage bipartisan support for reforming welfare policies to better balance individual responsibility with social support.

I would begin by commissioning the longitudinal study (step 1) to ensure all subsequent actions are grounded in current, comprehensive evidence.
