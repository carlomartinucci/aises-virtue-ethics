If I were in the position of Doubleday’s publisher Nan Talese after the exposé revealed fabrications in James Frey’s memoir, I would take the following concrete actions:

1. Immediately issue a public statement acknowledging the controversy and the specific inaccuracies identified by The Smoking Gun, without attempting to minimize or dismiss them.

2. Arrange a meeting with James Frey to review the allegations in detail and obtain a clear, documented explanation of which parts of the memoir were fabricated or exaggerated.

3. Halt further print runs and distribution of the book until a revised edition can be prepared that clearly distinguishes between factual events and fictionalized or dramatized elements.

4. Work with Frey to produce an updated version of the book that includes a foreword or afterword explicitly disclosing the nature and extent of the fictionalization, so readers are fully informed.

5. Coordinate with Oprah Winfrey’s team to publicly clarify the publisher’s position and the steps being taken to address the issue, aiming to restore trust with readers and the public.

6. Implement stricter fact-checking and editorial review processes for future memoir publications to prevent similar issues.

7. Offer refunds or exchanges to customers who purchased the original edition, through the publisher’s website and retail partners.

By taking these concrete steps, I would aim to transparently address the controversy, uphold the publisher’s credibility, and respect the readers’ right to accurate information.
