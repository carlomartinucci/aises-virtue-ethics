If I were in Ellen Pao’s position during her time at Kleiner Perkins, specifically after experiencing exclusion, harassment, and lack of support internally, I would take the following concrete actions:

1. **Document Everything Meticulously:**  
   I would keep a detailed, dated log of all incidents of discrimination, exclusion, harassment, and retaliation, including emails, meeting notes, messages, and any inappropriate gifts or conversations. This documentation would be organized chronologically and securely stored.

2. **Formally Report to HR and Senior Management:**  
   After initial informal attempts failed, I would submit a formal written complaint to HR and senior management outlining specific incidents, referencing my documentation, and requesting a clear, written response and action plan. I would send this via email or certified mail to ensure receipt.

3. **Request a Meeting with Outside Counsel or an Independent Investigator:**  
   Given the firm’s internal resistance, I would formally request that the firm engage an independent third party to investigate the claims of discrimination and harassment, emphasizing the need for impartiality.

4. **Seek External Legal Counsel Early:**  
   I would consult with an employment attorney experienced in gender discrimination cases to understand my rights, evaluate the strength of my claims, and prepare for potential legal action if internal remedies failed.

5. **Engage with Support Networks and Advocacy Groups:**  
   I would connect with organizations that support women in tech and venture capital, such as Women in VC or similar advocacy groups, to gain advice, mentorship, and public support.

6. **Prepare a Formal Memo to Leadership:**  
   As Pao did on January 4, 2012, I would draft a clear, professional memorandum detailing the issues, the impact on my work and the firm, and constructive suggestions for policy changes, explicitly stating my willingness to collaborate on solutions.

7. **Maintain Professionalism and Performance:**  
   Despite challenges, I would continue to perform my duties to the best of my ability, documenting successes and positive feedback to counteract any claims of poor performance.

8. **If Retaliation Occurs, Escalate Immediately:**  
   Upon any adverse action such as being passed over for promotion or termination, I would promptly notify my attorney and file complaints with relevant labor and equal employment opportunity agencies.

9. **Consider Public Disclosure as a Last Resort:**  
   If all internal and legal avenues fail, and after consulting with counsel, I would consider sharing my story publicly to raise awareness and pressure the firm to change, while carefully managing the risks involved.

By following these specific steps, I would build a strong, evidence-based case to address discrimination and retaliation, while advocating for systemic change within the firm and the industry.
