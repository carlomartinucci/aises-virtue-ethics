In this scenario, if I were Albert Snyder or acting on his behalf, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Document All Interactions and Evidence:** Collect and preserve all evidence related to the picketing, including photographs, videos, witness statements, and medical records showing the emotional and physical harm caused by the protests.

2. **Coordinate with Local Authorities:** Work closely with local law enforcement and municipal officials to ensure that any future protests comply strictly with local ordinances, and request that they enforce buffer zones or time restrictions to minimize disruption and distress during funerals.

3. **Engage a Public Relations Professional:** Hire a PR expert to manage public communications, focusing on honoring Matthew Snyder’s memory positively and countering the negative publicity generated by Westboro’s protests.

4. **Organize Community Support:** Mobilize community members, veterans’ groups, and religious organizations to hold counter-events or vigils that celebrate Matthew’s life and service, providing a supportive environment for grieving family and friends.

5. **Advocate for Legislative Change:** Work with lawmakers to draft and promote legislation that creates reasonable restrictions on protests at funerals, such as increasing the minimum distance protesters must maintain or limiting protest times, while respecting constitutional rights.

6. **Seek Counseling and Support Services:** Ensure that family members receive ongoing mental health support to address the emotional trauma caused by the protests and the legal battle.

7. **Explore Alternative Legal Avenues:** Consult with legal experts to identify any other possible claims or legal strategies that might provide relief, such as harassment or intentional infliction of emotional distress under different legal theories or jurisdictions.

By taking these concrete steps, I would aim to protect the family’s well-being, honor Matthew Snyder’s memory, and work toward preventing similar distress for other families in the future.
