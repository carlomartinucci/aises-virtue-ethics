If I were a faculty member or administrator at UNC during the time this scheme was occurring, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Request and Review Course Documentation:** I would immediately request the syllabus, assignments, grading criteria, and any records of student interaction for the 400-level AFAM summer course in question. If no syllabus or legitimate coursework exists, I would document this lack of academic rigor.

2. **Report to University Academic Integrity Office:** I would file a formal complaint with UNC’s Office of Academic Integrity or equivalent body, providing all evidence gathered about the suspicious course structure and grading practices.

3. **Interview Students and Staff:** I would arrange interviews with students enrolled in these “paper” courses, the professor Julius Nyang’oro, secretary Deborah Crowder, and academic counselors involved, to gather firsthand accounts of how the courses were administered and graded.

4. **Advocate for Immediate Suspension of the Course:** I would push for the immediate suspension of enrollment in these AFAM independent study courses until a full investigation is completed and proper academic standards are enforced.

5. **Collaborate with Athletic Department:** I would communicate with the athletic department to ensure they are aware of the academic irregularities and to prevent student-athletes from enrolling in these fraudulent courses.

6. **Recommend External Audit:** I would recommend that UNC commission an independent external audit of the AFAM department’s course offerings and grading practices, focusing on courses disproportionately taken by student-athletes.

7. **Support Whistleblowers:** I would offer support and protection to staff members like Mary Willingham who come forward with information about academic fraud, ensuring they are not retaliated against.

8. **Develop Transparent Policies:** I would work with university governance to develop and implement transparent policies requiring all courses, especially independent studies, to have clear syllabi, regular faculty interaction, and documented assessments.

By taking these concrete steps, I would actively work to expose and halt the academic fraud, protect the integrity of the university’s academic programs, and ensure student-athletes receive a legitimate education.
