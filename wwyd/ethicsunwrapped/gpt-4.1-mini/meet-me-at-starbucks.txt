I would take the following specific actions as a Starbucks store manager at that location immediately after the incident:

1. **Contact Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson directly** to apologize personally for the experience they endured, invite them back to the store for a private meeting, and offer to hear their concerns and suggestions on how to improve the store environment.

2. **Review and revise the store’s restroom policy** to explicitly allow non-paying customers to use the restroom, ensuring it aligns with company guidelines and is clearly communicated to all employees.

3. **Hold a mandatory staff meeting** the next day to review the incident in detail, explain why the actions taken were wrong, and introduce the upcoming company-wide racial-bias training. During this meeting, I would role-play scenarios to help employees recognize and prevent implicit bias.

4. **Implement a clear protocol for handling customers waiting for meetings or using the space without immediate purchases**, including training employees to engage respectfully and avoid assumptions based on race or appearance.

5. **Establish a feedback mechanism** such as a suggestion box or direct email line for customers and employees to report concerns about discrimination or bias, ensuring timely follow-up and resolution.

6. **Coordinate with the district manager and corporate diversity team** to schedule the store’s participation in the May 29, 2018, racial-bias education training and ensure all employees attend.

7. **Publicly post a visible notice in the store** stating Starbucks’ commitment to inclusivity and non-discrimination, including contact information for customers to report any issues.

By taking these concrete steps, I would work to repair trust with the affected customers, prevent future incidents, and align the store’s practices with Starbucks’ stated commitment to racial-bias education.
