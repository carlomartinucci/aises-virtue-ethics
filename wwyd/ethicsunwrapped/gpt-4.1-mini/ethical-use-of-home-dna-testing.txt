I would take the following specific actions:

1. Before purchasing or using any home DNA testing kit, I would thoroughly read the company’s current privacy policy and terms of service, focusing on how my genetic data and personal information will be used, shared, and stored.

2. I would opt out of any optional data sharing programs or research participation offered by the company to minimize the amount of my genetic data retained or shared with third parties.

3. After receiving my DNA test results, I would immediately delete my account or request deletion of my genetic data and personal information from the company’s database, following their data removal procedures.

4. I would avoid uploading any additional personal information, such as family photos or detailed family trees, to the company’s platform to reduce the risk of linking my genetic data to identifiable personal data.

5. I would refrain from connecting my DNA testing account to third-party services or apps that might further share or analyze my genetic data.

6. If I am concerned about law enforcement access, I would verify whether the company cooperates with law enforcement requests and consider using a company that explicitly does not share data with police.

7. I would monitor news and updates about the company’s data practices and any legal actions to stay informed about potential risks or changes in data handling.

8. Finally, I would consider consulting a genetic privacy expert or attorney if I have specific concerns about the implications of sharing my DNA data.
