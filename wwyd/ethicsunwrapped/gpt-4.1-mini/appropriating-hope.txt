If I were Shepard Fairey in this scenario, the specific action I would take is:

1. Before creating the artwork, I would contact Mannie Garcia directly to request permission to use the photograph as a reference, explaining my intention to transform it into a new piece of art.
2. If Garcia granted permission, I would negotiate terms for credit and compensation upfront, ensuring a written agreement that clarifies rights and usage.
3. If permission was denied or negotiations failed, I would either choose a different source image or create an original composition inspired by the themes I want to express, avoiding direct appropriation.
4. After creating the artwork, I would clearly credit Mannie Garcia as the original photographer in all public displays and merchandise.
5. If a dispute arose despite these steps, I would seek mediation or settlement early to avoid prolonged litigation, aiming for a fair financial agreement and shared rights if appropriate.

By taking these concrete steps, I would minimize legal risk and respect the original creatorâ€™s rights while still pursuing transformative artistic expression.
