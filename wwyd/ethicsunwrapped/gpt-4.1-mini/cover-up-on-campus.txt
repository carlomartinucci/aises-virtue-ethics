If I were in a position of authority at Baylor during this time, specifically as Art Briles or a senior football staff member aware of these incidents, I would take the following concrete actions immediately upon receiving any report or complaint of sexual assault or violence involving football players:

1. **Immediately report the complaint to the Title IX coordinator and university compliance office** without attempting to investigate or handle the matter internally within the football program.

2. **Suspend the accused player(s) from all team activities and games pending a full Title IX investigation**, to protect campus safety and demonstrate that misconduct is taken seriously.

3. **Document all communications and actions taken related to the complaint**, including dates, times, and persons involved, and provide copies to the Title IX office to ensure transparency and accountability.

4. **Prohibit any football staff from conducting their own investigations or interviews related to sexual assault complaints**, and instead cooperate fully with trained university investigators and law enforcement as appropriate.

5. **Communicate clearly and promptly with the complainant about their rights, available support services (counseling, medical, legal), and the university’s investigation process**, ensuring the complainant feels supported and informed.

6. **Immediately notify the university’s senior leadership (e.g., athletic director, president, chancellor) about the complaint and the steps being taken**, to ensure institutional awareness and oversight.

7. **Implement mandatory training for all football staff and players on sexual assault prevention, Title IX obligations, and university policies**, to change the culture and prevent future incidents.

8. **Establish a confidential reporting mechanism within the football program that directs all complaints directly to the Title IX office**, removing any gatekeeping by coaches or staff.

9. **Work with the university to review and revise football program policies to eliminate any internal disciplinary control over serious misconduct cases**, ensuring all such cases are handled by the appropriate university offices.

10. **Publicly acknowledge the seriousness of the issue and commit to transparency and accountability**, to rebuild trust with the campus community and demonstrate that football players are not above the rules.

If I had to pick just one action to do first, it would be: **Immediately report every complaint of sexual assault or violence involving football players to the Title IX coordinator and university compliance office, without exception or delay.**
