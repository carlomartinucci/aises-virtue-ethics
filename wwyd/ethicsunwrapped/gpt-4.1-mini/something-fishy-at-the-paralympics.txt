If I were involved in the Paralympic community as an official, coach, or athlete, here is a specific action I would take to address classification cheating:

I would develop and implement a rigorous, multi-step verification protocol for athlete classification that includes unannounced, random re-assessments throughout the training and competition periods. This protocol would require athletes to undergo surprise physical and functional evaluations by independent classifiers who are not affiliated with their national teams. These re-assessments would be scheduled without prior notice to prevent athletes from artificially altering their condition (e.g., taping limbs, using wheelchairs only during classification, or tanking). Additionally, I would incorporate objective biometric and physiological measurements—such as muscle strength testing, motion capture analysis, and medical imaging—to supplement subjective assessments and detect inconsistencies or sudden changes in impairment levels. I would also establish a secure database to track athletes’ classification history and test results over time, enabling the identification of suspicious patterns or discrepancies. Finally, I would mandate that all athletes sign legally binding declarations confirming the accuracy of their impairment status under penalty of suspension, fines, or permanent bans if found guilty of misrepresentation. This comprehensive approach would be communicated clearly to all athletes and coaches before competitions to deter cheating and uphold fair play.
