I would immediately report my suspicions about the former colleagues potentially taking proprietary information to the Cardinals’ legal and compliance departments, providing any evidence I had. I would then request a formal internal investigation to verify whether any confidential data or algorithms had been improperly transferred. Simultaneously, I would strengthen the Cardinals’ own data security measures by conducting a thorough audit of access logs, changing passwords, and implementing multi-factor authentication to prevent unauthorized access. I would avoid any unauthorized access to the rival team’s systems and instead focus on protecting my organization’s assets through legitimate channels.
