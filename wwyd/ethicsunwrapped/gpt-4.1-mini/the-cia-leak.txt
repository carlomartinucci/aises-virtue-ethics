If I were in a position of authority within the CIA or the Department of Justice during or after this incident, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Immediately conduct a comprehensive internal security audit** of all covert operatives and front companies to identify any vulnerabilities exposed by the leak of Valerie Plame’s identity. This would include reviewing all operational protocols, communication channels, and personnel security clearances.

2. **Implement enhanced protective measures** for all covert agents whose identities or operations might have been compromised, such as relocating agents, changing cover identities, and increasing surveillance on potential threats.

3. **Establish a mandatory training program** for all government officials and staff on the legal and operational importance of protecting classified information, specifically emphasizing the consequences of unauthorized disclosures of covert operatives’ identities.

4. **Coordinate with the Department of Justice to develop a clear, expedited protocol** for investigating and prosecuting leaks of classified information, ensuring that investigations are thorough, impartial, and timely to deter future breaches.

5. **Engage directly with the White House and senior administration officials** to communicate the national security risks posed by such leaks and to advocate for strict adherence to classification rules, including requesting that any pardon considerations for individuals convicted of related offenses undergo rigorous Justice Department review before being granted.

6. **Support and facilitate the civil lawsuit efforts** by Wilson and Plame by providing necessary factual information and expert testimony to hold accountable those responsible for the leak, aiming to establish stronger legal precedents protecting covert operatives.

7. **Develop a public communication strategy** to explain the risks and consequences of leaking classified information to the media, aiming to build public understanding and support for protecting national security interests.

By taking these concrete steps, I would work to mitigate the damage caused by the leak, prevent future occurrences, and uphold the integrity and safety of covert operations.
