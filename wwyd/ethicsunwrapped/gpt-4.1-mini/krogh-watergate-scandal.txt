If I were in Egil “Bud” Krogh’s position at the time the break-in was proposed, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Before agreeing to participate, I would request a formal written legal opinion from the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (or equivalent legal authority) explicitly assessing the legality of the proposed break-in at the psychiatrist’s office.

2. If no such opinion was provided or if the opinion indicated illegality, I would refuse to authorize or participate in the operation.

3. I would document my objections in writing, addressed to John Ehrlichman and other relevant superiors, clearly stating my concerns about the legality and potential ethical violations of the operation.

4. I would escalate my concerns by requesting a meeting with higher-level legal advisors or the Attorney General to review the operation’s legality and appropriateness.

5. If pressured to proceed despite these objections, I would formally resign from my position to avoid complicity in illegal activities.

6. After refusing to participate or resigning, I would report the proposed illegal activity to the appropriate oversight bodies, such as the Senate Watergate Committee or the FBI, to ensure accountability.

By taking these concrete steps, I would avoid participating in illegal actions and uphold my professional and legal responsibilities.
