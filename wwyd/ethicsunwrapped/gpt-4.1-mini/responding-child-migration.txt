If I were a federal official responsible for managing the influx of unaccompanied minors in 2014, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Immediately coordinate with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to expand and expedite placement of minors in licensed foster care or with vetted sponsors, rather than relying solely on detention centers, to reduce overcrowding and improve child welfare.

2. Deploy additional trained social workers and child welfare specialists to border facilities to conduct rapid but thorough assessments of each minor’s background, trauma, and asylum claims, ensuring vulnerable children receive appropriate care and legal assistance.

3. Work with the Department of Justice to increase the number of immigration judges and support staff specifically assigned to hear asylum cases from unaccompanied minors, setting up dedicated court dockets to reduce backlog and speed up processing times.

4. Launch a targeted public information campaign in Central American countries, in partnership with local NGOs and governments, to inform potential migrants about the dangers of the journey and the legal requirements for asylum, aiming to reduce the number of children attempting the trip.

5. Coordinate with local governments and community organizations in U.S. cities receiving transported minors to establish welcoming centers that provide culturally sensitive services, including language interpretation, legal aid, education, and mental health support, to ease integration and address community concerns.

6. Implement a data tracking system that follows each minor’s case from apprehension through placement and legal resolution, ensuring accountability and enabling continuous improvement of policies and resource allocation.

By taking these concrete steps, I would aim to address the immediate humanitarian needs of the children while improving the efficiency and fairness of the immigration process.
