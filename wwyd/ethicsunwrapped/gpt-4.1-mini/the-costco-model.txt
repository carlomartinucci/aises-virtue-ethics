If I were a manager at a mid-sized retail company looking to improve both employee satisfaction and company performance, I would take the following concrete actions inspired by Costco’s model and the context provided:

1. **Conduct a SKU Rationalization Audit:**  
   I would analyze our current product assortment to identify opportunities to reduce complexity by cutting low-turnover or redundant SKUs, aiming to simplify inventory management and reduce operational overhead, similar to Costco’s limited SKU approach.

2. **Increase Starting Wages by 20-30%:**  
   I would propose and implement a phased wage increase for frontline employees, targeting a 20-30% raise over current levels, to improve employee retention and morale, while monitoring the impact on turnover and productivity.

3. **Enhance Employee Benefits Package:**  
   I would expand health and retirement benefits to be more comprehensive, benchmarking against Costco’s offerings, including options like employer-matched retirement contributions and improved health insurance plans.

4. **Implement Cross-Training Programs:**  
   I would develop training modules that empower employees to perform multiple roles (e.g., stocking, customer service, cashiering), increasing their autonomy and flexibility, and reducing dependency on specialized staff.

5. **Establish a Layoff Avoidance Policy:**  
   I would create a formal policy prioritizing alternatives to layoffs, such as reduced hours, voluntary unpaid leave, or internal transfers, to maintain workforce stability during downturns.

6. **Set Up Employee Feedback Channels:**  
   I would launch regular, structured feedback sessions and anonymous surveys to gather employee input on workplace improvements and operational challenges, ensuring their voices influence management decisions.

7. **Pilot a Simplified Store Layout:**  
   I would redesign one store’s layout to mimic Costco’s pallet-based stocking and open floor plan, reducing stocking time and enabling customers to self-serve more efficiently, then measure effects on labor costs and sales.

By executing these specific steps, I would aim to replicate key elements of Costco’s success—simplified operations, better employee compensation and benefits, and empowered workers—while adapting to the scale and customer base of my company.
