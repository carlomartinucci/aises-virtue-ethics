I would organize and participate in a community forum that brings together bullfighting supporters, animal rights activists, local government officials, and cultural historians. In this forum, I would facilitate structured discussions where each group can present their perspectives and concerns. I would also propose the creation of a pilot program in a local bullfighting venue to implement non-lethal bullfighting events, such as those practiced in some Catalonian towns, where the bull is not killed but the cultural and artistic elements are preserved. Additionally, I would collaborate with local media to document and broadcast these events and discussions to raise public awareness and encourage informed dialogue. Finally, I would work with policymakers to explore regulations that balance cultural preservation with animal welfare, such as mandatory veterinary oversight during events and limits on the number of bullfights per year.
