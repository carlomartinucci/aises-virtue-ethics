I would take the following specific actions as Dr. Jones:

1. Review the most current, peer-reviewed research on flu vaccine efficacy and safety, focusing on data relevant to elderly patients, to ensure my knowledge is up to date and accurate.

2. Develop a clear, evidence-based informational handout summarizing the known benefits, limitations, and risks of flu vaccination specifically for senior patients, including the data on reduced efficacy and potential adverse events.

3. During consultations with senior patients, proactively provide this handout and verbally explain the information, emphasizing that while the vaccine is generally recommended, its effectiveness may be limited in their age group and that they have the right to make an informed decision.

4. Document in each patient’s medical record that I have provided this information and discussed the risks and benefits of the flu vaccine, noting the patient’s decision regarding vaccination.

5. Continue to comply with hospital policy by receiving the annual flu shot myself to maintain my employment and hospital privileges.

6. Seek a confidential meeting with hospital administration to discuss the possibility of incorporating more nuanced patient education materials about flu vaccine efficacy for seniors, aiming to align patient autonomy with institutional policies.

7. Monitor any changes in vaccine recommendations or new diagnostic tools (such as the gene expression assay) and update patient information accordingly.

By taking these steps, I would fulfill my obligation to inform patients adequately while maintaining my professional standing and employment.
