I would take the following specific actions:

1. File a formal motion requesting Justice Scalia’s recusal from the Cheney v. U.S. District Court case, citing the duck hunting trip as a concrete instance that reasonably calls his impartiality into question under federal law.

2. Submit detailed evidence of the trip, including dates, participants, and any public statements or media coverage, to support the motion and demonstrate the appearance of potential bias.

3. Publicly document and communicate the motion and its basis through legal briefs and press releases to ensure transparency and maintain public confidence in the judicial process.

4. Request that the Supreme Court establish clear guidelines or a code of conduct regarding social interactions between justices and parties involved in pending cases, to prevent similar conflicts in the future.

5. If the motion is denied, prepare to raise the issue in subsequent appeals or related proceedings, emphasizing the importance of judicial impartiality and the appearance thereof.

By taking these concrete steps, I would actively address the conflict of interest concern raised by Justice Scalia’s social interaction with a party in the case.
