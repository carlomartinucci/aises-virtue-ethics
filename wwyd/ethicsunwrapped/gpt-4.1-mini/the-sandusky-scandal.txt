If I were in Joe Paterno’s position in 2001, after hearing from Mike McQueary about Sandusky’s sexual abuse in the locker room shower, I would take the following concrete action immediately:

1. Contact the Pennsylvania child protective services hotline and the local police department to report the abuse allegation against Sandusky, providing all details that McQueary shared with me.

This would be done before informing or discussing the matter with any university administrators or colleagues, to ensure that the proper authorities are involved right away and an official investigation can begin without delay. I would also document the report by keeping a dated record of the call and the information provided.

Taking this step would prioritize the safety and well-being of the victim and any other potential victims, and comply with mandatory reporting laws.
