I would take the following specific actions:

1. Obtain and review all available Tyco International financial records, board meeting minutes, and internal communications from Kozlowski’s tenure to identify the exact authorization processes for bonuses and expenses.

2. Interview former Tyco board members and executives to determine whether Kozlowski had explicit or implicit approval for the bonuses and personal expenditures.

3. Analyze the company’s corporate governance policies at the time to assess if Kozlowski’s actions violated established procedures or if there were loopholes he exploited.

4. Compile a detailed timeline correlating Kozlowski’s personal expenses and bonuses with board approvals or lack thereof.

5. If I were a legal professional or investigator, I would prepare a report summarizing findings on whether Kozlowski’s actions were authorized or unauthorized, focusing on documentary evidence rather than intent claims.

6. If I were advising a corporate compliance team, I would recommend implementing stricter controls on executive compensation approvals and personal expense reimbursements to prevent similar abuses.

7. If I were a journalist or researcher, I would publish a fact-based article or case study highlighting the discrepancies between Kozlowski’s claims and the documented evidence of authorization.

Among these, if I had to pick one concrete action, I would start by obtaining and thoroughly reviewing all relevant financial records and board minutes to establish a factual basis for authorization or lack thereof.
