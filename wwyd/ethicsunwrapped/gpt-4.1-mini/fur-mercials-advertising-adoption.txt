I would take the following specific actions:

1. Analyze the existing “In-FUR-mercial” campaign data to identify which messages, tones, and pet “uses” resonated most strongly with the target audience in Las Vegas.

2. Develop a follow-up campaign that builds on the successful elements of the original ads but introduces new, creative pet “uses” and scenarios to maintain audience interest and engagement.

3. Coordinate with the Animal Foundation to create targeted digital ads on social media platforms popular in Clark County, using the humorous tone and style proven effective, to drive traffic to NewPetNow.com.

4. Organize a series of community events or pop-up adoption fairs in high-traffic areas of Las Vegas, featuring live demonstrations of pets’ “multi-purpose” traits from the campaign, to create direct engagement and increase adoptions.

5. Collaborate with local businesses to sponsor adoption incentives (e.g., discounts on pet supplies or services) tied to the campaign’s messaging, encouraging adoption through tangible benefits.

6. Implement a monthly internal newsletter within R&R Partners to keep all employees updated on campaign progress and adoption statistics, sustaining morale and agency-wide investment.

7. Establish a feedback loop with the Animal Foundation staff and adopters to gather qualitative insights on how the campaign influences perceptions and adoption decisions, informing continuous improvement.

8. Secure additional pro bono creative resources within R&R Partners to produce short-form video content and user-generated content contests that encourage community participation and sharing of adoption stories aligned with the campaign’s tone.

By executing these concrete steps, I would aim to sustain and amplify the campaign’s positive impact on pet adoption rates and community engagement.
