I would take the following specific actions:

1. Immediately request a meeting with the assistant principal and the superintendent to clarify the intent and content of the lesson, providing a detailed lesson plan and context for the video used.

2. Gather written statements from students and parents, like Adrienne Aaron, who support the educational value of the lesson to demonstrate community backing.

3. Document all communications and events related to the suspension and reinstatement to create a clear record.

4. Propose a professional development session for staff on how to handle sensitive historical content appropriately, including guidelines for context-setting and student support.

5. Before retirement, prepare a reflective report summarizing the incident, lessons learned, and recommendations for future handling of similar topics to leave a constructive legacy for the school.

6. Communicate transparently with students and parents about the purpose of the lesson and the importance of understanding historical racism to foster an informed classroom environment.
