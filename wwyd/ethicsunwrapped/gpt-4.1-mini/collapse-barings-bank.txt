If I were in Nick Leeson’s position upon realizing the initial loss in the error account, I would take the following concrete actions immediately:

1. **Report the Loss to My Direct Supervisor:** I would draft a detailed written report explaining the loss, how it occurred, and the current status of the error account. I would send this report via email and request an urgent meeting to discuss the situation.

2. **Notify the Risk Management and Compliance Departments:** I would escalate the issue by informing the bank’s risk management and compliance teams, providing them with all relevant trading records and account statements to ensure transparency.

3. **Cease Further Speculative Trading:** I would immediately stop all speculative trading activities to prevent further losses and avoid compounding the problem.

4. **Request External Audit or Review:** I would propose an independent audit or review of the error account and my trading activities to verify the situation and identify any systemic weaknesses.

5. **Collaborate on a Recovery Plan:** I would work with senior management and risk officers to develop a realistic plan to manage and mitigate the losses, including possible hedging strategies or capital allocation adjustments.

6. **Document All Communications and Actions:** I would keep meticulous records of all communications, decisions, and actions taken to ensure accountability and provide a clear audit trail.

By taking these specific steps, I would aim to contain the losses, maintain transparency, and enable the bank to respond appropriately before the situation escalated.
