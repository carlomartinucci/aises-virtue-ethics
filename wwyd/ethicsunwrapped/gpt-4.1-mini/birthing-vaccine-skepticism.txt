If I were in a position to act during the unfolding of this scenario, specifically as a colleague, institutional leader, or journal editor aware of Wakefield’s conduct and research, I would take the following concrete actions:

1. **As a hospital or university official (upon learning of the study and procedures):**  
   - Immediately suspend Wakefield’s research activities pending a full investigation into the ethical approval status of the endoscopies performed on children.  
   - Convene an independent ethics review board to audit the study’s protocol, consent forms, and patient recruitment methods.  
   - Require Wakefield to provide full disclosure of all funding sources, conflicts of interest, and any agreements with external parties such as attorney Barr.  
   - Notify regulatory bodies and medical licensing boards about the potential ethical violations and patient safety concerns.

2. **As an editor or reviewer at The Lancet (before or after publication):**  
   - Demand full disclosure of all conflicts of interest, including financial ties to litigation and patent applications, before accepting the manuscript.  
   - Request raw data and patient records to verify the accuracy of the reported diagnoses and timelines.  
   - If discrepancies or undisclosed conflicts are found, reject the manuscript or issue an immediate retraction and public statement clarifying the concerns.

3. **As a co-author on the paper (upon realizing the misconduct):**  
   - Publicly disavow the paper’s conclusions and request a formal retraction from The Lancet.  
   - Inform the university and medical regulatory authorities about the misconduct.  
   - Cooperate fully with investigations and provide truthful testimony regarding the study’s conduct.

4. **As a medical licensing board member (upon receiving complaints or evidence):**  
   - Initiate disciplinary proceedings against Wakefield for unethical research practices and patient harm.  
   - Suspend or revoke his medical license if investigations confirm misconduct.  
   - Publicize the findings to warn the medical community and public.

5. **As a journalist or investigator (like Brian Deer):**  
   - Obtain and analyze all relevant documents, medical records, and funding disclosures.  
   - Publish detailed exposés revealing the conflicts of interest, data falsification, and ethical breaches.  
   - Interview affected families, medical experts, and regulatory officials to provide a comprehensive account.

If I had to pick just one specific action in this context, I would:  
**As a university research ethics officer, immediately suspend Wakefield’s research and launch a formal investigation into the ethical violations, including unauthorized risky procedures on children and undisclosed conflicts of interest, while notifying medical regulatory authorities to protect patient safety and research integrity.**
