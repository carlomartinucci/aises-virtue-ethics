I would take the following specific actions:

1. Publicly issue a clear, detailed, and unequivocal statement admitting the full truth of what happened, correcting all inaccuracies from my original account, without minimizing or deflecting any part of the incident.

2. Arrange a formal in-person meeting with Brazilian officials and community leaders to apologize directly for the disrespect caused, acknowledging the impact on Brazilâ€™s reputation and expressing sincere remorse.

3. Volunteer to participate in a community outreach program in Brazil focused on youth education about respect, responsibility, and cultural sensitivity, dedicating at least 40 hours to demonstrate commitment beyond the required 20 hours of community service.

4. Work with my sponsors and the US Olympic Committee to develop and promote a campaign about accountability and honesty in sports, using my experience as a cautionary example to help restore trust.

5. Engage a professional media coach to help me communicate more responsibly in future interviews, ensuring I avoid exaggerations or misleading statements.

6. Personally reach out to the younger teammate who was underage and forbidden to leave the village, offering support and guidance to help them avoid similar mistakes.

7. Commit to regular updates on my progress in community service and public accountability efforts, sharing these transparently on social media and through press releases to rebuild public trust.
