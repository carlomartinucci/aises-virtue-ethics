If I were in a position of authority within MLB or an MLB team during or after the Astros sign-stealing scandal, here is a specific, concrete action I would take:

I would implement a mandatory, league-wide installation of real-time electronic monitoring systems in all MLB stadiums that automatically detect and flag suspicious electronic transmissions or unusual patterns of communication during games. This system would include:

1. Installing signal-jamming or detection devices in dugouts, video rooms, and other team areas to prevent unauthorized electronic communication.
2. Using AI-powered video and audio analysis software to monitor live feeds and dugout behavior for signs of illicit sign-stealing methods, such as banging on trash cans or unusual hand signals.
3. Creating a centralized MLB compliance team tasked with reviewing flagged incidents immediately during games and empowered to intervene or investigate further.
4. Requiring all teams to submit logs of electronic device usage during games, with random audits to ensure compliance.
5. Establishing clear, enforceable penalties for violations detected by this system, including suspensions, fines, and draft pick forfeitures.

By deploying this technology and compliance infrastructure, MLB would concretely reduce the possibility of electronic sign-stealing going undetected, deter teams from attempting such schemes, and restore confidence in the integrity of the game. This action goes beyond warnings and investigations by proactively preventing cheating through technological enforcement.
