I would immediately review all client files and communications related to Bucyrus-Erie, South Street, and Mikael Salovaara to identify any undisclosed relationships or conflicts of interest involving Milbank Tweed. Then, I would prepare and file a supplemental disclosure with the bankruptcy court detailing all connections between Milbank Tweed, South Street, and Salovaara that were omitted in the original filings. I would notify all affected parties, including BE, South Street, Salovaara, and JNL, about the oversight and provide them with the updated disclosures. Additionally, I would consult with an independent ethics counsel to assess the situation and develop a remediation plan, including offering to recuse Milbank Tweed from further representation if necessary. Finally, I would cooperate fully with any court or regulatory investigations, providing all requested documents and testimony to rectify the failure to disclose and mitigate potential legal consequences.
