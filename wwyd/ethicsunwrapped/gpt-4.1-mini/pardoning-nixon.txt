If I were President Ford in this context, the specific action I would take is to delay issuing a full and absolute pardon for Nixon until after a thorough, independent investigation into the Watergate scandal had been completed and the findings made public. To implement this, I would:

1. Publicly announce the formation of a bipartisan commission composed of respected legal experts, former judges, and former government officials to investigate Nixon’s involvement in Watergate.
2. Ensure the commission has full access to all relevant documents, tapes, and witnesses, and set a clear timeline for completing the investigation within a few months.
3. Communicate transparently with the American public throughout the investigation, providing regular updates to maintain trust.
4. Refrain from granting any form of pardon or immunity to Nixon until the commission’s report is finalized and released.
5. Based on the commission’s findings, decide on the appropriate legal or executive actions, which could include a pardon if warranted by the circumstances, but only after accountability has been established.

This approach would balance the need for national stability with the public’s demand for accountability and help rebuild trust in the executive branch.
