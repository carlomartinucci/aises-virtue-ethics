If I were a young GDR athlete in this situation during the 1960s-1980s, here is a specific action I would take:

I would secretly document and collect evidence of the doping program and its harmful effects on athletes, including my own health changes and those of my teammates. This would involve keeping a hidden journal detailing the pills administered, physical and psychological side effects, and any coercion or threats from coaches and doctors. I would also discreetly record conversations or gather testimonies from fellow athletes who share concerns.

Once I had sufficient evidence, I would find a trusted contact outside the GDR—such as a Western journalist, human rights organization, or Olympic anti-doping authority—and covertly pass this information to them, using clandestine means like smuggling notes or messages through visitors or diplomats. This would aim to expose the doping program internationally, increasing pressure on the GDR regime to stop the abuse and protect athletes’ health.

If direct exposure was too risky, I would at minimum refuse to take the pills, as the female swimmer did, and seek to connect with other dissenting athletes to build a support network, sharing information and strategies to resist doping while minimizing personal risk.
