If I were an editor at a news organization covering Robin Williams’s death, I would take the following concrete actions:

1. **Omit graphic details of the suicide method** from all published articles and broadcasts, including any coroner’s report specifics or law enforcement descriptions that reveal how the suicide was carried out.

2. **Focus reporting on Williams’s life, career, and struggles with mental health and addiction**, highlighting his openness about these issues as mentioned by his daughter Zelda, to foster public understanding and reduce stigma.

3. **Include information about suicide prevention resources** prominently in the article or segment, such as hotline numbers and websites, to provide support for vulnerable readers.

4. **Consult with mental health experts** before finalizing the story to ensure the coverage is sensitive and does not inadvertently encourage suicidal behavior.

5. **Respect the family’s privacy by not publishing any statements or images that they have not approved**, and avoid speculation about the circumstances beyond verified facts.

6. **Train reporters and editors on responsible suicide reporting guidelines**, such as those from the Press Complaints Commission or mental health organizations, to prevent similar issues in future coverage.

By implementing these steps, the coverage would be factual yet sensitive, minimizing harm while informing the public.
