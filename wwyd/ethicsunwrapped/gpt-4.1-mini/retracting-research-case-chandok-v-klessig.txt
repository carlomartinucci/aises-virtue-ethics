If I were Daniel Klessig or a senior member of the BTI research team at the time, here are the specific actions I would take:

1. **Document All Replication Attempts in Detail:** I would ensure that every attempt to replicate Chandok’s experiments is meticulously documented, including protocols followed, reagents used, equipment settings, and raw data collected. This documentation would be stored securely and made available for review.

2. **Request a Formal Meeting with Meena Chandok:** I would send a formal, written invitation to Chandok to return to the lab or collaborate remotely to repeat the experiments under supervision, emphasizing the importance of resolving the discrepancies for scientific integrity.

3. **Engage an Independent Expert:** If Chandok declines or is unavailable, I would commission an independent, external expert in plant cell biology to review the original data, methods, and replication attempts to provide an unbiased assessment.

4. **Notify the Institutional Research Integrity Officer:** I would formally report the replication failure and concerns to the BTI’s Research Integrity Officer to initiate an official inquiry or investigation, ensuring all procedures comply with institutional and federal guidelines.

5. **Communicate with the Journal Editors:** I would provide the journal *Cell* with a detailed report of the replication failures, the institutional investigation’s findings, and the steps taken to verify the results, requesting guidance on whether a correction, expression of concern, or retraction is warranted.

6. **Coordinate with Co-authors:** I would convene all co-authors to discuss the situation, share all evidence, and collectively decide on the appropriate course of action regarding the published paper, ensuring transparency and shared responsibility.

7. **Issue a Retraction if Necessary:** If replication attempts and investigations fail to validate the original findings, I would proceed with retracting the paper, submitting a clear, factual retraction notice to the journal that explains the reasons without assigning unproven blame.

8. **Prepare for Legal Challenges:** Anticipating potential legal action from Chandok, I would work with institutional legal counsel to ensure all communications and actions are documented, fact-based, and legally defensible.

9. **Implement Lab-wide Quality Control Measures:** To prevent future issues, I would establish stricter protocols for data verification, replication of key experiments before publication, and co-author accountability within the lab.

10. **Communicate Transparently with the Scientific Community:** I would present the case and its resolution at relevant conferences or in commentary articles to promote awareness of replication challenges and responsible research conduct.

By following these concrete steps, I would address the replication failure responsibly, protect the integrity of the scientific record, and manage the professional and legal risks involved.
