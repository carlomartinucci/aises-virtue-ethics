I would take the following concrete actions:

1. Compile a detailed, evidence-based report summarizing the case facts, including the original confessions, inconsistencies, lack of physical evidence, DNA exoneration, and subsequent confessions by Matias Reyes.

2. Submit this report to the New York State Bar Association’s Committee on Professional Conduct, requesting an investigation into potential prosecutorial and police misconduct, specifically focusing on the lead prosecutor and detective’s refusal to acknowledge exonerating evidence.

3. Contact journalists and documentary filmmakers who have covered wrongful convictions, providing them with the compiled evidence and urging them to produce updated investigative pieces highlighting the ongoing refusal of key officials to admit error, to increase public awareness and pressure for accountability.

4. File a formal complaint with the Innocence Project and other wrongful conviction advocacy groups, requesting their assistance in pushing for official reviews of the case and disciplinary actions against those who perpetuated the wrongful conviction.

5. Organize a petition directed at the New York City Council and the Mayor’s office demanding a public hearing on the case, focusing on systemic failures and the refusal of officials to accept the exoneration, to promote transparency and policy reforms.

6. If I were a legal professional, I would also seek to file a motion for a formal declaration of innocence or a court order requiring the prosecutor’s office to publicly acknowledge the wrongful conviction and exoneration, using the DNA evidence and Reyes’ confession as grounds.

Among these, if I had to pick just one, I would start by submitting a detailed, evidence-based complaint to the New York State Bar Association requesting an investigation into prosecutorial and police misconduct related to the case.
