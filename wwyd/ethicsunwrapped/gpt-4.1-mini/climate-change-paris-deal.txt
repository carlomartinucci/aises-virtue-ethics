I would take the following specific actions:

1. Advocate for and help establish a binding international monitoring and enforcement mechanism for the Paris Agreement targets. This would involve working with diplomats and international organizations to create a transparent system that tracks each countryâ€™s emissions reductions in real time, publicly reports progress, and imposes agreed-upon penalties or sanctions for countries that fail to meet their commitments.

2. Collaborate with policymakers in developing countries to design and implement green economic development programs that simultaneously promote poverty alleviation and low-carbon growth. For example, I would help develop projects that expand access to renewable energy (solar, wind) in rural areas, create green jobs in sustainable agriculture or clean technology sectors, and provide technical training to local workers.

3. Launch a public education campaign targeted at citizens in developed countries to increase awareness of their historical responsibility for climate change and the need for greater financial and technological support to developing nations. This campaign would include organizing community workshops, producing accessible multimedia content, and partnering with schools to integrate climate justice topics into curricula.

4. Work with economists and climate scientists to develop and promote policy proposals that internalize the long-term costs of carbon emissions, such as implementing a progressively increasing carbon tax with revenues earmarked for climate adaptation and mitigation projects benefiting vulnerable populations globally.

5. Facilitate multi-stakeholder dialogues that bring together representatives from developed and developing countries, indigenous groups, scientists, and civil society to negotiate fair burden-sharing arrangements that recognize historical emissions and current capabilities, ensuring that climate action plans are equitable and politically feasible.

If I had to pick just one action, I would focus on establishing the international monitoring and enforcement mechanism, as without accountability, voluntary targets are unlikely to be met.
