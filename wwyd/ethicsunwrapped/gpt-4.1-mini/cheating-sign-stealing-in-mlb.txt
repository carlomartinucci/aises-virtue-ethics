If I were a member of the Astros organization at the time when the “Codebreaker” system was being used or discovered, here is the specific action I would take:

I would immediately gather all relevant evidence and documentation related to the sign-stealing system, including the PowerPoint presentation, the Excel application, video footage, and any communications about the scheme. Then, I would report the entire situation directly to MLB’s Office of the Commissioner through the official whistleblower channels, providing full transparency and cooperation. I would also recommend that the team cease all use of electronic sign-stealing methods immediately and implement strict internal controls to prevent any recurrence.

This concrete step—documenting and reporting the violation to MLB promptly—would help address the wrongdoing directly and allow the league to investigate and take appropriate action.
