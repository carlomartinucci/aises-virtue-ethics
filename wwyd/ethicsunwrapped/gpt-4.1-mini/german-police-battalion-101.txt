If I were a member of Reserve Police Battalion 101 in July 1942, before the mass shootings began, I would take the following concrete action: I would explicitly inform my commander that I am not willing to participate in the shootings and request to be assigned to alternative duties such as guarding or transportation. I would then consistently refuse any orders to kill civilians, even if pressured by peers or superiors, and seek support from any fellow soldiers who also wish to opt out, forming a small group to reinforce our mutual decision. Additionally, I would document or memorize details of the orders and events to preserve evidence that could be used later to hold perpetrators accountable.
