I would take the following concrete steps:

1. Immediately schedule a supervision or consultation session with a trusted clinical supervisor or an ethics consultant to discuss my concerns about potential bias affecting treatment.

2. During the next client session, I would transparently and professionally disclose to the client that I have recognized a potential conflict between my personal beliefs and my ability to provide fully supportive counseling on this issue.

3. I would explicitly offer the client the option to continue working with me if he feels comfortable, or to be referred to another clinician who has experience and comfort in working with LGBTQ+ clients, ensuring the client’s autonomy in this decision.

4. If the client opts for referral, I would promptly provide a list of qualified, affirming therapists or agencies, and assist with the transfer process to ensure continuity of care without disruption.

5. Throughout this process, I would document all discussions, disclosures, and referrals in the client’s record to maintain professional accountability.

6. Independently, I would seek out continuing education or training focused on cultural competence and working with LGBTQ+ clients to better understand how to manage personal beliefs while providing ethical care in the future.
