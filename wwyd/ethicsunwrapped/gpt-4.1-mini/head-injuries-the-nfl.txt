I would take the following specific actions:

1. Advocate for and support the implementation of mandatory, independent, and longitudinal health monitoring programs for all NFL players, starting from their rookie year and continuing post-retirement. This would include regular neurocognitive testing, brain imaging advancements as they become available, and mental health evaluations to track potential long-term effects of head impacts.

2. Collaborate with NFL medical staff and researchers to develop and pilot advanced helmet technology that incorporates real-time impact sensors. These sensors would alert medical personnel immediately when a player experiences a potentially dangerous head impact, enabling prompt evaluation and removal from play if necessary.

3. Work with the NFL to revise game rules further to minimize high-risk plays, such as limiting full-contact practices during the season and off-season, and enforcing stricter penalties for helmet-to-helmet contact beyond current standards.

4. Launch an educational campaign targeted at players, coaches, and fans that clearly communicates the current scientific uncertainties and risks related to brain injuries in football, emphasizing informed consent for players and awareness for fans.

5. Support funding for large-scale, multi-institutional research studies that track players over decades, incorporating genetic, anatomical, and lifestyle factors to better understand individual susceptibility to concussions and CTE.

6. Encourage the NFL to establish a transparent, independent oversight committee composed of neurologists, neuropsychologists, former players, and ethicists to review injury data, research findings, and safety protocols annually, and publicly report on progress and challenges.

By taking these concrete steps, I would aim to improve player safety, advance scientific understanding, and foster informed decision-making among all stakeholders involved in professional football.
