If I were an employee or manager at Enron during this period and became aware of these manipulative trading schemes, I would take the following concrete actions:

1. **Document Evidence:** I would systematically collect and securely store detailed records of the specific trading strategies and transactions that manipulate the market or exploit regulatory loopholes, including emails, trade logs, and internal communications.

2. **Report Internally:** I would submit a formal, written report to Enron’s internal compliance or ethics department outlining the questionable practices, referencing the documented evidence, and requesting an internal investigation.

3. **Escalate to the Board or Audit Committee:** If internal compliance failed to act or dismissed the concerns, I would escalate the issue by sending a confidential letter to the company’s board of directors or audit committee members, emphasizing the potential legal and financial risks.

4. **Notify Regulators:** If internal channels proved ineffective or complicit, I would file a detailed whistleblower complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), providing the documented evidence of market manipulation.

5. **Seek Legal Counsel:** I would consult an independent attorney experienced in securities and energy law to understand my rights and protections as a whistleblower and to ensure my actions comply with legal requirements.

6. **Avoid Participating in Schemes:** I would refuse to engage in or facilitate any trading strategies that involve deception or manipulation, making clear to my supervisors that I will not participate in unethical conduct.

7. **Maintain Confidentiality:** While pursuing these steps, I would keep the information confidential to avoid tipping off colleagues involved in the schemes and to protect the integrity of any investigations.

By taking these concrete steps, I would actively work to expose and halt the unethical practices rather than passively enabling them.
