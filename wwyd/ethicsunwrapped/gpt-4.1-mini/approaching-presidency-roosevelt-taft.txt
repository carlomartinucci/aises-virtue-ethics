If I were in the position of President Taft facing Roosevelt’s expansionist actions and the ensuing political conflict, I would take the following specific steps:

1. **Commission a detailed legal review:** Direct the Attorney General to prepare a comprehensive legal analysis of Roosevelt’s key actions—such as the creation of national parks without state approval and the ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ with U.S. Steel—to clearly identify which actions exceeded constitutional or statutory authority.

2. **Publicly clarify the legal boundaries:** Hold a press conference or issue a formal statement outlining the legal limits of presidential power as I interpret them, using the Attorney General’s findings to explain why certain Roosevelt-era actions were overreaches, thereby educating the public and framing the debate on constitutional grounds.

3. **Initiate formal legal action where warranted:** Following the legal review, proceed with filing lawsuits or supporting congressional investigations against specific Roosevelt policies that lack legal basis, such as the anti-trust suit against U.S. Steel, to enforce the rule of law rather than rely on informal agreements.

4. **Engage Congress to codify limits:** Work with Republican congressional leaders to draft and promote legislation that clearly defines and limits executive power in areas where Roosevelt expanded it, such as environmental regulation and trust-busting, to prevent future unilateral presidential actions without legislative approval.

5. **Maintain evidence-based policy decisions:** Ensure that all executive actions and policy decisions are supported by documented evidence and legal authority, commissioning expert reports and economic analyses before acting, to contrast with Roosevelt’s more discretionary style and appeal to voters valuing rule of law.

6. **Communicate directly with party members:** Organize meetings with Republican Party leaders and delegates to explain my strict constructionist approach, emphasizing the importance of constitutional adherence and legal process, aiming to unify the party around a clear, principled stance ahead of the 1912 election.

By taking these concrete steps, I would assert the legal limits of presidential power, challenge Roosevelt’s expansionist policies through formal channels, and work to restore a clear constitutional framework within the Republican Party.
