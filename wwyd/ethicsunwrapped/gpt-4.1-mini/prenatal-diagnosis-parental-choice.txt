I would take the following specific action: organize and lead a community forum in my state that brings together medical professionals specializing in prenatal care, disability rights advocates (including individuals with Down syndrome), legal experts, and policymakers to discuss the implications of banning abortions based on Down syndrome diagnoses. I would coordinate with local hospitals and advocacy groups to secure speakers who can share firsthand medical, ethical, and lived-experience perspectives. The forum would aim to produce a detailed report summarizing the diverse viewpoints and potential impacts of such legislation, which I would then submit to my state legislature as a resource to inform their decision-making process. This action concretely addresses the complexity of the issue by fostering informed dialogue and providing lawmakers with nuanced, community-grounded information.
