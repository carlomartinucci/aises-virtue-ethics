I would take the following concrete actions:

1. Refuse to purchase or acquire any amber fossils originating from Myanmar’s Kachin State until there is clear, verifiable evidence that the supply chain is free from links to armed conflict and exploitative labor.

2. Collaborate with reputable institutions and organizations to develop and implement a certification system for ethically sourced amber fossils, including traceability from mine to market.

3. Advocate within the paleontological community and at scientific conferences for a moratorium on publishing research based on unverified Myanmar amber specimens, to reduce demand and incentivize ethical sourcing.

4. Support and fund alternative research methods, such as non-destructive imaging and studying amber fossils from other regions with transparent supply chains, to advance knowledge without contributing to conflict.

5. Engage with NGOs working on the ground in Kachin State to improve miners’ safety and labor conditions, providing resources or expertise to promote safer mining practices.

6. Publicly disclose the provenance of any amber fossils used in research or exhibitions, including detailed information about sourcing and ethical considerations, to increase transparency and accountability.

7. Lobby scientific journals and funding agencies to require ethical sourcing documentation for amber fossil-related submissions and grants.

By taking these specific steps, I would actively work to minimize harm while supporting responsible scientific inquiry.
