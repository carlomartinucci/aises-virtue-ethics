I would take the following specific actions in this context:

1. Coordinate with existing local and international health organizations (e.g., Doctors Without Borders, WHO) to identify the most urgent needs on the ground before deploying resources, ensuring that military efforts complement rather than duplicate or disrupt ongoing relief work.

2. Deploy military engineers to rapidly improve local infrastructure critical for epidemic control, such as water sanitation systems, roads for supply delivery, and communication networks, rather than focusing primarily on building new treatment centers.

3. Assign military medical personnel to support training and capacity-building for local healthcare workers in infection control protocols and safe patient handling, thereby strengthening local response capabilities.

4. Establish clear operational guidelines that strictly separate military roles from security enforcement to maintain the neutrality of humanitarian efforts and avoid any perception of militarization of health care.

5. Implement a real-time monitoring and evaluation system to track the impact of military interventions on Ebola case numbers and adjust strategies promptly based on data, avoiding unnecessary construction or deployment of resources once the epidemic is declining.

6. Facilitate community engagement initiatives led by trusted local leaders and health workers, with military support limited to logistics and security for safe gatherings, to build public trust and encourage cooperation with containment measures.

7. Prioritize the use of military logistics to expedite delivery of medical supplies and personal protective equipment to frontline health workers rather than focusing on direct patient care facilities that may be underutilized.

By focusing on these targeted, supportive roles, the military intervention would maximize its unique capabilities without overshadowing or undermining existing humanitarian efforts.
