I would locate and thoroughly review all available archival evidence related to Franz Stangl’s activities, including orders he received, correspondence, and testimonies from survivors and witnesses. Then, I would compile a detailed dossier documenting his direct and indirect involvement in the operations of the killing centers, emphasizing his role in organizing and managing mass murder. Next, I would collaborate with legal experts to prepare a comprehensive case file to support prosecution efforts against any remaining living collaborators or officials who facilitated these crimes. Finally, I would organize public educational programs and exhibitions using this evidence to ensure that the full extent of Stangl’s actions and the mechanisms of the Holocaust are clearly understood and remembered, preventing denial or minimization of these atrocities.
