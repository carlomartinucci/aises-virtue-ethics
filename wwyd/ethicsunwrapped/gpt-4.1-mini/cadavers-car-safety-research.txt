I would take the following specific actions:

1. Verify Consent Documentation: I would immediately request and review all consent forms and legal documentation from the families of the cadavers used, especially focusing on whether explicit consent was given for crash testing purposes, and whether the families were fully informed about the nature of the tests.

2. Conduct a Scientific Review: I would commission an independent panel of biomechanical and forensic experts to evaluate whether the data obtained from cadaver crash tests provides unique, irreplaceable insights that cannot be replicated by advanced crash test dummies or computer simulations.

3. Engage with Stakeholders: I would organize a public forum including representatives from the university, affected families, ethical experts, religious leaders, and automobile safety organizations to transparently discuss the research methods, findings, and ethical concerns.

4. Develop Alternative Testing Protocols: Based on the scientific review, I would initiate a research program to improve crash test dummy technology and computational modeling to reduce or eliminate the need for human cadaver testing.

5. Implement Policy Guidelines: I would work with legal and ethical committees to establish strict guidelines requiring informed consent for any future use of human cadavers in research, specifying the scope and limits of such use.

6. Communicate Findings Publicly: I would prepare a detailed report summarizing the scientific necessity, ethical considerations, and consent status, and make it publicly available to restore trust and inform policy decisions.

If I had to pick just one action, I would start by verifying the consent documentation from the families to ensure that the use of cadavers was legally and ethically authorized.
