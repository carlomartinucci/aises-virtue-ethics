I would implement a structured social media education and monitoring program for college athletes with the following concrete steps:

1. **Mandatory Social Media Workshop:** Organize a mandatory, in-person workshop at the start of each season where athletes receive detailed training on appropriate social media use, including examples of problematic posts (e.g., derogatory comments, posts about illegal benefits, or vulgar content). Provide clear guidelines on what is acceptable and what is not, tailored to the university’s values and NCAA rules.

2. **Social Media Policy Agreement:** Require each athlete to sign a detailed social media policy agreement that explicitly outlines prohibited behaviors (e.g., posting false information, sharing illegal benefits, vulgar language) and the consequences of violations, including potential suspension or dismissal from the team.

3. **Account Privacy Settings:** Assist athletes in setting their social media accounts to private and provide step-by-step instructions or direct support to ensure privacy settings are correctly applied.

4. **Use of Monitoring Software:** Implement a social media monitoring tool like UDiligence to scan athletes’ public posts for flagged keywords or content. Assign a designated compliance officer or staff member to review alerts daily and follow up promptly with athletes when concerning posts are detected.

5. **One-on-One Mentoring:** When a flagged post occurs, schedule a one-on-one meeting between the athlete and a mentor (e.g., coach or compliance officer) to discuss the post, its implications, and how to avoid similar issues in the future. Document these meetings for accountability.

6. **Positive Social Media Campaign:** Encourage athletes to use social media positively by creating official team hashtags and campaigns that promote community service, academic achievements, and team spirit. Feature exemplary posts on the team’s official channels to model good behavior.

7. **Recruiting Use Guidelines:** Train recruiting staff and coaches on how to use social media effectively and responsibly for communication with recruits, ensuring compliance with NCAA rules and maintaining professionalism.

By combining education, clear policies, privacy controls, monitoring, mentoring, and positive reinforcement, this approach balances the benefits of social media with the need to protect the university’s reputation and the athletes’ well-being.
