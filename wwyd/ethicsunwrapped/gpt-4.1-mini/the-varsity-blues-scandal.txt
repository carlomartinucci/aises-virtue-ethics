If I were in a position to respond concretely to this scenario, here is what I would do:

1. **If I were a parent approached by Rick Singer or aware of his scheme:**  
   - I would immediately refuse to participate in any fraudulent activities, including fabricating athletic profiles or making illicit donations.  
   - I would report the solicitation to the FBI or the Department of Education’s Office of Inspector General to help stop the scheme.  
   - I would focus on supporting my child’s genuine academic and extracurricular development, seeking legitimate college counseling services.  

2. **If I were a college admissions officer or administrator:**  
   - I would initiate a thorough audit of all recruited athletes, especially in non-revenue sports, verifying their athletic credentials and participation records.  
   - I would implement stricter controls and oversight on donations linked to athletic recruitment to detect and prevent quid pro quo arrangements.  
   - I would cooperate fully with law enforcement investigations and provide all requested documentation.  

3. **If I were a test administrator or proctor:**  
   - I would strictly adhere to standardized testing protocols, refusing any requests for special accommodations without proper documentation.  
   - I would report any suspicious behavior or attempts to bribe or manipulate test scores to the testing agency and law enforcement immediately.  

4. **If I were a journalist or investigator uncovering this scandal:**  
   - I would gather concrete evidence such as financial records, emails, and testimonies from involved parties.  
   - I would publish detailed reports exposing the mechanisms of the scheme to inform the public and pressure institutions to reform.  

5. **If I were a student unknowingly admitted through this scheme:**  
   - I would seek advice from a trusted mentor or legal counsel about the implications and consider voluntarily disclosing the truth to the college administration.  
   - I would commit to earning my place through honest academic effort going forward.  

In summary, the single most concrete action I would take if directly involved would be to report the scheme to the appropriate authorities immediately to prevent further fraud and protect the integrity of college admissions.
