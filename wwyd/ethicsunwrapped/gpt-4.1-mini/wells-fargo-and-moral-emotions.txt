If I were an employee at Wells Fargo during this scandal, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Document Evidence: I would meticulously collect and securely store any evidence of unethical or illegal practices I observe, such as emails, internal memos, or records of unauthorized account openings.

2. Report Internally with Specifics: I would submit a detailed, written complaint to the companyâ€™s compliance or ethics hotline, including dates, names, and descriptions of the fraudulent activities, ensuring I keep copies of all correspondence.

3. Seek External Whistleblower Protection: If internal reporting is ignored or leads to retaliation, I would contact external regulatory bodies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with my documented evidence.

4. Consult a Whistleblower Attorney: I would engage a lawyer experienced in whistleblower cases to understand my rights, protections, and potential legal actions, including how to protect myself from retaliation.

5. Avoid Participating in Fraud: I would refuse to engage in any fraudulent account openings or unauthorized customer enrollments, and explicitly communicate my refusal to supervisors in writing to create a record.

6. Support Affected Customers: Where possible, I would inform customers directly if I become aware their accounts have been opened without consent, guiding them on how to report and rectify the issue.

7. Maintain Personal Well-being: Recognizing the stress involved, I would seek counseling or support groups for employees affected by the toxic culture to manage mental health.

By taking these concrete steps, I would actively resist participation in the fraud, protect myself legally, and contribute to exposing and rectifying the wrongdoing.
