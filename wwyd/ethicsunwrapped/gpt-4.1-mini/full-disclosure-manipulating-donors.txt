After observing the interaction, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Immediately after the event, privately speak with Mary:** I would request a one-on-one conversation with Mary to express my concern that Robert was misled about the shelter’s clientele. I would say something like, “Mary, I noticed that Robert seemed to believe the shelter serves only American citizens. Since he is a major donor, do you think we should clarify the facts to ensure transparency?”

2. **Suggest sending a follow-up letter to Robert:** I would draft a clear, factual letter to Robert on Casa Tia Maria’s official letterhead, thanking him for his generous donation and gently clarifying the shelter’s mission and the demographics of the clients served, emphasizing the importance of supporting immigrants who are working hard to integrate and contribute to American society.

3. **Propose updating fundraising materials:** I would review the current fundraising materials and suggest revisions to ensure that the shelter’s mission and client base are clearly and accurately described, so future donors are fully informed.

4. **Document the incident:** I would write a brief report summarizing what I observed at the dinner, including Mary’s vague answers and Robert’s misunderstanding, and submit it to the development director or my internship supervisor to maintain a record and encourage organizational transparency.

5. **Reflect on my role:** I would prepare to be more proactive in future donor interactions by learning more about the shelter’s policies and client demographics so I can provide accurate information if asked.

If I had to pick just one action, I would choose to **draft and send the follow-up letter to Robert** clarifying the shelter’s mission and client base to ensure transparency and maintain donor trust.
