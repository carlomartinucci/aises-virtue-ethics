If I were in a position to act concretely in this context, specifically after Abramoff’s conviction and release, I would take the following action:

I would organize and lead a series of educational workshops and seminars targeted at Native American tribal leaders and their legal and financial advisors. These sessions would focus on:

1. How to conduct due diligence when hiring lobbyists and consultants, including verifying disclosures of conflicts of interest and fee structures.
2. Understanding the legal and ethical boundaries of lobbying and political advocacy.
3. Strategies for protecting tribal interests without falling prey to exploitative practices.
4. How to monitor and audit ongoing contracts with lobbyists to ensure transparency and accountability.

I would collaborate with reputable legal experts, ethics scholars, and former government officials who have experience in lobbying regulations to develop the curriculum. I would also create easy-to-understand guides and checklists for tribal clients to use when engaging with lobbyists.

This proactive educational initiative would empower tribes to avoid being exploited as Abramoff’s clients were, by equipping them with practical tools and knowledge to make informed decisions and hold lobbyists accountable.
