I would take the following specific actions:

1. Conduct a detailed supply chain audit focused on tin sourcing in Indonesia by hiring independent third-party inspectors with expertise in mining safety and labor rights to visit mines and verify working conditions firsthand.

2. Establish direct partnerships with verified ethical tin mines in Indonesia, bypassing middle-men where possible, to ensure traceability and accountability in the supply chain.

3. Implement a supplier code of conduct that explicitly prohibits child labor and unsafe working conditions, and require all suppliers and sub-suppliers to sign and comply with it as a condition for doing business.

4. Invest in training programs and safety equipment for miners at partner mines to reduce the risk of landslides and other hazards, collaborating with local NGOs and governments to improve mine safety standards.

5. Set up a transparent, publicly accessible online dashboard that tracks progress on improving working conditions and sourcing practices, updated quarterly with data from audits and supplier reports.

6. Launch a consumer awareness campaign explaining the complexities of ethical sourcing and the steps Apple is taking to improve conditions, encouraging customers to support these efforts by choosing products with ethically sourced components.

7. Allocate a portion of profits from iPhone sales to fund community development projects in mining regions, such as education programs to reduce child labor and infrastructure improvements to enhance safety.

8. Regularly review and update sourcing policies based on audit findings and stakeholder feedback, with a goal to increase the percentage of ethically sourced tin year over year until 100% is achieved.
