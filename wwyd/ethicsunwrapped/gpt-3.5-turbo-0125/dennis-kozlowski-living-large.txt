I would review the evidence presented during the trial to understand the basis of the charges against Dennis Kozlowski. This would involve examining the financial records, transactions, and communications related to the unauthorized bonuses and other financial misconduct. By conducting a thorough analysis of the evidence, I would aim to determine whether there was indeed criminal intent behind the actions taken by Kozlowski and whether the charges were justified based on the information available.
