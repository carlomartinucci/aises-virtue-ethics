If I were in a position to address the aftermath of the "Varsity Blues" scandal, I would work towards implementing stricter oversight and regulations within the college admissions process. This would involve collaborating with educational institutions to enhance transparency and accountability in admissions procedures. Additionally, I would advocate for increased monitoring of standardized testing centers to prevent fraudulent activities like those orchestrated by Rick Singer. By establishing clear protocols and conducting regular audits, we can help restore trust in the integrity of the college admissions system and ensure that all students have a fair chance at pursuing higher education based on their genuine abilities and achievements.
