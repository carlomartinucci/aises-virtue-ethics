Given the findings from the studies conducted by psychologists Nina Mazar and Chen-Bo Zhong, I would recommend conducting further research to explore the underlying mechanisms behind the observed behavior. Specifically, I would suggest conducting in-depth interviews or surveys with consumers who purchase green products to better understand their motivations, values, and attitudes towards ethical consumption. This qualitative research could provide valuable insights into how individuals perceive their own ethical behavior in relation to their purchasing decisions and shed light on the potential psychological processes at play. Additionally, I would propose designing experimental studies to test interventions that could mitigate the negative effects of moral licensing associated with green consumer behavior, such as implementing prompts or reminders to encourage continued ethical behavior even after purchasing green products. By gaining a deeper understanding of consumer behavior in this context and testing potential interventions, we can work towards promoting more consistent ethical conduct among individuals who purchase green products.
