I would work to raise awareness about the case and the injustice faced by the Central Park 5. This could involve organizing public events such as panel discussions, film screenings, or rallies to educate the community about the wrongful convictions and systemic issues that led to this outcome. I would also collaborate with advocacy groups, legal experts, and community leaders to push for reforms in police practices, interrogation techniques, and the criminal justice system to prevent similar injustices from happening in the future. Additionally, I would support efforts to hold accountable those who played a role in perpetuating the wrongful convictions, such as the lead prosecutor, head detective, and others who have refused to acknowledge the innocence of the Central Park 5.
