If I were in this situation, I would ensure full transparency and disclosure of all potential conflicts of interest to the bankruptcy judge when filing documents under oath on behalf of BE. Specifically, I would thoroughly review all relationships and connections that Milbank Tweed has with other parties involved in the bankruptcy proceedings, such as South Street and Salovaara, and disclose them accurately to the court.

I would make it a priority to disclose any interactions, representations, or financial relationships that could be perceived as conflicting with our role as BE's counsel to avoid any appearance of impropriety. It is crucial to maintain the integrity of the legal process and ensure that all parties involved are aware of any potential conflicts that may arise.

By being transparent and forthcoming about these connections, I would aim to uphold the ethical standards of the legal profession and prevent any misunderstandings or legal repercussions that could arise from a failure to disclose relevant information to the court.
