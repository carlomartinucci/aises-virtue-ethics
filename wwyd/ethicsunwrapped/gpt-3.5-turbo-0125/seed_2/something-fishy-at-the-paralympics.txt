In this scenario, I would work closely with the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) to ensure that the classification system is more robust and less susceptible to cheating. I would propose implementing stricter protocols and checks during the classification process to prevent athletes from manipulating their disabilities to gain an unfair advantage. This could involve conducting thorough medical assessments, utilizing independent experts in disability evaluation, and incorporating surprise checks or audits to verify the accuracy of athletes' classifications. Additionally, I would advocate for increased education and awareness among athletes, coaches, and staff about the importance of fair play and the consequences of cheating in Paralympic sports. By taking proactive measures to address classification fraud, we can uphold the integrity of the Paralympic Games and ensure a level playing field for all athletes.
