In this scenario, I would take the following specific steps:

1. Initiate a comprehensive review of the bank's sales practices and employee incentives to identify any unethical or fraudulent behavior.
2. Implement a new system of checks and balances to ensure that all customer accounts are opened with proper authorization and consent.
3. Provide support and resources for employees who have raised concerns or blown the whistle on fraudulent activities, including protection from retaliation.
4. Collaborate with regulatory authorities to address any legal violations and work towards resolving any financial penalties or settlements.
5. Conduct a thorough investigation into all allegations of wrongdoing, including improper changes to mortgage loans, unauthorized insurance policies, and excessive fees charged to customers.
6. Develop and implement a robust compliance program to prevent future misconduct and ensure ethical behavior throughout the organization.
7. Communicate openly and transparently with customers, shareholders, and the public about the steps being taken to address the issues and rebuild trust in the bank.
8. Hold senior executives, including the CEO, accountable for their role in the scandal and take appropriate disciplinary action, including possible termination, if warranted.
