I would immediately report the unethical practices to the appropriate authorities within the Veterans Administration, such as the Inspector General's office, detailing the specific instances of manipulating wait times and falsifying records.

Additionally, I would offer to cooperate fully with any investigations and provide any further information or assistance needed to ensure accountability and transparency in addressing the issue.
