In this scenario, I would advise Rashard Mendenhall to carefully consider the potential implications of his social media posts before sharing them online. Specifically, I would recommend that he:

1. Take a moment to reflect on the sensitivity of the topic at hand, especially when it involves a significant event like the death of Osama Bin Laden.
2. Consider the diverse perspectives and reactions that his audience may have to his posts, particularly given his status as a public figure.
3. Consult with a trusted advisor or PR professional to review his posts before sharing them to ensure they are respectful and considerate of different viewpoints.
4. Craft his messages thoughtfully to convey his intended message clearly and avoid misunderstandings or misinterpretations.
5. Be prepared to address any backlash or criticism that may arise from his posts by responding in a calm and respectful manner.

By following these steps, Mendenhall can navigate the challenges of social media as a public figure more effectively and responsibly.
