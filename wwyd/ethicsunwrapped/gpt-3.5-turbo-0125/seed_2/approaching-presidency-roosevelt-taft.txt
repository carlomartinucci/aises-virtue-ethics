In this scenario, if I were a member of President Taft's administration, I would recommend conducting a thorough legal review of the actions taken by President Roosevelt during his time in office. This review would aim to identify any instances where Roosevelt may have overstepped his executive authority as defined by the Constitution and existing laws. The findings of this review would then be used to inform President Taft's decisions on whether to maintain, revise, or reverse any of Roosevelt's policies or actions that are deemed to be legally questionable. Additionally, I would advise President Taft to prioritize adherence to legal boundaries and precedents in his decision-making process to avoid further conflicts within the Republican Party and ensure that his actions are grounded in a clear legal framework.
