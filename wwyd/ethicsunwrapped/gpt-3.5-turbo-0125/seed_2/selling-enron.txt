If I were in this scenario, I would immediately report the unethical and illegal business practices at Enron to the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). I would provide detailed information about the schemes mentioned in the book, such as submitting false demand schedules, filing imaginary transmission schedules, and engaging in strategies like Get Shorty to manipulate the energy markets.

I would also cooperate fully with any investigations and provide any evidence or documentation that could help uncover the extent of Enron's fraudulent activities. Additionally, I would encourage other employees who are aware of these practices to come forward and report them as well.

Furthermore, I would ensure that all communication and actions taken in response to these revelations are transparent and documented to ensure accountability and prevent any attempts to cover up the wrongdoing. It is crucial to prioritize the protection of customers and the integrity of the energy markets by holding those responsible for these actions accountable.
