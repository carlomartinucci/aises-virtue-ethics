If I were a part of the Houston Astros organization during the time of the sign-stealing scheme, my specific actions would include:

1. Refusing to participate in any way in the implementation or continuation of the sign-stealing scheme, regardless of pressure from superiors or peers.
  
2. Reporting the sign-stealing activities to the appropriate authorities within the organization, such as the Astros' owner Jim Crane, or directly to Major League Baseball, to ensure that the issue is properly addressed and investigated.

3. If I had direct knowledge of individuals involved in the scheme, such as General Manager Jeff Luhnow, manager AJ Hinch, or players like Carlos Beltran and Alex Cora, I would disclose this information truthfully and cooperate fully with any investigations.

4. Respecting the rules and regulations set by Major League Baseball and upholding the integrity of the game by not engaging in any form of cheating or unethical behavior.

5. Supporting the efforts to hold those responsible for the sign-stealing scheme accountable, even if it meant potentially facing backlash or repercussions within the organization.
