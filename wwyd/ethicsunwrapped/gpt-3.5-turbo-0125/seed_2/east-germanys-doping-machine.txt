As a coach or medical professional involved in the GDR's systematic doping program for athletes, I would immediately stop administering performance-enhancing drugs to the athletes under my care. I would refuse to continue participating in this unethical and harmful practice that puts the athletes' health and well-being at risk. I would also report the doping program to the appropriate authorities and seek assistance in providing support and care for the affected athletes who have been subjected to these dangerous substances. Additionally, I would advocate for transparency and accountability within the sports community to prevent such abuses from happening in the future.
