I would work with the Starbucks management team to implement comprehensive training programs on diversity, inclusion, and unconscious bias for all employees at every store location. This training would be designed to raise awareness of implicit bias and provide tools and strategies for employees to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for all customers. Additionally, I would collaborate with community leaders and organizations to develop initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion in the local community, fostering positive relationships and understanding between Starbucks and its customers.
