Given the scenario, I would recommend implementing a social media policy specifically tailored for college athletes. This policy should include guidelines on appropriate online behavior, such as refraining from posting derogatory, vulgar, or potentially damaging content. It should also outline consequences for violating the policy, providing clarity on how breaches will be addressed. Additionally, I would suggest conducting social media education sessions for athletes to raise awareness about the impact of their online presence and how to navigate social media responsibly. Regular monitoring of athletes' social media accounts using software like UDiligence could help identify problematic posts early and facilitate timely interventions.
