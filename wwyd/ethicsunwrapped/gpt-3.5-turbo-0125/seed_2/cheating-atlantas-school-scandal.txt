I would have refused the principal's request to change students' answers on the standardized tests, as it goes against ethical standards and integrity in education. Instead, I would have sought alternative ways to support my students, such as providing additional tutoring, implementing targeted interventions, and advocating for additional resources to help improve their performance. Additionally, I would have raised my concerns about the pressure to cheat with the school administration and sought support from educational authorities to address the underlying issues affecting the school.
