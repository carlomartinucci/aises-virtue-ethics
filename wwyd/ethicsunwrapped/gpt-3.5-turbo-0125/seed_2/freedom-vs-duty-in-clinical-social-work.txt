I would suggest that the social worker consult with a supervisor or ethics committee within their organization to discuss the situation and seek guidance on how to proceed. It is important for the social worker to consider the best interests of the client and ensure that they receive appropriate care and support, even if it means transferring the client to another therapist who can provide unbiased treatment. The social worker should also reflect on how their personal beliefs may be impacting their ability to effectively work with the client and explore strategies to manage any potential biases that could affect their professional practice.
