I would conduct a thorough investigation into Apple's supply chain to verify the claims made by critics about dangerous working conditions in the mines that source tin for their products. This investigation would involve gathering data, conducting site visits, and interviewing workers to assess the current situation accurately. Additionally, I would review Apple's annual reports on their work with suppliers and labor practices to understand the progress they have made and identify areas that still need improvement. Based on this information, I would develop a comprehensive action plan to address any ethical issues found, including working with Apple to implement changes in their supply chain practices to ensure the safety and well-being of workers in the mines.
