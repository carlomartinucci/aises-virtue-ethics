If I were in this scenario, I would work on educating and raising awareness about the importance of compensating artists and creators for their work. I would collaborate with industry stakeholders, including artists, record labels, streaming platforms, and tech companies, to develop fair compensation models that benefit all parties involved. This could involve organizing discussions, workshops, and campaigns to promote a better understanding of copyright laws, intellectual property rights, and the impact of digital piracy on artists' livelihoods. Additionally, I would advocate for policies and agreements that prioritize fair compensation for artists in the digital music landscape, ensuring that their creative efforts are valued and protected.
