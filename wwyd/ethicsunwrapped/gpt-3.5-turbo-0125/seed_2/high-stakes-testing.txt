I would conduct a comprehensive review of the current standardized testing system in place, considering feedback from educators, parents, and students. This review would involve analyzing the impact of high stakes testing on minority communities and assessing whether the current testing methods are truly effective in measuring student achievement. I would also evaluate alternative assessment methods that could provide a more holistic view of student learning and progress, beyond just standardized test scores. Additionally, I would work with stakeholders to develop a plan for addressing the concerns raised by opponents of high stakes testing, while still ensuring some form of accountability in education. Engaging in open dialogue and collaboration with all parties involved would be crucial in finding a balanced approach that benefits all students.
