Given the conflicting views on bullfighting, I would first conduct thorough research to understand the full scope of the issue, including the cultural, ethical, and economic aspects of bullfighting. I would then seek out expert opinions from various stakeholders, including animal rights activists, bullfighters, cultural historians, and veterinarians, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the implications of bullfighting.

Next, I would explore alternative forms of traditional cultural expression that do not involve harm to animals, in order to promote cultural heritage while respecting animal welfare. This could include supporting events that celebrate local traditions and customs in a more animal-friendly manner.

Additionally, I would work with local authorities and organizations to implement regulations and guidelines aimed at improving animal welfare standards in bullfighting, such as ensuring the humane treatment of bulls before, during, and after the fight. This could involve advocating for stricter enforcement of existing animal protection laws or proposing new legislation to address specific concerns related to bullfighting practices.

Overall, my approach would be to find a balanced solution that respects cultural traditions while also prioritizing the well-being of animals involved in bullfighting.
