In this scenario, I would take the following specific action: I would reach out to Asian American actors and advocacy groups to listen to their perspectives and understand their concerns regarding the casting of Jonathan Pryce as the Eurasian character in Miss Saigon. I would engage in open dialogue to gain insights into their experiences and how they feel about the impact of such casting decisions on the representation of Asian actors in the performing arts industry. This would help me better grasp the nuances of the issue and consider potential ways to address the concerns raised by the community affected by such casting decisions.
