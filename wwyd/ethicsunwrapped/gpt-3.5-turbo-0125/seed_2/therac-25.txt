I would immediately report all known safety issues and incidents related to the Therac-25 machine to the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the FDA, to ensure that the machines are taken out of service and thoroughly investigated. I would also cooperate fully with any investigations and provide all necessary information and documentation to assist in determining the root causes of the accidents. Additionally, I would work with the engineering and software development teams to implement comprehensive safety features, conduct thorough testing of the software, and ensure that all necessary mechanical interlocks are in place to prevent future accidents. Finally, I would advocate for greater transparency and accountability within the company to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
