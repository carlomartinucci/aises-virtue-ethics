I would reach out to Christina Fallin and Pink Pony to express my concerns about the cultural appropriation in the photo wearing the Plains headdress. I would suggest that they engage with Native American communities to better understand the significance and sacredness of the headdress and how their actions could be perceived as disrespectful. Additionally, I would recommend that they collaborate with Native American artists and activists to find more appropriate ways to show their appreciation for Native American culture through their music and promotional materials.
