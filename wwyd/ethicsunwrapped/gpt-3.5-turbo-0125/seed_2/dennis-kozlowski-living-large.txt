I would conduct a thorough review of all financial records and documentation related to the unauthorized bonuses and other financial transactions in question during Kozlowski's tenure as CEO at Tyco International. This review would involve examining the board meeting minutes, financial statements, emails, memos, and any other relevant documents to determine the authorization and approval process for these transactions. I would also analyze any internal controls and policies in place at the time to prevent and detect such misconduct. Additionally, I would interview key personnel involved in the decision-making process to gain further insights into the circumstances surrounding these transactions.
