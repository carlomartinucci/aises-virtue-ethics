I would review the specific district policies and guidelines regarding the use of potentially sensitive or controversial materials in the classroom. I would also gather feedback from students, parents, and other staff members about their perspectives on the lesson and its impact. Additionally, I would facilitate a meeting with Alan Barron, the assistant principal, and other relevant stakeholders to discuss the concerns raised and find a resolution that addresses any misunderstandings or misinterpretations. Finally, I would offer support to Alan Barron as he transitions back to the classroom and ensure that he has the resources needed to address any potential repercussions from the situation.
