I would review the reforms instituted by UNC in response to the academic fraud allegations to ensure that higher governance standards, accountability for student-athlete support programs, and classroom and coursework audits are effectively implemented and monitored. I would also collaborate with relevant stakeholders, such as academic advisors, faculty, and administrators, to establish and maintain transparent academic policies and procedures to prevent similar fraudulent practices in the future. Additionally, I would prioritize academic integrity and student welfare by promoting a culture of ethical conduct and educational excellence within the university community.
