I would express concern about the ethical implications of the campaign's approach to promoting pet adoption. I would schedule a meeting with the campaign team and agency leadership to discuss the potential negative impact of framing pet ownership solely based on utilitarian purposes rather than love and companionship. I would suggest exploring alternative messaging strategies that focus on the emotional bond between pets and owners to ensure that the campaign upholds the values of promoting responsible pet ownership and animal welfare. Additionally, I would recommend conducting further research to gather feedback from animal welfare experts and stakeholders in the community to inform any necessary adjustments to the campaign.
