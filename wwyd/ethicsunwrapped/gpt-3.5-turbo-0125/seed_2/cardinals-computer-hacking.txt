I would ensure that Correa receives appropriate counseling and support to understand the consequences of his actions and to reflect on the ethical implications of hacking into the Astros' internal database. I would work with him to develop a clear understanding of the harm caused by his behavior and encourage him to take responsibility for his actions. Additionally, I would facilitate educational opportunities for Correa to learn more about cybersecurity, data ethics, and professional conduct to prevent similar incidents in the future.
