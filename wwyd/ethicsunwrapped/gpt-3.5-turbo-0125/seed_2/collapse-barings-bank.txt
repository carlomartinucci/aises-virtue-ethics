If I were a compliance officer at Barings Bank during the events involving Nick Leeson, I would have implemented a more robust system of checks and balances to prevent such a catastrophic failure.

Specifically, I would have:

1. Implemented regular and thorough internal audits of trading activities, with a focus on verifying the accuracy and legitimacy of trading records and positions.
2. Established a clear reporting structure that required traders like Leeson to report any losses immediately, without fear of reprisal, and set up a system for escalation if necessary.
3. Enforced strict segregation of duties to prevent a single individual from having unchecked control over both trading activities and back-office functions.
4. Conducted regular stress tests and scenario analyses to assess the bank's exposure to various market risks and ensure that appropriate risk management strategies were in place.
5. Improved communication and oversight between the Singapore office and headquarters in London to ensure that senior management was aware of the risks being taken by traders like Leeson.

By taking these specific actions, I believe that the collapse of Barings Bank due to Nick Leeson's actions could have been prevented or mitigated.
