I would approach Mary privately after the fundraising dinner and express my concerns about the misperception Robert had regarding Casa Tia Maria's clients. I would suggest to Mary that it is important to be transparent and provide accurate information to donors to ensure they understand the organization's mission and who it serves. I would recommend that in future interactions with donors, we make it clear that the shelter primarily serves Central American immigrants who are looking for housing and employment opportunities in the United States. This way, donors like Robert can make informed decisions about supporting Casa Tia Maria based on accurate information.
