I would recommend that President Trump reconsider his decision to pardon Scooter Libby, given the potential risks to national security and the operations of the CIA highlighted by Valerie Plame. In light of the concerns raised by Plame and the importance of maintaining trust and collaboration between the president and the intelligence community, it would be prudent for President Trump to consult with relevant experts within the Justice Department and the intelligence agencies before making such a significant decision. Additionally, I would suggest that President Trump publicly address these concerns and provide transparency regarding the rationale behind the pardon, in order to reassure the public and safeguard national security interests.
