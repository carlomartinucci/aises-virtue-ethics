I would convene a meeting involving the hospital staff, the patient's son who is the guardian, and any other relevant family members to discuss the situation openly and transparently. During this meeting, I would ensure that everyone understands the potential benefits and risks of the new drug, as well as the concerns related to the patient's paranoid symptoms and fear of being poisoned.

I would encourage a thorough discussion to explore alternative options that could address the patient's paranoia while respecting his autonomy as much as possible. This could involve seeking input from mental health professionals, ethicists, and legal advisors to ensure that the proposed course of action aligns with ethical guidelines and legal requirements.

Ultimately, I would work towards finding a solution that balances the need to provide effective treatment for the patient with the principles of autonomy and informed consent. This may involve seeking a court order or additional expert opinions to make a well-informed decision that prioritizes the patient's well-being while also upholding ethical standards.
