If I were in a position to address the aftermath of the "Varsity Blues" scandal, I would work to ensure that the affected students receive fair treatment and support in light of the fraudulent circumstances surrounding their admissions. One specific action I would take is to establish a task force comprised of education professionals, counselors, and mental health experts to assess the impact on these students and provide appropriate resources for their academic and emotional well-being. This task force would work to identify any academic support needed, such as tutoring or counseling, to help these students navigate their college experience with integrity and confidence despite the unethical actions that led to their admission.
