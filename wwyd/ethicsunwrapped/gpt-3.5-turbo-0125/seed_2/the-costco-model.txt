Given the scenario, I would conduct a detailed analysis comparing the business models of Costco, Walmart, and Target to identify specific practices and strategies that contribute to Costco's success in treating employees well. This analysis would involve examining factors such as wage levels, benefits packages, employee training programs, turnover rates, and productivity levels. I would also investigate how Costco's focus on simplicity and efficiency in its operations impacts its ability to provide fair treatment to employees. By gathering this specific data and insights, I could provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between company practices, employee treatment, and overall business success.
