I would investigate the process through which the cadavers were obtained for the research at Heidelberg University and Wayne State University. This investigation would involve reviewing documentation to determine if the cadavers were sourced ethically and if proper consent was obtained from the deceased individuals or their families. If it is found that the cadavers were obtained without appropriate consent or through unethical means, I would recommend disciplinary action against the researchers and institutions involved. Additionally, I would work towards implementing stricter regulations and guidelines for the ethical use of human cadavers in research to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.
