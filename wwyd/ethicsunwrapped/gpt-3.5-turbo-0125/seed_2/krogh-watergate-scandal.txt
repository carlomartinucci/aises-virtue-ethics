If I were in Egil "Bud" Krogh's position during the meeting where the break-in was proposed and approved, I would interrupt the discussion and raise concerns about the legality and morality of the operation. I would emphasize the importance of upholding the law and ethical standards in any actions taken by the administration. I would question the necessity of the break-in and advocate for exploring alternative ways to address the issue without resorting to illegal activities. If necessary, I would seek guidance from legal experts or ethics advisors to ensure that the proposed actions align with legal and ethical principles.
