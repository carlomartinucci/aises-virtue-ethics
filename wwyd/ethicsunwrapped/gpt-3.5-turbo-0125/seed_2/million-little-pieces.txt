If I were in this situation, I would recommend that Doubleday issue a public statement acknowledging the inaccuracies and fabrications in James Frey's book, A Million Little Pieces. The statement should express regret for marketing the book as a memoir when it contained elements of fiction. Doubleday should offer refunds to readers who feel deceived by the misrepresentation of the book's genre and content. Additionally, Doubleday should pledge to review and revise their editorial processes to ensure that future publications are accurately categorized and labeled to avoid similar controversies. This action would help restore trust in the publishing industry and address the concerns raised by the public and critics.
