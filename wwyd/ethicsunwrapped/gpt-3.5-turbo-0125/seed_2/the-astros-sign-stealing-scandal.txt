I would report the sign-stealing scheme conducted by the Houston Astros to the appropriate authorities within Major League Baseball (MLB), providing all the evidence available, including the details of the Codebreaker algorithm, the use of live game feeds, the trash can banging system, and the involvement of players, coaches, and management in the scheme. This information would be essential for the MLB to conduct a thorough investigation and take appropriate disciplinary actions against those involved in the cheating scandal.
