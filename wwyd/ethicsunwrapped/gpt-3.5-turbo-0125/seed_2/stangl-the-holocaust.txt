I would acknowledge the horrific actions committed by Franz Stangl during the Holocaust, recognize the pain and suffering he caused to countless individuals and their families, and express my deepest condolences to all those affected by his actions. I would also emphasize the importance of remembering the victims and ensuring that such atrocities never happen again. Additionally, I would support ongoing efforts to educate others about the Holocaust and promote tolerance and understanding among different communities.
