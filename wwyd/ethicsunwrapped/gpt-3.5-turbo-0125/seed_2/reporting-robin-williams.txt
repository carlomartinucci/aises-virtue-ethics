Given the scenario, I would prioritize the ethical principle of respecting the privacy and dignity of the deceased and their family. In this context, I would take the specific action of refraining from reporting graphic and unnecessary details about Robin Williams' suicide. Instead, I would focus on reporting the broader context of mental health issues, suicide prevention resources, and the importance of seeking help. This way, I would aim to honor the memory of Robin Williams while also being sensitive to the impact of media coverage on his family and the public perception of suicide.
