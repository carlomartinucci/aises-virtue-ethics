I would conduct a comprehensive environmental impact assessment of the proposed offshore drilling in the Arctic. This assessment would involve studying the potential risks and consequences of drilling activities on the local ecosystem, wildlife, and indigenous communities. Additionally, I would analyze the feasibility and effectiveness of mitigation measures to address any potential environmental harm caused by offshore drilling. This assessment would provide crucial information to make an informed decision on the environmental impact of expanding drilling operations in the Arctic.
