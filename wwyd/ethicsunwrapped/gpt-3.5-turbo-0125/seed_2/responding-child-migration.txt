I would advocate for a balanced approach that prioritizes the safety and well-being of the unaccompanied minors while also addressing the root causes of the crisis. This would involve working with relevant stakeholders such as human rights organizations, local communities, and international partners to ensure that the children are provided with adequate care and support. Additionally, I would support efforts to increase the capacity of immigration judges to process asylum claims efficiently and fairly. It is crucial to recognize the humanitarian nature of the crisis and work towards solutions that uphold the rights of the vulnerable children involved.
