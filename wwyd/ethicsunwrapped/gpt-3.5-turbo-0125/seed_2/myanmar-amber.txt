As a researcher in the field of paleontology, I would first ensure that any decision to acquire or study amber fossils from Myanmar is made after careful consideration of the ethical implications. I would seek to collaborate with local experts and organizations to gain a better understanding of the specific social and environmental impacts associated with the extraction of these fossils.

In order to address the ethical concerns related to the funding of armed groups through the sale of amber, I would explore alternative sourcing options that prioritize transparency and ethical labor practices. This could involve working with reputable suppliers who adhere to strict ethical standards and engage in fair trade practices.

Additionally, I would advocate for greater awareness within the scientific community about the ethical dilemmas surrounding the acquisition of Myanmar's amber fossils. By engaging in open discussions and sharing information about the risks and benefits involved, we can collectively work towards developing best practices that prioritize both scientific advancement and ethical responsibility.

Lastly, I would support initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable mining practices and improving working conditions for miners in Kachin State. By advocating for stronger regulations and oversight, we can help mitigate the negative impacts of amber extraction on local communities and the environment.

Overall, my approach would be to engage proactively with stakeholders, seek out responsible sourcing options, and advocate for ethical practices in order to navigate the complex ethical landscape surrounding the study of Myanmar's amber fossils.
