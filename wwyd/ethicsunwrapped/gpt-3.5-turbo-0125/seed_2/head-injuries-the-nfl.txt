As a researcher in this field, I would focus on conducting further studies to better understand the long-term effects of football-related head injuries. This could involve investigating the factors that contribute to the development of CTE, potential genetic predispositions, and methods to accurately diagnose brain injuries in living players. By expanding our knowledge in these areas, we can provide more concrete data to inform decisions around player safety and potential interventions to minimize the risks associated with playing football.
