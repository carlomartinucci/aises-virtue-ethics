Given the scenario, I would take the specific action of analyzing the terms and conditions of various digital music platforms to determine how they compensate artists for streaming their music. This analysis would involve researching the payment structures and policies of platforms like iTunes, Pandora, and others to understand how artists are remunerated for their work. By gaining this insight, I could provide informed recommendations to artists on which platforms may offer fair compensation for their music and help them make informed decisions about where to distribute their work.
