I would work to understand the specific psychological and social factors that influenced the behavior of the reserve policemen in Reserve Police Battalion 101. This would involve conducting in-depth interviews with survivors or descendants of the battalion members to gain insights into their motivations and thought processes. Additionally, I would analyze historical documents and records related to the battalion to uncover any additional contextual details that could shed light on why the majority of the men chose to participate in the mass killings despite having the option to opt out. By gaining a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics at play, I could potentially contribute to the broader understanding of how seemingly ordinary individuals can become willing participants in acts of extreme violence under certain circumstances.
