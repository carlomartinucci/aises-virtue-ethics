I would ensure that the story of the Central Park 5 is shared widely and accurately to raise awareness about the issues of false confessions, wrongful convictions, and racial bias in the criminal justice system. This could be done through various means such as organizing public talks, panel discussions, creating educational materials, and engaging with the media to highlight these injustices. Additionally, I would advocate for reforms in police interrogation practices and legal procedures to prevent similar miscarriages of justice from happening in the future.
