In the context of the conflicting views on bullfighting, I would engage in facilitating open and respectful dialogue between both sides of the debate. This could involve organizing public forums, panel discussions, or debates where proponents and opponents of bullfighting can present their arguments, share their perspectives, and engage in constructive conversation.

By providing a platform for meaningful dialogue, I would aim to foster understanding, empathy, and mutual respect among individuals with differing views on bullfighting. This approach can help participants appreciate the complexities of the issue, acknowledge each other's concerns, and potentially find common ground or areas for compromise.

Furthermore, I would encourage the inclusion of experts from various fields such as animal welfare, cultural studies, ethics, and law to provide diverse insights and information to enrich the discussions. This multidisciplinary approach can help participants gain a more comprehensive understanding of the implications of bullfighting from different angles.

Overall, my focus would be on promoting constructive dialogue as a means to address the contentious issue of bullfighting and work towards finding solutions or alternative approaches that respect both cultural traditions and animal welfare concerns.
