I would acknowledge the horrifying actions committed by Franz Stangl during the Holocaust and recognize the immense suffering and loss of life caused by his leadership at the killing centers. I would also ensure that his story is remembered as a cautionary tale of how individuals can become complicit in atrocities through their actions, even if they see themselves as mere administrators.

Furthermore, I would emphasize the importance of holding individuals accountable for their roles in such heinous crimes, regardless of their justifications or claims of innocence. It is crucial to learn from history and ensure that such atrocities are never repeated.

Finally, I would express my condolences to the victims and their families, honoring their memory and the resilience of those who survived such horrors.
