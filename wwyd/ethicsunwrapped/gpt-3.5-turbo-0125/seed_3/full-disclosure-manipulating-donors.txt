I would approach Mary privately after the fundraising dinner and express my concerns about the miscommunication that occurred with Robert. I would suggest that it is important to ensure that donors have an accurate understanding of the organization's mission and the population it serves. I would propose that in the future, we make an effort to clarify any misconceptions to donors to maintain transparency and integrity in our fundraising efforts. Additionally, I would recommend discussing strategies on how to communicate effectively with potential donors to avoid similar misunderstandings in the future.
