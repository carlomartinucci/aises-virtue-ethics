I would first acknowledge and recognize my own religious beliefs and potential biases that could impact my ability to provide unbiased treatment to the client. I would then consult with a trusted supervisor or colleague to discuss the ethical dilemma and seek guidance on how to proceed in the best interest of the client. It would be important to explore whether my personal beliefs could be set aside to provide effective and nonjudgmental therapy to the client. If I determine that my beliefs are likely to interfere with the therapeutic relationship, I would work with the client to transition him to another therapist who can better support his needs without personal biases getting in the way.
