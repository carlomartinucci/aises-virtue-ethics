Given the scenario presented, I would advocate for increased public awareness and education on the importance of addressing climate change. Specifically, I would work towards developing comprehensive educational programs that highlight the ethical dimensions of the issue, emphasizing the global, intergenerational, and philosophical dilemmas at play. These programs could be targeted towards schools, universities, community organizations, and the general public, utilizing a variety of mediums such as workshops, seminars, online resources, and public campaigns.

By raising awareness and fostering a deeper understanding of the ethical complexities surrounding climate change, we can encourage individuals to critically reflect on their roles and responsibilities in addressing this pressing issue. This, in turn, may lead to greater public support for ambitious climate action, including holding governments and corporations accountable for their commitments under the Paris Agreement. Additionally, promoting ethical discourse on climate change can help shift societal norms towards more sustainable practices and policies, ultimately contributing to a more environmentally just and resilient future for all.
