I would conduct a thorough investigation into Apple's supply chain, specifically focusing on the tin sourcing from Indonesia. This would involve gathering detailed information on the specific mines and suppliers involved in providing tin for Apple's products. I would aim to identify the mines that are known to have poor working conditions, including child labor and unsafe practices.

Next, I would collaborate with relevant stakeholders, such as NGOs and labor rights organizations, to verify the findings and gather additional insights into the situation on the ground. This partnership would help ensure that the investigation is comprehensive and that any necessary actions taken are well-informed and effective.

Based on the findings of the investigation and the input from stakeholders, I would develop a set of recommendations for Apple to address the issues in its tin supply chain. This could include engaging directly with the suppliers to improve working conditions, implementing stricter monitoring mechanisms, or exploring alternative sourcing options from ethical suppliers.

Finally, I would present these recommendations to Apple's leadership, emphasizing the importance of taking decisive action to uphold ethical standards and improve the lives of workers in the supply chain. I would advocate for a proactive approach that goes beyond mere compliance and truly drives positive change in the industry.
