Given the scenario, I would take the specific action of refusing to participate in any illegal activities, such as the break-in at the office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist. I would raise my concerns about the legality and morality of the proposed actions during the meeting when the break-in was being discussed. I would emphasize the importance of upholding the law and ethical standards, even in the face of pressure from higher authorities. If necessary, I would seek advice from legal counsel or appropriate authorities to ensure that my actions are in line with legal and ethical guidelines.
