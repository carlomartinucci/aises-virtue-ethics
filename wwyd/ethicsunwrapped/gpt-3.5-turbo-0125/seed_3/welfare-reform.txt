Given the scenario, I would work to gather data and conduct in-depth research on the impact of The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) on low-income families since its implementation in 1996. This research would involve analyzing the changes in welfare caseloads, employment rates, poverty levels, and the overall well-being of individuals affected by the legislation. I would collaborate with experts in economics, sociology, and public policy to ensure a comprehensive and unbiased assessment of the outcomes of the welfare reform act. This research would aim to provide evidence-based insights that could inform future policy decisions related to poverty alleviation and social welfare programs.
