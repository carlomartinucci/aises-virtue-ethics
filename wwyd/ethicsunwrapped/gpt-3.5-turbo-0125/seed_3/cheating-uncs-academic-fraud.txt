As a member of the academic integrity committee at UNC, I would work closely with the university administration to investigate the specific cases of academic fraud involving student-athletes and the AFAM department. I would review the evidence provided in the NCAA report and collaborate with other committee members to conduct interviews with relevant individuals, such as Julius Nyangâ€™oro, Deborah Crowder, and academic counselors implicated in the allegations.

I would also support efforts to implement stricter academic oversight and accountability measures within the university to prevent future instances of academic fraud. This could involve establishing clearer guidelines for course enrollment, enhancing faculty supervision of independent study courses, and conducting regular audits of classroom activities and coursework to ensure academic rigor and integrity.

Furthermore, I would advocate for increased transparency and communication between academic departments, student support programs, and athletics departments to address concerns about the balance between academics and athletics at major universities. By promoting a culture of academic excellence and integrity, we can uphold the university's reputation and commitment to providing students, including student-athletes, with a meaningful and legitimate education.
