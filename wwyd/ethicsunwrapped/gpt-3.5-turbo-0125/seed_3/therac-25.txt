I would immediately report the critical design flaws and software errors in the Therac-25 machine to the relevant regulatory authorities, such as the FDA. I would provide detailed documentation and evidence of the inadequacies in the machine's software and safety features to ensure that a thorough investigation is conducted. Additionally, I would advocate for the implementation of stricter regulations and oversight in the development and testing of medical devices to prevent similar incidents in the future.
