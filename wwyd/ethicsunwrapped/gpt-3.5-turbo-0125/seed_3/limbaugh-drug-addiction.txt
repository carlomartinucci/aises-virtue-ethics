I would first verify the accuracy of the information provided in the scenario by checking reliable sources to ensure that the details are correct. Next, I would consider the implications of Rush Limbaugh's actions on his public image, credibility, and the impact on his audience. I would also take into account the potential consequences of his illegal actions on the ongoing debates regarding drug abuse and addiction in the United States.

Given the seriousness of the situation and the inconsistency between Limbaugh's public statements on drug use and his own behavior, I would suggest that Limbaugh publicly address the issue and take responsibility for his actions. He should openly acknowledge his wrongdoing, apologize for his behavior, and use his platform to raise awareness about the dangers of substance abuse and the importance of seeking help for addiction.

Furthermore, I would recommend that Limbaugh engage in meaningful actions to make amends for his behavior, such as supporting organizations that help individuals struggling with addiction, advocating for better access to treatment programs, and using his influence to promote a more compassionate and understanding approach to addressing drug abuse in society. It is crucial for Limbaugh to demonstrate genuine remorse and a commitment to personal growth and positive change in order to rebuild trust with his audience and the public.
