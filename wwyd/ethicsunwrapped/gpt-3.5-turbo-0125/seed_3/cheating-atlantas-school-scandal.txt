I would have refused to change students' answers on the standardized tests, even if pressured by the principal or other teachers. Instead, I would have sought alternative strategies to support my students in improving their performance, such as providing extra tutoring, offering study resources, and implementing targeted interventions based on individual student needs. I would have also reported any suspicions of cheating to the appropriate authorities to ensure academic integrity and fairness in the assessment process.
