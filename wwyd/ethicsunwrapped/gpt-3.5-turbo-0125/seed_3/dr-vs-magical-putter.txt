I would acknowledge the mistakes made in the reporting of the article and the harm caused to Dr. Essay Anne Vanderbilt. I would apologize publicly for the lack of sensitivity and awareness regarding trans issues and for outing Vanderbilt as a transgender woman without her consent. I would take responsibility for the editorial decisions that led to the harmful portrayal of Vanderbilt and the role it played in her tragic death. I would commit to educating myself and my team about the transgender community and ensuring that future reporting is done with greater understanding and compassion.
