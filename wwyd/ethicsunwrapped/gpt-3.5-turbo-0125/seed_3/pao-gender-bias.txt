In this scenario, I would review all the evidence presented in court during the trial of Ellen Pao's lawsuit against Kleiner Perkins, paying close attention to the performance reviews, evaluations, meeting summaries, and messages that were used as evidence by both Pao's legal team and the defense. I would analyze the consistency and relevance of the performance reviews and feedback provided to Pao over the years to understand the basis for the claims made by both sides.

Additionally, I would conduct interviews with current and former employees of Kleiner Perkins to gather more insights into the work environment, culture, and treatment of women within the company. By speaking with individuals who have direct experience working at the firm, I would aim to gain a better understanding of the dynamics at play and any patterns of behavior that may support or refute the claims made by Pao and Kleiner Perkins.

Furthermore, I would seek to understand the policies and procedures in place at Kleiner Perkins related to gender discrimination, harassment, and promotion practices. By reviewing the firm's HR documentation, training materials, and internal communications, I would assess whether the company had adequate measures in position to prevent discrimination and support employees who raise concerns about their treatment in the workplace.

Overall, I would conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations raised by Ellen Pao and the defense presented by Kleiner Perkins to assess the validity of the claims and determine if there were any systemic issues within the company that needed to be addressed.
