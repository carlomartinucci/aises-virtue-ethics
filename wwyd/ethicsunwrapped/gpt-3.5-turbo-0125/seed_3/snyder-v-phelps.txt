I would advise Albert Snyder to seek support from mental health professionals, such as therapists or counselors, to help him cope with the emotional distress he is experiencing as a result of the actions of the Westboro Baptist Church. These professionals can provide him with tools and strategies to manage his depression and other health complications effectively. Additionally, I would recommend Albert Snyder to engage with support groups or communities of individuals who have gone through similar traumatic experiences to find comfort and solidarity.
