Based on the scenario provided, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Meet with the assistant principal who observed the classroom during Barron's lesson to discuss her concerns and perspectives on the situation.
2. Review the district's policies and guidelines on teaching sensitive topics such as racism and discrimination to ensure alignment with best practices and educational standards.
3. Organize a meeting with Barron to discuss the incident, gather his insights on the lesson, and provide guidance on effective and appropriate ways to teach about sensitive historical topics in the future.
4. Facilitate a dialogue or training session for staff members on culturally responsive teaching practices and strategies for addressing potentially controversial topics in the classroom.
5. Communicate with parents, students, and the community to address any concerns or questions regarding the incident and clarify the district's approach to handling sensitive subjects in the curriculum.
