I would report Andrew Wakefield's unethical behavior to the appropriate authorities, such as the General Medical Council or relevant medical regulatory bodies. I would provide them with detailed information about Wakefield's conflicts of interest, manipulation of research data, failure to disclose funding sources, and unethical treatment of research subjects. Additionally, I would cooperate fully with any investigations and provide any necessary evidence or testimony to help ensure that Wakefield is held accountable for his actions.
