If I were in this situation, I would acknowledge the discrepancies in the book and the public response to them. I would reach out to the readers who may have felt misled by the portrayal of the book as a memoir and offer a sincere apology on behalf of the publisher. Additionally, I would work with James Frey to discuss potential steps to rectify the situation, such as issuing a statement clarifying the nature of the book and any fictional elements it may contain. It would be important to prioritize transparency and honesty with the readers and the public to rebuild trust.
