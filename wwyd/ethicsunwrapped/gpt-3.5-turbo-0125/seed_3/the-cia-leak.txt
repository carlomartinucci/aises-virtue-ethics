I would respect Valerie Plame's concerns regarding the potential risks to national security posed by President Trump's pardon of Scooter Libby. I would acknowledge the importance of maintaining trust and collaboration between the president and the CIA for the sake of national security. In response, I would suggest that Plame and other concerned parties consider engaging in constructive dialogue with government officials to address their worries and work towards ensuring the safety of covert operatives and the integrity of CIA operations. Additionally, I would recommend exploring avenues for advocating for greater transparency and accountability in the use of presidential pardon powers to prevent potential threats to national security in the future.
