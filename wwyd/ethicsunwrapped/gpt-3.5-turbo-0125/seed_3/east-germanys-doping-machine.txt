I would prioritize the well-being and health of the affected athletes by providing them with comprehensive medical care and support services to address the physical and psychological consequences of the doping program. This would involve setting up clinics staffed with healthcare professionals specializing in treating the specific health issues resulting from the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Additionally, I would ensure that mental health resources are available to help athletes cope with the emotional trauma of being subjected to forced doping. It is crucial to establish a safe and confidential environment where athletes can openly discuss their experiences and receive appropriate care without fear of repercussions.
