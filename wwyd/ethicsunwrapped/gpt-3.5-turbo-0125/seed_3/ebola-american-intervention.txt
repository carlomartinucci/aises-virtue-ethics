Given the scenario, I would conduct a thorough evaluation and analysis of the situation to determine the most effective and appropriate course of action moving forward. This evaluation would include assessing the capabilities and limitations of the American military in providing humanitarian assistance, as well as considering the potential risks and ethical implications of military intervention in a public health crisis. Additionally, I would closely monitor the progress and outcomes of the relief efforts to ensure that resources are being utilized effectively and that the primary goal of containing the Ebola epidemic is being achieved.
