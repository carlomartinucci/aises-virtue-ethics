I would initiate a thorough investigation into the research practices at Heidelberg University and Wayne State University to determine if proper ethical guidelines were followed. This investigation would involve reviewing consent procedures for the use of human cadavers in the research, examining the specific methodologies used in the crash tests, and assessing the validity of the data obtained compared to data from crash test dummies. Additionally, I would engage with experts in bioethics to evaluate the ethical implications of using human cadavers in these studies and seek their recommendations on how to proceed in a way that upholds ethical standards while still advancing scientific knowledge in car safety.
