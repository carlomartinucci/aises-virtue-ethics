I would immediately report the information about the sexual assaults and cover-ups involving Baylor football players to the appropriate university officials, such as the Title IX coordinator, in order to ensure that the victims receive the support and protection they need. I would also provide any evidence that I have, such as the exchanged messages between Briles and McCaw, to the university officials to assist in their investigation and response to the situation.
