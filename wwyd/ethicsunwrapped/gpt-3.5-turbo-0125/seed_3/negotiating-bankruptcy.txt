If I were in this scenario, I would ensure full disclosure of all potential conflicts of interest to the bankruptcy judge when filing documents under oath for the appointment of counsel. Specifically, I would disclose that Milbank Tweed was representing both South Street and Mikael Salovaara in various matters related to the bankruptcy proceedings involving Bucyrus-Erie. This transparency would allow the bankruptcy judge to make an informed decision regarding the appointment of counsel and avoid any allegations of false statements under oath.
