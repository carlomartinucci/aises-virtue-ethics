I would conduct a thorough and detailed review of the financial records and documents related to the unauthorized bonuses and other financial transactions that led to Dennis Kozlowski's conviction. This review would aim to verify the accuracy and legality of the transactions in question, including examining the authorization processes, board approvals, and any relevant corporate policies or guidelines in place at the time. Additionally, I would consult with legal experts to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the legal implications and regulatory considerations surrounding these transactions.
