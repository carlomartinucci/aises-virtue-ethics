In this scenario, I would prioritize respecting the family's wishes for privacy during their time of grieving. I would refrain from reporting on the graphic details of Robin Williams's suicide in order to honor the family's request and to prevent potentially harmful effects on vulnerable individuals who may be influenced by such information. I would focus on reporting the story in a sensitive and responsible manner, emphasizing the impact of Williams's struggles with mental health and his openness about his own challenges to raise awareness and reduce stigma surrounding mental illness.
