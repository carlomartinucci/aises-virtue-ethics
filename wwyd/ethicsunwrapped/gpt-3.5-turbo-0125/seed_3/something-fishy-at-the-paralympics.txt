In this scenario, I would work with the relevant authorities, such as the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and national Paralympic committees, to strengthen the classification system and ensure its integrity. This could involve implementing stricter protocols for athlete classification, conducting more thorough evaluations, and increasing oversight and monitoring of the classification process. I would also support educational initiatives, like the online course launched by Australia, to ensure that all athletes, coaches, and staff understand the importance of ethical behavior and compliance with classification rules. Additionally, I would advocate for harsh penalties for those found to be cheating the system, in order to deter future misconduct and uphold the integrity of Paralympic competition.
