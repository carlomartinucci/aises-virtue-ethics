If I were aware of Rick Singer's fraudulent schemes and the parents involved in the college admissions scandal, I would immediately report this information to the appropriate authorities, such as the FBI or relevant law enforcement agencies. I would provide all the details I have on how Singer operated his illegal activities, the names of the parents involved, and any evidence I possess that could assist in the investigation and prosecution of those responsible. Additionally, I would cooperate fully with investigators and offer any further assistance needed to ensure that justice is served and the integrity of the college admissions process is upheld.
