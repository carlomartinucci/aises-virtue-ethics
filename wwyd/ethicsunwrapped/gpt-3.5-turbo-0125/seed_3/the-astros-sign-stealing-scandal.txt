I would report the sign-stealing scheme conducted by the Houston Astros to the relevant authorities, such as the Major League Baseball (MLB) Commissioner's Office or the league's investigative department. This action would be crucial in upholding the integrity of the sport and ensuring that appropriate measures are taken to address the cheating scandal. By reporting the misconduct, I would contribute to maintaining fairness and transparency in professional baseball, which is essential for the credibility and reputation of the sport.
