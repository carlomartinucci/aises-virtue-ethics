I would ensure that all co-authors of the retracted article are fully informed of the legal proceedings and the court's ruling to clarify any potential misunderstandings or concerns they may have regarding their roles in the case. This would involve organizing a meeting or communication to discuss the implications of the court's decision on their professional standing and to address any lingering questions or issues arising from the lawsuit. Additionally, I would provide support and guidance to the co-authors on how to navigate any potential fallout from the case within the scientific community, including strategies for rebuilding their reputations and credibility in light of the controversy surrounding the retracted article.
