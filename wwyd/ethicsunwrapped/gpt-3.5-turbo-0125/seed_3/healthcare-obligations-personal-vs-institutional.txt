I would recommend that Dr. Jones carefully review the available research on flu vaccine effectiveness and risks, including the reports mentioned in the scenario, to ensure that she is well-informed about the current evidence. 

After reviewing the research, I would suggest that Dr. Jones consider discussing her concerns with a trusted colleague or mentor within the medical community to gain additional perspective on the situation.

If Dr. Jones decides to inform her senior patients about her reservations regarding the efficacy of flu shots for their age group, I would advise her to do so in a respectful and non-confrontational manner, presenting the information as objectively as possible and emphasizing the importance of informed decision-making in healthcare. 

Additionally, I would recommend that Dr. Jones document her conversations with patients regarding flu shots in order to maintain thorough and accurate records of her interactions with patients. 

Lastly, I would suggest that Dr. Jones review the policies and guidelines of the AMA and her hospital regarding vaccination recommendations and patient communication to ensure that she is in compliance with any relevant rules and regulations.
