I would immediately report the unethical and illegal business practices of Enron to the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). I would provide detailed information about the fraudulent schemes employed by Enron, including the submission of false demand schedules, filing of imaginary transmission schedules, and engaging in deceptive practices to manipulate electricity prices.

Furthermore, I would cooperate fully with any investigations launched by these regulatory bodies, providing any evidence or documentation that would help uncover the extent of Enron's misconduct. It is crucial to ensure that those responsible for the fraudulent activities are held accountable and that measures are put in place to prevent such unethical behavior from occurring in the future.

Additionally, I would advise affected parties, such as the California electricity consumers impacted by Enron's actions, to seek legal recourse and potentially pursue claims for damages resulting from the manipulation of energy markets. It is essential to support efforts to rectify the harm caused by Enron's unethical practices and to uphold the integrity of the energy market for the benefit of all stakeholders.
