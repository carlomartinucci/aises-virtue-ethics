I would have immediately reported the incident to the authorities when graduate assistant coach Mike McQueary informed me that he witnessed Jerry Sandusky engaging in sexual activity with a young boy in the football locker room shower facilities. I would not have kept the information quiet and would have taken swift action to ensure that the victim received the necessary support and protection. Additionally, I would have cooperated fully with law enforcement in their investigation to ensure that justice was served and to prevent any further harm to potential victims.
