I would ensure that there are proper risk management procedures in place within the organization, including regular monitoring and oversight of trading activities. This would involve setting up clear reporting mechanisms for any losses or discrepancies, as well as implementing checks and balances to prevent individuals from single-handedly taking on excessive risks without oversight. Additionally, I would establish a culture that encourages transparency and open communication, so that employees feel comfortable reporting issues and seeking help when needed. Regular audits and reviews of trading activities would also be conducted to detect any irregularities or potential risks early on.
