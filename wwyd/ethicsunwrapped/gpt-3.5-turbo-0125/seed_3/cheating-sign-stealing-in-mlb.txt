If I were in this scenario, I would immediately report the Astros' sign-stealing scheme to the appropriate authorities within MLB, providing all the evidence and information I have regarding the "Codebreaker" system and the use of electronic means to decipher and signal signs. I would also be willing to testify if necessary to help ensure that the rules of fair play and integrity in the game of baseball are upheld.
