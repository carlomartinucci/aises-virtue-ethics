I would acknowledge the concerns raised by B.D. Wong and the Asian American community regarding the casting of a white actor in the role of the Eurasian 'Engineer' in Miss Saigon. I would take proactive steps to address the issue by engaging in open dialogue with the community, including representatives from Asian American organizations and advocacy groups. I would listen to their perspectives and seek to understand the impact of the casting decision on their community.

Additionally, I would work closely with the casting director and production team to explore alternative casting options that prioritize racial authenticity and representation. This could involve actively seeking out talented Asian actors who fit the criteria for the role and providing them with equal opportunities to audition for the part.

Furthermore, I would consider implementing sensitivity training for the cast and crew to ensure that cultural stereotypes are avoided and that the production respects the diverse backgrounds and identities of its characters. This training could help foster a more inclusive and respectful working environment for everyone involved in the production.

Overall, my approach would be to address the concerns raised by the community, actively seek out diverse casting options, and promote cultural sensitivity within the production to ensure that Miss Saigon is presented in a way that respects and honors the experiences of the Asian community.
