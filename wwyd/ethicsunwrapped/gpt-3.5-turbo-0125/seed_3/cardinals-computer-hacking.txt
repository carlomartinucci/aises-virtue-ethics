I would advise Chris Correa to fully cooperate with the ongoing investigation by the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice. He should provide all relevant information and assist in uncovering the extent of the unauthorized access and data theft from the Astros. Additionally, I would recommend that he take responsibility for his actions, show remorse, and work towards making amends with the Astros organization. Furthermore, I would suggest that he seek legal counsel to navigate the legal proceedings and ensure that his rights are protected throughout the process.
