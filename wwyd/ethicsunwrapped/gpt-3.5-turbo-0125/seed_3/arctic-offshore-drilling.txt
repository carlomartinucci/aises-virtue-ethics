I would conduct a thorough environmental impact assessment to evaluate the potential risks associated with offshore drilling in the Arctic. This assessment would involve studying the potential effects on the local ecosystem, endangered species, and the overall impact on climate change. Based on the findings of this assessment, I would present the results to decision-makers and stakeholders to inform them of the potential consequences of expanding drilling operations in the region. Additionally, I would collaborate with environmental organizations and experts to develop alternative energy solutions that could reduce the reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate the environmental risks posed by offshore drilling.
