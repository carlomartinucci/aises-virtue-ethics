I would conduct a thorough investigation into the incident at the Philadelphia Starbucks location, including interviewing all parties involved - the two men, the employee who made the initial request, the manager who called the police, the police officers who responded, and any witnesses. I would review security footage, if available, to gain a clear understanding of what transpired.

Based on the findings of the investigation, I would take appropriate disciplinary action against any employees found to have acted inappropriately or in a discriminatory manner. This may include additional training, reassignment, or termination, depending on the severity of the misconduct.

I would also review and revise store policies and procedures to ensure that incidents of this nature are handled appropriately in the future. This may involve updating training protocols for employees, clarifying guidelines for when to involve law enforcement, and implementing measures to prevent implicit bias from influencing decision-making.

Additionally, I would personally reach out to Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson to offer a sincere apology on behalf of Starbucks and to discuss ways in which the company can make amends for the wrongful arrest and mistreatment they experienced. This may include providing compensation, offering support for their business endeavors, or engaging in community initiatives to address racial bias and discrimination.

Overall, my focus would be on taking concrete actions to address the specific circumstances of the incident, prevent similar occurrences in the future, and demonstrate Starbucks' commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
