Given the scenario, I would first ensure the safety and well-being of activist Brittany Newsome who was arrested for removing the Confederate flag from the South Carolina State House. I would work to make sure she has legal representation, access to any necessary resources, and monitor the situation to ensure she is treated fairly under the law. Additionally, I would support her right to peaceful protest and express her views.

Furthermore, I would engage in dialogue with individuals on both sides of the debate regarding the Confederate flag to understand their perspectives and concerns. I would facilitate respectful discussions and encourage empathy and understanding among those with differing viewpoints. This could involve organizing community forums, educational sessions, or mediation efforts to promote constructive conversations and potentially find common ground.

Lastly, I would work with relevant stakeholders, such as legislators, community leaders, historians, and advocacy groups, to explore alternative ways to address the legacy of the Confederate flag in a manner that fosters unity and reconciliation. This could include proposing initiatives for historical education, memorialization, or cultural awareness that honor diverse experiences and promote healing in the community.
