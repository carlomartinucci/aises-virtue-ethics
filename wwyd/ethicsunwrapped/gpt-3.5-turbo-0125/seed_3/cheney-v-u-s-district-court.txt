I would review the Code of Conduct for United States Judges to determine the specific rules and guidelines regarding judicial ethics and recusal in situations where a judge's impartiality might be questioned. After examining the applicable rules, I would assess whether Justice Scalia's actions, specifically his socializing with Vice President Cheney during the pending case, potentially violated any specific provisions of the code. If there is a clear violation, I would consider the appropriate course of action, such as raising the issue within the legal community or relevant authorities for further investigation and potential disciplinary action.
