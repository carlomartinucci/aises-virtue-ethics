I would conduct a thorough investigation into Apple's supply chain to verify the claims made in their annual reports regarding improvements in suppliers' working conditions. This investigation would involve reviewing documentation, conducting on-site visits to supplier facilities, and interviewing workers to assess the actual conditions they are working in. If any discrepancies or violations are found, I would report them to Apple's management and urge them to take immediate corrective action to ensure the safety and well-being of the workers in their supply chain. Additionally, I would recommend implementing a more robust monitoring and auditing system to prevent future ethical lapses in their supply chain.
