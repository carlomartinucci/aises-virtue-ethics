I would take the following specific actions in response to the Wells Fargo scandal:

1. Implement a thorough review of the bank's sales practices and policies to identify and address any unethical or fraudulent behavior.
2. Provide support and resources for employees who have experienced stress, panic attacks, or other symptoms as a result of the toxic corporate culture.
3. Apologize publicly for the unethical behavior and wrongdoing that occurred within the bank.
4. Offer restitution and refunds to affected customers who were charged for unauthorized accounts or services.
5. Cooperate fully with regulatory investigations and enforcement actions to ensure accountability for the fraudulent activities.
6. Conduct a comprehensive audit of all accounts and transactions to identify and rectify any unauthorized or fraudulent activities.
7. Hold accountable any executives or managers who were complicit in or aware of the fraudulent practices.
8. Establish new internal controls and oversight mechanisms to prevent similar unethical behavior in the future.
9. Engage with stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, and employees, to rebuild trust and confidence in the bank's operations.
10. Work with independent ethics and compliance experts to develop and implement a robust ethics and compliance program to prevent future misconduct.
