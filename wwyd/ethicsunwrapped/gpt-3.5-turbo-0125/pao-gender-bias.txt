Given the scenario, I would review the evidence presented during the trial, including performance reviews, evaluations, meeting summaries, and messages, to understand the basis for the jury's decision. I would also analyze the specific claims made by Ellen Pao against Kleiner Perkins to identify any discrepancies or inconsistencies in the arguments presented by both parties. Additionally, I would study the testimonies of the jurors to gain insights into their thought processes and considerations during the deliberation process. This analysis would help in understanding the factors that influenced the jury's decision and the implications of the verdict on future cases of workplace discrimination.
