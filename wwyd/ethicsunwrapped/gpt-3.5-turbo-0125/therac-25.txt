I would immediately report the situation to the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the FDA, providing detailed information about the incidents, the inadequate repairs, and the potential risks posed by the Therac-25 machines. I would also recommend a thorough investigation into the software design, testing procedures, and safety features of the machines to prevent further harm to patients. Additionally, I would suggest implementing stricter reporting requirements for radiation equipment to ensure transparency and accountability in the future.
