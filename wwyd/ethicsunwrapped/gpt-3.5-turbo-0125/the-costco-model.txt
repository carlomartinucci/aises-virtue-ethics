If I were in a position to implement changes in a company to improve employee treatment and success, I would focus on the following actions:

1. Conduct a comprehensive review of the company's current wage structure and benefits package to ensure they are competitive and fair compared to industry standards.
2. Implement training programs to enhance employee skills and provide opportunities for career advancement within the company.
3. Encourage a culture of autonomy and problem-solving among employees to foster a sense of ownership and engagement in their work.
4. Explore ways to reduce turnover costs by investing in employee retention strategies, such as offering comprehensive health and retirement benefits.
5. Regularly communicate with employees to gather feedback on their experiences and areas for improvement, ensuring their voices are heard and valued in decision-making processes.
