If I were in this situation, I would ensure full transparency and disclosure of all potential conflicts of interest to the bankruptcy judge when filing the Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on behalf of BE. Specifically, I would disclose the fact that Milbank Tweed was representing both South Street and Salovaara in various matters related to the bankruptcy proceedings. This disclosure would be crucial in maintaining the integrity of the legal process and avoiding any potential conflicts of interest that could compromise the fairness of the proceedings.
