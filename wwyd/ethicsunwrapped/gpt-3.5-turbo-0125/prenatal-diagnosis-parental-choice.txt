I would conduct research to gather data and information on the impact of prenatal testing bans on abortion, specifically focusing on the experiences of individuals and families affected by Down syndrome. This research would involve studying medical outcomes, societal implications, and ethical considerations related to such bans. Additionally, I would seek out expert opinions from medical professionals, ethicists, and advocacy groups to gain a comprehensive understanding of the issue from various perspectives. This research would help inform decision-making and potential advocacy efforts on the topic of prenatal testing bans on abortion.
