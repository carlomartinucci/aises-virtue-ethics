I would conduct a thorough investigation into the incident at the Starbucks location in Philadelphia to understand the sequence of events and identify any lapses in policy or training that may have contributed to the wrongful arrest of Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson. This investigation would involve interviewing the employees involved, reviewing security footage, and speaking with witnesses to gather all relevant information.

Based on the findings of the investigation, I would take immediate corrective action, which may include retraining employees on company policies regarding customer interactions, diversity, and inclusion. I would also ensure that appropriate disciplinary measures are taken against any employees found to have acted inappropriately or discriminated against the two men.

Furthermore, I would reach out to Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson to offer a sincere apology on behalf of Starbucks and to discuss ways in which we can make amends for the unjust treatment they experienced. This may involve offering compensation, providing support for any legal fees incurred, and engaging in a dialogue to address their concerns and ensure that such incidents do not happen again in the future.

Lastly, I would work closely with community leaders, civil rights organizations, and experts in diversity and inclusion to develop a comprehensive plan for addressing implicit bias and discrimination within Starbucks. This plan may include ongoing training for employees, community outreach initiatives, and regular assessments of the company's progress in creating a safe and welcoming environment for all customers.
