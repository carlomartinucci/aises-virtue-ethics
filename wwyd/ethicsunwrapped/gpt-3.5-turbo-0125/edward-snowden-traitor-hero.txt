If I were in a position to make a decision regarding Edward Snowden's actions, I would consider the following concrete actions:

1. Evaluate the specific content of the leaked documents to determine the extent of the information disclosed and the potential impact on national security.
2. Assess the legality of Snowden's actions based on existing laws and regulations, including the Espionage Act of 1917.
3. Consider the ethical implications of Snowden's actions in terms of the public interest and the right to privacy.
4. Review any internal mechanisms or channels that were available to Snowden for reporting concerns about government surveillance programs.
5. Consult with legal experts, government officials, and other stakeholders to gather diverse perspectives on the situation.
6. Determine the appropriate course of action, which may involve legal proceedings, diplomatic negotiations, or other forms of resolution based on the findings of the evaluation process.
