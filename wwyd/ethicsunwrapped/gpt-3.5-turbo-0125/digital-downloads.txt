I would analyze the current situation and gather information on the impact of digital music platforms on artist compensation. This would involve researching the revenue models of platforms like iTunes, Pandora, and Apple Music, as well as understanding the perspectives of artists and industry stakeholders on the issue. I would also review the changes made by Apple in response to Taylor Swift's open letter to assess the effectiveness of such actions in addressing artist compensation concerns. Based on this analysis, I would develop recommendations for how digital music platforms can better support artists while balancing the need for innovation and access to music for consumers.
