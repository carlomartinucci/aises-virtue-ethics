If I were in a position to prevent the collapse of Barings Bank due to Nick Leeson's actions, I would immediately escalate my concerns about Leeson's trading activities to senior management in London. I would provide detailed evidence of the hidden losses, the speculative trading, and the escalating risks that Leeson was taking. I would emphasize the urgent need for intervention to mitigate the potential catastrophic losses that could threaten the bank's stability.

Additionally, I would recommend implementing enhanced oversight and risk management procedures for all trading activities, especially those conducted by high-risk traders like Leeson. I would propose regular and thorough audits of trading accounts, increased transparency in reporting, and the establishment of clear protocols for addressing losses and escalating risks.

Furthermore, I would advocate for a comprehensive review of the bank's internal controls and governance structure to identify weaknesses that allowed Leeson's actions to go undetected for so long. It would be crucial to learn from this incident and implement robust measures to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future.

Overall, my immediate actions would focus on alerting senior management, implementing enhanced oversight and risk management procedures, and conducting a thorough review of internal controls to prevent the collapse of Barings Bank.
