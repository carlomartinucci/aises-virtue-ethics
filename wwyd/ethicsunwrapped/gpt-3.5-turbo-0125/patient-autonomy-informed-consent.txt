In this case, I would convene a meeting with the hospital staff involved in the patient's care, including the medical team, the patient's son who is the guardian, and any relevant mental health professionals. During this meeting, I would facilitate a discussion to explore alternative options for administering the new drug to the patient.

Specifically, I would suggest considering the possibility of engaging in open and honest communication with the patient about the new medication. This could involve explaining the benefits of the drug in a way that addresses the patient's fears and concerns about being poisoned. Additionally, I would propose involving a mental health counselor or therapist to work with the patient on managing his paranoia and building trust in the medical team.

Furthermore, I would recommend exploring other forms of the medication or alternative treatment options that may be more acceptable to the patient. It is crucial to prioritize the patient's autonomy and involve him in the decision-making process to the extent possible, even if he has been deemed mentally incompetent.

Ultimately, the goal would be to find a solution that respects the patient's autonomy while also considering his best interests and the recommendations of the medical team.
