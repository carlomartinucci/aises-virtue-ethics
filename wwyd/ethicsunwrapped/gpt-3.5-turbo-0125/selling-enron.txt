If I were in this scenario, I would immediately report the unethical and illegal business practices of Enron to the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). I would provide detailed information about the schemes Enron used to manipulate electricity markets in California, including submitting false demand schedules, creating imaginary transmission schedules, and selling services they did not have.

I would also cooperate fully with any investigations that are launched as a result of the report, providing any additional information or evidence that could help uncover the extent of Enron's fraudulent activities. Additionally, I would encourage other employees who are aware of these practices to come forward and report them as well.

Furthermore, I would work towards ensuring that Enron's customers are compensated for any financial losses they incurred as a result of the company's actions. This could involve advocating for restitution or participating in efforts to hold Enron accountable for the harm it caused to consumers and the broader energy market.

Overall, my primary focus would be on exposing the truth about Enron's misconduct, cooperating with authorities to hold the company accountable, and seeking justice for those affected by its fraudulent practices.
