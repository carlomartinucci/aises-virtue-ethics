I would acknowledge the concerns raised by Asian American actor B.D. Wong and the Actors' Equity Association regarding the casting of Jonathan Pryce as the Eurasian character in Miss Saigon. To address the issue of representation and diversity in the performing arts, I would work with the production team to actively seek out and audition talented Asian actors for the role of 'the Engineer.' This would involve reaching out to Asian American theater communities, casting agencies, and talent networks to ensure that the casting process is inclusive and provides opportunities for underrepresented actors. Additionally, I would collaborate with the director and casting director to conduct a thorough search for a suitable Asian actor who meets the criteria outlined by Vincent G. Liff, such as having a classical stage background and international reputation. By actively seeking out Asian talent for the role, we can promote diversity and authenticity in the production while also addressing the concerns raised by the community.
