I would first review the specific curriculum guidelines and policies set by the school district regarding the teaching of sensitive topics such as racism and discrimination. I would also examine any specific guidelines related to the use of visual aids or multimedia materials in the classroom.

Next, I would schedule a meeting with Alan Barron to discuss the incident and gather his perspective on the lesson in question. I would ask him to provide a detailed explanation of his intentions behind showing the video and how he framed the discussion around it.

I would then meet with the assistant principal who raised concerns about the lesson to understand her perspective and reasoning behind stopping the video. I would aim to facilitate a constructive dialogue between Barron and the assistant principal to address any misunderstandings and clarify the educational objectives of the lesson.

Additionally, I would organize a meeting with the parents, including Adrienne Aaron, to listen to their feedback and concerns regarding the lesson. I would emphasize the importance of open communication and collaboration between the school, teachers, and parents in addressing sensitive topics in the curriculum.

Finally, I would work with the school administration to provide professional development opportunities for teachers on how to effectively teach about sensitive historical topics, promote cultural sensitivity, and navigate potentially controversial content in the classroom. This would help ensure that similar incidents are handled thoughtfully and proactively in the future.
