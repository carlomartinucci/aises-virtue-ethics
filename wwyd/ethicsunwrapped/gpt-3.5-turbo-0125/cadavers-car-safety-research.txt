I would conduct a thorough review of the research protocols and procedures followed by Heidelberg University and Wayne State University in conducting the car crash tests using human cadavers. This review would include examining how the cadavers were obtained, whether proper consent was obtained from the families, and how the research results were being used to improve car safety. Additionally, I would assess the extent to which the use of human cadavers provided unique insights that could not be obtained from crash test dummies. Based on this review, I would make recommendations on whether the use of human cadavers in such research should be continued or if alternative methods should be explored.
