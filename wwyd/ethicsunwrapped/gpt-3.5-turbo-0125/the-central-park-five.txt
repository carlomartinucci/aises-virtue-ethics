I would work towards advocating for criminal justice reform by raising awareness about the Central Park 5 case and the issue of wrongful convictions. I would collaborate with organizations that focus on exoneration cases and work to implement policies that prevent coerced confessions and ensure fair trials for all individuals. Additionally, I would support initiatives that provide resources and support for those who have been wrongfully convicted, helping them reintegrate into society and seek justice for the injustices they have faced.
