I would conduct a thorough investigation into the treatment and welfare of the bulls used in bullfighting. This would involve visiting bullfighting arenas, speaking with bull breeders, attending bullfights, and consulting with veterinarians specializing in animal welfare. By gathering first-hand information and data, I would be able to assess the actual conditions in which the bulls are raised, transported, and ultimately fought in the ring. This investigation would provide me with a comprehensive understanding of the ethical implications of bullfighting and help me make informed decisions on how to address any potential issues related to animal welfare.
