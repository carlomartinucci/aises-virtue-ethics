If I were in this situation, I would immediately report the sign-stealing scheme known as "Codebreaker" to the appropriate authorities within the Houston Astros organization, such as the team owner Jim Crane or the MLB commissioner's office. I would provide all the information I have about the scheme, including how it was carried out, who was involved, and the impact it had on the game. I would emphasize the importance of upholding the integrity of the sport and the need to take swift and decisive action to address the cheating scandal.
