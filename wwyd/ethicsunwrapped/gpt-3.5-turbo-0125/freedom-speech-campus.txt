I would first ensure that the safety and well-being of all students involved in the protests are prioritized. This includes working with campus security and relevant authorities to address any potential threats or risks to the protesters.

I would also facilitate open dialogues and discussions between the student activists, university administrators, and faculty members to address the underlying issues of racial discrimination and create a more inclusive campus environment. This could involve organizing town hall meetings, diversity training sessions, and cultural sensitivity workshops to promote understanding and respect among all members of the university community.

Furthermore, I would support efforts to review and revise university policies and procedures related to diversity, equity, and inclusion to prevent future incidents of racial discrimination and promote a more welcoming campus climate for students of color. This may involve collaborating with student groups, faculty committees, and other stakeholders to implement meaningful changes that address systemic issues of racism on campus.
