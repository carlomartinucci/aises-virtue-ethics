I would recommend conducting further research and studies to better understand the long-term effects of playing football on brain health. This could involve funding independent research studies that focus on the impact of repetitive head impacts on players' brain health, as well as investigating potential risk factors that may predispose certain individuals to developing CTE. Additionally, I would suggest collaborating with medical professionals and neuroscientists to develop more accurate diagnostic tools for detecting brain injuries in living players, which could help in early intervention and prevention strategies.
