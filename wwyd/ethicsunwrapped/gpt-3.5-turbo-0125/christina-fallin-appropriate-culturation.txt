I would reach out to Christina Fallin and Pink Pony to offer to facilitate a meeting between them and members of the Native American community, particularly individuals from the Kiowa tribe like Summer Morgan. This meeting could provide an opportunity for Fallin and her band to listen to the perspectives and concerns of Native Americans regarding cultural appropriation and the significance of headdresses. It could also serve as a platform for constructive dialogue, education, and potential collaboration on ways to respectfully engage with and appreciate Native American cultures in their artistic expressions moving forward.
