I would first acknowledge and reflect on my own religious beliefs and how they may be influencing my ability to provide unbiased treatment to the client. I would then consult with a supervisor or a colleague who is experienced in handling ethical dilemmas in social work practice. Together, we would discuss the situation and explore potential solutions that align with the ethical principles of the social work profession.

One specific action I would take is to have an open and honest conversation with the client about my concerns regarding my ability to provide unbiased treatment due to my religious beliefs. I would explain that while I am committed to providing the best care possible, I recognize the importance of the client feeling fully supported and respected in therapy. I would offer to help the client find a new therapist who can better support him in his journey, ensuring a smooth transition and continuity of care.
