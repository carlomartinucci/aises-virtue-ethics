I would work towards raising awareness about the importance of the Paris climate agreement and the urgency of taking stronger actions to combat climate change. This could involve organizing educational events, workshops, and campaigns to inform the public about the potential consequences of not meeting the 2-degree Celsius target and the ethical dilemmas involved in addressing climate change. Additionally, I would advocate for increased governmental and corporate accountability in meeting their emission reduction targets and push for more ambitious and binding commitments to ensure a sustainable future for all generations.
