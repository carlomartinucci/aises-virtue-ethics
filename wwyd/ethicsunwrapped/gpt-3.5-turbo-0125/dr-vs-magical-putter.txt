Given the scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Conduct a thorough internal review of the editorial process that led to the decision to publish the article, including examining the communication between the journalist, Caleb Hannan, and the editorial team at Grantland.

2. Implement additional training and education for all staff members at Grantland on issues related to ethics in journalism, sensitivity towards marginalized communities, and responsible reporting practices.

3. Reach out to experts in the transgender community to seek guidance on how to better understand and represent transgender individuals in future reporting.

4. Issue a public apology to the transgender community, acknowledging the harm caused by the article and committing to improving Grantland's editorial standards to prevent similar incidents in the future.

5. Offer support and resources to the family and friends of Dr. Essay Anne Vanderbilt, as well as to the transgender community at large, to address the impact of the article and the subsequent events.

6. Engage in ongoing dialogue with stakeholders, including members of the transgender community, to learn from the mistakes made in this case and to ensure that Grantland upholds ethical standards in all future reporting.
