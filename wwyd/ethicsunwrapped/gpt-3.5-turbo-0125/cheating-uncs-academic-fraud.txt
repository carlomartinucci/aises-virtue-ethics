I would conduct a thorough review of the academic records of student-athletes at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC) who were enrolled in the Department of African and Afro-American Studies (AFAM) courses during the period of academic fraud. This review would involve examining the coursework completed by these student-athletes, verifying the legitimacy of the grades received, and identifying any irregularities or discrepancies that may indicate academic fraud.

Additionally, I would interview key individuals involved in the academic fraud scheme, including Julius Nyang’oro, Deborah Crowder, and the academic counselors in UNC’s Office of Academic Support Program for Student Athletes. These interviews would aim to gather more information about the extent of the fraud, the motivations behind it, and the roles played by each individual in perpetuating the scheme.

Furthermore, I would collaborate with the NCAA and other relevant authorities to ensure that appropriate disciplinary actions are taken against those responsible for the academic fraud at UNC. This may involve sanctions against the individuals involved, as well as implementing measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
