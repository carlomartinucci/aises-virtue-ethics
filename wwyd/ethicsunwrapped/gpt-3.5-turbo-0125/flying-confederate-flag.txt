I would acknowledge the complexity of the situation and the differing perspectives on the Confederate flag's symbolism. I would listen to the arguments presented by both sides, including those who view the flag as a symbol of historical pride and those who see it as a symbol of hate. I would seek to understand the historical context and the emotions involved in the debate.

Given the legal requirement for the flag's removal from the South Carolina State House grounds, I would ensure that the removal process is carried out safely and respectfully. I would coordinate with relevant authorities to ensure that the removal is done in a manner that minimizes any potential conflicts or disruptions.

I would also consider engaging in community dialogue and education initiatives to facilitate understanding and healing around the issues raised by the flag's removal. This could involve organizing public forums, educational events, or other activities aimed at promoting reconciliation and mutual respect among different groups in the community.
