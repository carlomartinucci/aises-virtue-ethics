In this scenario, I would first ensure that the well-being and safety of both the teacher and the student are the top priorities. I would schedule a private meeting with both the teacher, Idalia Hern√°ndez Ramos, and the student who posted the hurtful messages to discuss the incident and its impact on both parties. During this meeting, I would facilitate a constructive dialogue to help them understand each other's perspectives and feelings.

I would provide support and guidance to the student to help her understand the consequences of her actions and the importance of respectful communication, both online and offline. I would also offer resources and counseling services to address any underlying issues that may have contributed to her behavior.

For the teacher, I would offer support and resources to help her cope with the emotional impact of the cyber harassment. I would also discuss appropriate ways to address such incidents in the future, emphasizing the importance of maintaining professionalism and boundaries while dealing with student behavior.

Additionally, I would work with school administrators to review and strengthen policies and guidelines related to cyberbullying and social media use among students and staff. This may include providing training on digital citizenship and online etiquette to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Overall, my actions would focus on promoting understanding, empathy, and positive communication to address the cyber harassment incident while upholding the rights and dignity of all individuals involved.
