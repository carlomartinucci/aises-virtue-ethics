I would report the findings of the Pepper Hamilton investigation to the appropriate authorities, including law enforcement and the relevant regulatory bodies. This would involve providing all the evidence and documentation gathered during the investigation to ensure that the appropriate legal actions are taken against those responsible for the mishandling of sexual assault cases within the Baylor football program. Additionally, I would work with the university administration to implement necessary policy changes and training programs to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
