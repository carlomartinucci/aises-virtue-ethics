In this scenario, I would first seek to understand the perspectives of both sides - those who support high stakes testing and those who oppose it. I would gather information on the impact of standardized testing on students, teachers, and the educational system as a whole. 

Next, I would facilitate open discussions and forums where parents, teachers, administrators, and students can express their concerns and suggestions regarding high stakes testing. This would provide a platform for constructive dialogue and the opportunity to find common ground or potential solutions.

Additionally, I would conduct research on alternative assessment methods that could be more effective and less detrimental to students. This could involve exploring project-based assessments, portfolios, or other forms of evaluation that provide a more comprehensive view of student learning.

Lastly, I would work towards advocating for policy changes or reforms that address the concerns raised by opponents of high stakes testing while still ensuring accountability and educational standards are met. This could involve collaborating with policymakers, educators, and community members to find a balanced approach to assessment in education.
