I would acknowledge the horrific actions committed by Franz Stangl during the Holocaust, including his role in overseeing the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of innocent people at Treblinka. I would recognize the immense suffering and loss caused by his actions and the importance of holding individuals accountable for such atrocities. I would also emphasize the significance of learning from history to prevent such atrocities from happening again in the future.
