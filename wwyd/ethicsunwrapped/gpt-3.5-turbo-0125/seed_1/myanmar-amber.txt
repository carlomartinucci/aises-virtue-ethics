I would collaborate with other paleontologists, researchers, and stakeholders to develop and implement a comprehensive ethical sourcing framework for the acquisition of Myanmar's amber fossils. This framework would include guidelines for verifying the origins of fossils, ensuring fair labor practices, and minimizing the contribution to conflict financing. I would work towards establishing a certification process to validate that the fossils have been ethically sourced, thereby allowing scientists and collectors to make informed decisions that align with ethical considerations. Additionally, I would advocate for greater transparency in the supply chain and support initiatives that promote sustainable mining practices and community development in the region.
