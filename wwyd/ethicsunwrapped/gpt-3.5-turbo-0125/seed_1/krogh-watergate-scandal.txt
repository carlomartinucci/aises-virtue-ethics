If I were in Egil "Bud" Krogh's position during the meeting where the break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office was proposed and approved, I would have raised concerns about the legality and morality of the operation. I would have insisted on a thorough discussion about the justifications for such a drastic action, emphasizing the need to uphold the rule of law and ethical standards in all government actions. I would have voiced my reservations about the potential consequences of engaging in illegal activities and the impact it could have on the reputation and integrity of the administration. I would have advocated for alternative, lawful methods to address the leak of sensitive information, emphasizing the importance of maintaining ethical behavior and respect for the law in all circumstances.
