I would work to educate and raise awareness about the importance of the Paris climate agreement and the need for stronger action on climate change. This could involve organizing public events, creating educational materials, and engaging with local communities to highlight the ethical dimensions of the issue. I would also collaborate with other organizations and individuals who are advocating for more ambitious climate policies to build a stronger movement for change. Additionally, I would reach out to policymakers to express support for stronger climate action and urge them to prioritize the long-term well-being of both current and future generations when making decisions related to climate policy.
