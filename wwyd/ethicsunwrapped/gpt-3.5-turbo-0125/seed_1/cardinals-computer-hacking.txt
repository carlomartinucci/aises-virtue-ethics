I would not engage in hacking or any form of unauthorized access to another organization's systems or information. If I had concerns about the potential theft of intellectual property or data by former colleagues, I would report them to the appropriate authorities within my organization, such as the legal department or senior management, and provide any evidence or information that could support an investigation. It is important to address any suspicions or concerns through proper channels and in accordance with the law, rather than resorting to illegal activities like hacking.
