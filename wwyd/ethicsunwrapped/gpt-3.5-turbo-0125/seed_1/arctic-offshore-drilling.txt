I would conduct a thorough environmental impact assessment of the proposed offshore drilling project in the Arctic. This assessment would involve studying the potential effects on the local ecosystem, including endangered species such as polar bears, walruses, seals, and whales. Additionally, I would evaluate the risks of an oil spill in icy waters and the ability of oil companies to effectively clean up such a spill in such conditions. This assessment would provide a scientific basis for evaluating the potential environmental risks and benefits of the drilling project.
