In this scenario, I would prioritize the ethical principle of respecting the family's privacy and the potential harm caused by providing excessive detail about Robin Williams' suicide. Given the objections raised by both fans and mental health professionals, as well as the guidance from the Press Complaints Commission, I would refrain from including graphic details about the method used in my reporting.

Instead, I would focus on providing a respectful and sensitive portrayal of the situation, acknowledging the family's right to grieve in peace and the potential impact of sensationalized reporting on vulnerable individuals. I would aim to strike a balance between reporting the necessary facts for public understanding while avoiding unnecessary explicit details that could sensationalize the tragic event and potentially contribute to harmful outcomes.

Furthermore, I would consider the broader context of mental health awareness and stigma reduction, as highlighted by Zelda Williams in her interview. I would aim to contribute to a more compassionate and informative conversation about mental health issues, emphasizing the importance of seeking help and support in times of struggle.

Ultimately, my approach would be to report on the story truthfully and factually while being mindful of the ethical considerations surrounding privacy, sensitivity, and the potential implications of media coverage on mental health awareness and public discourse.
