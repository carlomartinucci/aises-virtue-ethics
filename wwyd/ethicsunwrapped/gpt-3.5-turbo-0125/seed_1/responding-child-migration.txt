I would work to assess the immediate needs of the unaccompanied minors who have arrived in the U.S. by coordinating with local social service agencies and non-profit organizations to provide them with temporary shelter, food, medical care, and legal support. I would prioritize the safety and well-being of these children by ensuring they are placed in appropriate housing facilities and connected with resources to address their physical and emotional needs. Additionally, I would collaborate with immigration lawyers to help the minors navigate the legal process and apply for asylum if they qualify for refugee status. It is crucial to ensure that these vulnerable children are treated with compassion and dignity while working within the existing legal framework to address their situation.
