I would work to raise awareness about the case, focusing on the indisputable evidence of innocence and the injustice faced by the Central Park 5. This could involve organizing public events, reaching out to media outlets for coverage, and collaborating with advocacy groups to push for criminal justice reforms that prevent similar miscarriages of justice in the future. I would also seek to engage with politicians and policymakers to advocate for accountability for those involved in the wrongful conviction of the Central Park 5, including the lead prosecutor, head detective, and others who continue to deny the evidence of their innocence.
