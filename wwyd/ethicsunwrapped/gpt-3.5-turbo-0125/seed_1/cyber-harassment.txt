I would first ensure that the well-being and safety of the student who posted the hurtful messages is addressed by providing her with support and guidance to understand the impact of her actions. This could involve counseling or mediation sessions to help her express her feelings in a constructive manner and learn appropriate ways to communicate online.

Next, I would organize a school-wide educational session on cyberbullying, online etiquette, and the consequences of harmful digital behavior. This session would aim to raise awareness among students about the potential harm caused by cyberbullying and encourage them to choose positive ways to interact online.

I would also work with school administrators to review and update policies related to cyberbullying and social media use to ensure that appropriate measures are in place to prevent and address such incidents in the future. This may involve revising codes of conduct, implementing stricter monitoring of online activities, and providing additional training for teachers and staff on how to respond to cyberbullying effectively.

Additionally, I would collaborate with parents and guardians to educate them about the importance of monitoring their children's online activities and guiding them on responsible internet use. This could include hosting workshops or sending out informational materials to help parents support their children in navigating the online world safely and respectfully.
