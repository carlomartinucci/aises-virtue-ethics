If I were in the position of any individual involved in the Astros' sign-stealing scandal, I would take responsibility for my actions and publicly apologize for my role in the scheme. I would acknowledge the harm done to the integrity of the game of baseball, express remorse for participating in cheating, and accept any consequences imposed by MLB. Additionally, I would work towards rebuilding trust with fans, players, and the baseball community by demonstrating a commitment to fair play and ethical conduct moving forward.
