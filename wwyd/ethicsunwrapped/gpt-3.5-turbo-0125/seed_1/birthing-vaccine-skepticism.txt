I would report Andrew Wakefield's unethical actions and misconduct to the appropriate authorities, such as the General Medical Council, to ensure that he faces the consequences of his fraudulent research and conflicts of interest. Additionally, I would support efforts to retract the fraudulent research article from The Lancet and work to correct the misinformation that has led to vaccine hesitancy and the resurgence of preventable diseases.
