I would engage in dialogue with the student protesters to understand their concerns and perspectives. I would listen actively to their experiences of feeling marginalized and invalidated on campus. I would express empathy and validate their feelings, acknowledging the importance of creating a safe and inclusive environment for all students. Additionally, I would communicate the value of free speech and the importance of engaging in respectful and open conversations to address issues of social equality on campus. I would emphasize the need for constructive dialogue that allows for diverse viewpoints to be heard while also fostering a sense of community and belonging for all students.
