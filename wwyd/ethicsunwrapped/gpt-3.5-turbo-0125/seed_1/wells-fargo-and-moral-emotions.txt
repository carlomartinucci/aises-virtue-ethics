I would conduct a thorough internal investigation to identify all individuals involved in the fraudulent account creation and unethical practices at Wells Fargo. This would involve reviewing internal documents, communication records, and interviewing employees at all levels of the organization to gather evidence. Additionally, I would work closely with regulators and law enforcement agencies to ensure full cooperation and transparency in the investigation process.

Based on the findings of the investigation, I would take swift and decisive action to hold individuals accountable for their actions. This could include terminating employees who were directly involved in creating fake accounts, as well as implementing disciplinary measures for those who were complicit or turned a blind eye to the fraudulent activities.

Furthermore, I would prioritize restoring trust with customers who were affected by the fraudulent practices. This would involve reaching out to impacted individuals, offering restitution for any financial harm incurred, and implementing new policies and procedures to prevent similar unethical behavior in the future.

Lastly, I would work with senior leadership to overhaul the corporate culture at Wells Fargo, emphasizing transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct at all levels of the organization. This could involve restructuring incentive programs to discourage unethical sales practices and fostering a culture that prioritizes the well-being of employees and customers above financial gains.
