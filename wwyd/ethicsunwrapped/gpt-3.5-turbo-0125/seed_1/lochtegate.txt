I would conduct a thorough investigation into the incident, gathering all available evidence, including witness statements, surveillance footage, and any official reports from the Brazilian authorities. I would also interview Lochte and the other swimmers involved to get their firsthand accounts of what transpired that night. Based on the findings of the investigation, I would work with legal counsel to determine the appropriate course of action, whether it be issuing a public statement, offering further apologies, or taking any necessary disciplinary measures. Additionally, I would provide support and guidance to Lochte as he navigates the aftermath of the incident, including assisting him in fulfilling his community service requirements and helping him make amends for the negative impact his actions had on the reputation of American athletes and the host city of Rio de Janeiro.
