In response to the incident at the Starbucks location in Philadelphia involving the arrest of Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Conduct a thorough investigation into the incident, including interviewing the employees involved, reviewing any relevant security footage, and obtaining statements from witnesses to understand exactly what happened and why the decision to involve the police was made.

2. Provide cultural sensitivity and anti-bias training to all employees at the Philadelphia location, focusing on implicit bias, discrimination, and de-escalation techniques to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

3. Meet with Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson to personally apologize for the way they were treated and offer any support or resources they may need as a result of the traumatic experience.

4. Implement a clear policy that outlines when it is appropriate to involve law enforcement in situations at Starbucks locations, ensuring that the decision is based on legitimate concerns for safety and not influenced by bias or discrimination.

5. Engage with community leaders and organizations in Philadelphia to address concerns about racial profiling and discrimination, seeking their input on how Starbucks can better serve and support the local community.

6. Publicly acknowledge and take responsibility for the incident, ensuring transparency in the actions taken to address the issue and prevent similar incidents in the future.
