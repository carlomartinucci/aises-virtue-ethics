In response to this scenario, I would recommend conducting further research to understand the underlying psychological mechanisms behind the phenomenon of moral licensing observed in consumers who purchase green products. This research could involve conducting surveys or experiments to explore factors such as individual values, attitudes, and motivations that may influence consumer behavior in these situations. By gaining a deeper understanding of these drivers, businesses and policymakers could develop strategies to mitigate the negative effects of moral licensing and promote more ethical decision-making among consumers.
