I would prioritize the well-being and health of the affected athletes by ensuring they have access to comprehensive medical care and support. This includes providing specialized medical services to address the physical and psychological effects of the doping. I would work with healthcare professionals to develop individualized treatment plans and counseling services for the athletes to address their specific needs and concerns resulting from the doping regimen. Additionally, I would collaborate with relevant organizations to raise awareness about the long-term health consequences of performance-enhancing drug use in sports and advocate for stricter anti-doping measures to prevent similar situations in the future.
