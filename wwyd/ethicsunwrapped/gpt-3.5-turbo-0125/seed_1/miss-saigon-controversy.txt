I would acknowledge the concerns raised by Asian American actor B.D. Wong and the Actors' Equity Association regarding the casting of a white actor, Jonathan Pryce, in the role of the Eurasian character 'the Engineer' in Miss Saigon. I would take the following specific actions:

1. Engage in dialogue with Asian American advocacy groups and community leaders to better understand their perspectives and concerns about the impact of "yellow-face" casting on Asian representation in the performing arts.

2. Conduct a thorough review of the casting process for future productions to ensure that roles are cast authentically and respectfully, considering the importance of representation and diversity on stage.

3. Work with casting directors to actively seek out and audition Asian actors for roles that are written specifically for Asian characters, prioritizing inclusivity and diversity in the casting decisions.

4. Collaborate with the creative team and producers to explore ways to address the controversy surrounding the casting of Jonathan Pryce in Miss Saigon, such as organizing community discussions or educational initiatives on cultural sensitivity in casting.

5. Implement guidelines and best practices for casting decisions in future productions to promote diversity and authenticity in representation, while also recognizing and addressing historical issues of racial stereotyping in the performing arts.
