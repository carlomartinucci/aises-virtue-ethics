I would conduct thorough research on the cultural, historical, and ethical aspects of bullfighting to gain a comprehensive understanding of the different perspectives involved. This would involve studying the origins of bullfighting, its evolution over time, the cultural significance attached to it, as well as the arguments presented by both supporters and critics of the practice. I would also seek out scholarly articles, books, and opinions from various experts in the fields of animal welfare, cultural studies, and ethics to inform my knowledge on the subject. Additionally, I would make an effort to engage in constructive dialogues with individuals holding varying viewpoints on bullfighting to gain a more nuanced understanding of the complexities surrounding the issue.
