Given the scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Review Pao's performance evaluations and feedback to understand the basis for the negative criticisms she received consistently each year.

2. Analyze the evidence presented during the trial, including evaluations, meeting summaries, and messages, to assess whether there were instances of discriminatory behavior or retaliation against Pao.

3. Investigate the specific allegations made by Pao regarding harassment, exclusion from meetings, and the lack of policies to prevent discrimination at the firm to determine the validity and extent of these claims.

4. Examine the job descriptions and responsibilities of Pao and her male counterparts to assess if there were disparities in opportunities for advancement and involvement in investment activities.

5. Evaluate the arguments put forth by both Pao's legal team and Kleiner Perkins to understand the reasoning behind the decisions made regarding Pao's promotion and termination.

6. Consider the perspectives of the jurors who voted in favor of both Pao and Kleiner Perkins to gain insights into the different interpretations of the evidence presented during the trial.

7. Reflect on the broader implications of the case in prompting discussions about gender discrimination and harassment in the tech industry and venture capital sector.
