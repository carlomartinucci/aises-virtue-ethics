I would ensure that Stangl's crimes and his role in the Holocaust are accurately documented and preserved in historical records. This would involve collaborating with historians, researchers, and Holocaust memorials to gather information, testimonies, and evidence related to Stangl's actions at Hartheim Castle, Sobib√≥r, and Treblinka. This documentation would help educate future generations about the atrocities committed during the Holocaust and serve as a reminder of the consequences of individuals' actions in times of moral crisis.
