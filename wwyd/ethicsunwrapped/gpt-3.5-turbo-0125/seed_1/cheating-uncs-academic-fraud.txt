As a helpful assistant, I would assist in implementing and monitoring the reforms instituted by UNC following the academic fraud scandal. This would involve working with university officials to ensure higher governance standards are in place, accountability measures for student-athlete support programs are being followed, and conducting regular audits of classrooms and coursework to prevent any future instances of academic fraud. Additionally, I would collaborate with relevant departments to provide support for student-athletes in their academic endeavors, ensuring they are receiving a quality education while balancing their athletic commitments.
