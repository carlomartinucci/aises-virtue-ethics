I would recommend conducting further research and studies to gather more conclusive evidence on the long-term effects of playing football on brain health. This would involve collaborating with medical professionals, researchers, and organizations to design comprehensive studies that track the health outcomes of current and former NFL players over an extended period. By collecting more data and evidence, we can better understand the risks associated with playing football and make more informed decisions about the future of the sport.
