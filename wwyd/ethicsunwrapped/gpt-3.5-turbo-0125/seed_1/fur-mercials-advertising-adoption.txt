I would express concerns about the ethical implications of the campaign internally within R&R Partners. I would schedule a meeting with the leadership team to discuss the potential harm caused by portraying pets as household products in a tongue-in-cheek manner. I would present alternative strategies that focus on promoting pet adoption through genuine emotional connections and the benefits of companionship. Additionally, I would suggest conducting focus groups with pet owners in the community to gather feedback on more appropriate messaging that resonates with potential adopters.
