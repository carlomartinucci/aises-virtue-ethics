If I were in this situation, I would report the sign-stealing scheme to MLB officials immediately. I would provide all relevant details and evidence available, including the use of the algorithm, the trash can banging scheme, and the involvement of key personnel such as players, manager, and general manager. It is crucial to ensure that the league is aware of these violations of the rules and regulations, and that appropriate actions are taken to address the cheating scandal and uphold the integrity of the game.
