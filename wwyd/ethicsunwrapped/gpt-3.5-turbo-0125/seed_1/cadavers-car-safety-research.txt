I would work with the researchers at Heidelberg University to review their research protocols and ensure that proper consent procedures were followed for the use of human cadavers in the car crash tests. I would also facilitate discussions with relevant stakeholders, including the families of the deceased individuals, to address concerns about the ethical implications of the research. Additionally, I would collaborate with experts in the field to explore alternative methods that could achieve similar research goals without using human cadavers, such as advanced crash test dummies or computer simulations.
