In this scenario, if I were Shepard Fairey's assistant, I would research and gather all relevant information regarding the original photo by Mannie Garcia, the copyright ownership, Fairey's transformation process, and the legal implications of the case. I would assist in organizing these details for Fairey's legal team to use in court to support the argument of fair use and transformative purpose. Additionally, I would help coordinate communication between Fairey, his lawyers, Mannie Garcia, and The A.P. to explore potential resolutions and negotiations that could lead to a settlement beneficial to all parties involved.
