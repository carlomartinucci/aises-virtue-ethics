In response to the situation at Baylor University involving Art Briles and the football program:

I would immediately report any new information or evidence regarding sexual assault or misconduct involving football players to the appropriate university officials, such as the Title IX coordinator or other responsible authorities. It is crucial to ensure that victims are supported, and that proper investigations and actions are taken to address any wrongdoing and protect the safety of all students on campus.
