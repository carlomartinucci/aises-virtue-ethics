In this scenario, I would ensure that the research team at the Boyce Thompson Institute (BTI) for Plant Research conducts a thorough internal review of its research practices and quality control procedures. This review should include a reassessment of the experimental methods used in the disputed study, as well as an evaluation of the oversight and collaboration among co-authors in the publication process. Additionally, I would recommend implementing stricter protocols for data validation and replication within the laboratory to prevent similar issues in the future. It is crucial to prioritize scientific integrity and maintain transparency to uphold the credibility of research findings within the scientific community.
