If I were involved in the management or oversight of Paralympic sports, I would take the following specific actions to address the issue of cheating in the classification system:

1. Implement stricter and more thorough pre-competition evaluations for athletes, including random checks and assessments to ensure that their declared disabilities align with their actual impairments.

2. Develop standardized protocols and guidelines for classification assessments that are consistently applied across all sports and countries to prevent discrepancies and manipulation.

3. Increase transparency in the classification process by making detailed information and documentation publicly available to promote accountability and discourage fraudulent behavior.

4. Conduct regular training and education sessions for athletes, coaches, and staff on the importance of fair play, ethical behavior, and the consequences of cheating in Paralympic sports.

5. Collaborate with international sports organizations and anti-doping agencies to share best practices and strategies for detecting and deterring cheating in the Paralympic movement.

By taking these specific steps, we can work towards maintaining the integrity and credibility of the Paralympic Games and ensuring that all athletes compete on a level playing field based on their genuine abilities and disabilities.
