If I were in a similar situation, I would immediately report Rick Singer's illegal activities to the authorities, specifically the FBI or local law enforcement. I would provide detailed information about Singer's tactics, including the exploitation of underpaid coaches, the bribery of test administrators, and the manipulation of standardized test scores. Additionally, I would disclose the involvement of wealthy families, such as Douglas Hodge, Gordie Caplan, Felicity Huffman, and Jane Buckingham, in the fraudulent schemes.

I would cooperate fully with the investigation, offering any evidence or documentation that could assist in uncovering the extent of the fraud and bringing all those involved to justice. It is essential to ensure that the integrity of the college admissions process is upheld and that individuals like Rick Singer are held accountable for their illegal actions.
