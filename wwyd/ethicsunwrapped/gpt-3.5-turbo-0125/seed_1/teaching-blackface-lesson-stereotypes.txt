In this scenario, I would first gather all the necessary information regarding the incident, including the content of the video shown by Alan Barron, the context in which it was presented, and the reactions of the students and parents involved. I would then schedule a meeting with the assistant principal who interrupted the lesson to understand her perspective and reasoning behind stopping the video.

Next, I would meet with Alan Barron to discuss his intentions behind showing the video, how he framed the lesson, and his response to the assistant principal's intervention. I would also inquire about his approach to discussing sensitive topics like racism in the classroom and how he ensures that such discussions are respectful and educational for all students.

Furthermore, I would organize a meeting with the parents who supported Alan Barron, including Adrienne Aaron, to listen to their perspectives on the incident and gather feedback on how the school can better address issues of race and history in the curriculum.

Finally, I would work with the school administration to review the school's policies and guidelines on teaching sensitive topics, such as racism, to ensure that teachers are supported in facilitating meaningful discussions while maintaining a safe and inclusive learning environment for all students.
