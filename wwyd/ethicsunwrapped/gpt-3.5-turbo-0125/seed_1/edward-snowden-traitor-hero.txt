Given the scenario, I would suggest that in order to address the complexity of Edward Snowden's actions, it would be important to carefully evaluate the specific content of the information that he disclosed to the public. One concrete action that could be taken is to convene a panel of legal and ethical experts to conduct a thorough analysis of the leaked documents. This panel could assess the potential harm caused by the disclosure of the information, as well as the extent to which the public interest was served by making these details known. This analysis would involve considering the implications of the surveillance programs on privacy rights and national security. Additionally, the panel could examine whether there were alternative, legal channels available to Snowden for reporting his concerns within the existing framework of government oversight. Gathering this information would help in determining the ethical and legal implications of Snowden's actions and in guiding any potential decisions regarding accountability.
