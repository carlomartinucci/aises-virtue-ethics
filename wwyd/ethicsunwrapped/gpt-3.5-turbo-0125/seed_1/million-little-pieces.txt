I would advise Doubleday to publicly acknowledge the inaccuracies and fabrications in James Frey's book, A Million Little Pieces. They should apologize to the readers who were misled by marketing the book as a memoir when it contained exaggerated and false elements. Additionally, they should offer refunds or exchanges to customers who purchased the book under false pretenses. Doubleday should also take steps to ensure that future publications are thoroughly fact-checked and vetted to maintain credibility with their audience.
