I would conduct research to gather data and information on the impact of laws prohibiting abortions based solely on a diagnosis of Down Syndrome. This research would include studying the effects of such laws on access to healthcare, the rights and choices of individuals and families, as well as the well-being of individuals with Down Syndrome. Additionally, I would reach out to medical professionals, advocacy groups, and individuals directly affected by Down Syndrome to gather diverse perspectives and insights on the potential implications of such legislation. This comprehensive research would provide a solid foundation for understanding the complexities of the issue and informing any further actions or recommendations.
