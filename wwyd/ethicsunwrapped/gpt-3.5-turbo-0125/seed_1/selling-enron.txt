I would gather evidence of the unethical practices within Enron's energy trading group, including the schemes mentioned in the scenario such as submitting false demand schedules, filing imaginary transmission schedules, and selling services that Enron did not have. I would document how these actions directly impacted electricity prices and contributed to rolling blackouts in California.

Next, I would confidentially report these findings to relevant authorities, such as regulatory agencies or law enforcement, to investigate Enron's fraudulent activities and hold those responsible accountable. Additionally, I would ensure that all information provided is accurate and detailed to support any investigations or legal actions that may follow.
