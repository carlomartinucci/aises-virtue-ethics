I would conduct a thorough investigation into Apple's supply chain to verify the claims made by critics regarding the dangerous working conditions in the overseas mines where tin is sourced. This investigation would involve collecting data from various sources, such as reports from independent organizations, interviews with workers in the supply chain, and on-site inspections of the mining operations.

Based on the findings of the investigation, I would work with Apple's management team to develop a comprehensive plan to address the ethical concerns raised by the unsafe working conditions in the mines. This plan would include steps to improve monitoring and regulation of the component sources, as well as measures to ensure the safety and well-being of the workers involved in the production of Apple's products.

Additionally, I would collaborate with relevant stakeholders, such as local authorities, NGOs, and other companies in the industry, to collectively work towards improving the overall supply chain practices and promoting responsible sourcing of materials. This collaborative approach would help drive positive changes on the ground and contribute to the long-term sustainability of the supply chain.

Finally, I would recommend that Apple continues to enhance its transparency efforts by regularly updating and publishing detailed reports on their supplier relationships and progress in addressing labor practices. This transparency would help build trust with consumers and stakeholders and demonstrate Apple's commitment to ethical business practices.
