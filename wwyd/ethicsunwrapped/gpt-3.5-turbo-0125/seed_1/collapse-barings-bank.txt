Given the scenario involving the collapse of Barings Bank due to Nick Leeson's actions, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Implement stricter oversight measures for all traders, including regular and thorough reviews of trading activities to detect any irregularities or unauthorized transactions.

2. Establish a clear and transparent reporting system for any losses or discrepancies, encouraging employees to speak up without fear of reprisal.

3. Conduct a comprehensive review of risk management practices and procedures to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future.

4. Enhance training programs for traders and management on ethical decision-making, risk management, and the importance of honesty and accountability in financial institutions.

5. Collaborate with regulatory authorities to strengthen regulatory oversight and compliance requirements to prevent fraudulent activities and protect the stability of the financial system.
