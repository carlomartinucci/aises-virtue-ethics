In this scenario, I would schedule a consultation with a supervisor or a colleague who is experienced in ethical decision-making in social work practice. During the consultation, I would seek guidance on how to navigate the conflict between my religious beliefs and the ethical obligation to provide non-biased mental health treatment to the client. I would discuss the potential implications of transferring the client to another therapist and explore alternative solutions that would uphold the client's best interests while addressing my personal beliefs. Ultimately, I would follow the guidance provided during the consultation to ensure that the client receives appropriate care and support.
