I would thoroughly review and analyze the financial records and documentation of Tyco International during Dennis Kozlowski's tenure as CEO to verify the accuracy of his statement that all information prosecutors obtained was directly from the company's books and records. This would involve examining the details of the unauthorized bonuses, large purchases, investments, and any irregular financial transactions to determine if they were indeed recorded in the company's official records. Additionally, I would investigate the authorization processes in place within Tyco to understand whether Kozlowski had the proper authority to make those financial decisions. This detailed examination would help ascertain the facts surrounding the financial misconduct allegations and provide clarity on the legitimacy of the charges brought against Kozlowski.
