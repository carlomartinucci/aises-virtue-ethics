If I were involved in the Therac-25 incident, I would immediately prioritize patient safety above all else. I would proactively communicate with all relevant stakeholders, including patients, healthcare professionals, regulatory agencies, and the public, to ensure transparency about the situation and the steps being taken to address the issues. I would work diligently to identify and rectify all software and hardware problems within the Therac-25 machines, conducting thorough testing and validation to guarantee their safety and efficacy before allowing them to be used again for patient treatments. Additionally, I would advocate for comprehensive investigations into the root causes of the incidents, holding individuals and organizations accountable for any negligence or misconduct that contributed to the harm experienced by patients.
