I would advise Albert Snyder to seek counseling and support to help him cope with the emotional distress caused by the Westboro Baptist Church's actions at his son's funeral. I would recommend connecting him with mental health professionals and support groups specializing in grief and trauma to assist him in processing his emotions and developing coping strategies. Additionally, I would suggest exploring legal options for potential future actions or advocacy efforts aimed at promoting legislation to protect individuals in similar situations from such distressing experiences.
