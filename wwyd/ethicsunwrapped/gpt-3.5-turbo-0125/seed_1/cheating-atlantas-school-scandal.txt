I would refuse to change the answers on the standardized tests, even if pressured by the principal or other teachers. I would document any attempts to coerce me into cheating, and report the situation to the appropriate authorities within the school district or educational board. I would prioritize the integrity of the testing process and the ethical standards of my profession, even if it meant facing potential consequences for not complying with the cheating scheme.
