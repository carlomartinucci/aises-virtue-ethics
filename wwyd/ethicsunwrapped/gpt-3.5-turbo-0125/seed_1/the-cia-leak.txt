In this scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Review the facts and legal context surrounding the pardon of Scooter Libby by President Donald Trump in 2018.
2. Assess the impact of the pardon on national security, particularly in relation to the safety of covert operatives and the operations of the CIA, as highlighted by Valerie Plame.
3. Consider reaching out to relevant experts in national security and intelligence to gather additional insights on the potential consequences of the pardon.
4. Prepare a detailed analysis or briefing outlining the potential risks and implications of the pardon on national security, with a focus on CIA operations and the safety of covert agents.
5. Present this analysis to senior officials within the government or relevant oversight bodies to ensure that the concerns raised by Plame and others are taken into account and addressed appropriately.
