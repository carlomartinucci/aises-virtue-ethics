I would approach Mary after the event and express my concern about the misperception Robert had regarding the shelter's clientele. I would suggest that it is important for donors to have accurate information about the organization they are supporting. I would recommend that in future interactions with donors, we should ensure that they understand the true nature of Casa Tia Maria's work with Central American immigrants. I would also propose that we have a plan in place to address any misunderstandings or misperceptions that may arise during fundraising events to maintain transparency and integrity in our donor relationships.
