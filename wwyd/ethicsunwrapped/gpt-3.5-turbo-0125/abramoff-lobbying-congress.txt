I would conduct a thorough review of my own lobbying activities and client relationships to ensure full transparency and disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest. I would also establish clear guidelines and protocols within my firm to prevent any unethical behavior, such as charging excessive fees or misleading clients. Additionally, I would prioritize building strong, honest relationships with clients based on mutual trust and respect, rather than exploiting them for personal gain.
