I would acknowledge the complexity of the situation and the importance of addressing drug addiction as a public health issue. I would also emphasize the need for compassion and support for individuals struggling with addiction, including Rush Limbaugh. I would advocate for a balanced approach that combines accountability for illegal actions with access to treatment and rehabilitation services. Additionally, I would encourage open discussions about addiction, mental health, and the stigma surrounding seeking help.
