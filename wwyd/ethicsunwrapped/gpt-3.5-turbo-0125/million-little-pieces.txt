If I were in this scenario, I would acknowledge the seriousness of the situation and take immediate action by issuing a public statement on behalf of the publisher, Doubleday. In the statement, I would express our regret for any misrepresentation that may have occurred in marketing James Frey's book as a memoir. I would also announce that we are conducting a thorough review of the book's content and any inaccuracies found will be addressed transparently.

Furthermore, I would reach out to Oprah Winfrey's team to express our willingness to cooperate fully with any investigations or discussions they may wish to have regarding the controversy. It is crucial to demonstrate our commitment to integrity and transparency in handling this issue.

Additionally, I would initiate internal discussions with the editorial and marketing teams to review our processes for vetting and fact-checking memoirs and other non-fiction works. This would involve implementing stricter guidelines and procedures to ensure that future publications are accurately represented to readers.

Overall, my goal would be to address the concerns raised by the controversy, take responsibility for any shortcomings, and work towards rebuilding trust with readers, authors, and the literary community.
