I would take the following specific actions in this scenario:

1. Provide support and resources for the affected athletes who were victims of the doping program, including medical assistance for the physical and psychological consequences they may be facing.
  
2. Collaborate with relevant authorities and organizations to investigate and hold accountable the coaches, doctors, and officials responsible for implementing and enforcing the doping program.

3. Advocate for transparency and education within the sports community to prevent similar incidents of doping and ensure the well-being and integrity of athletes.

4. Raise awareness about the long-term health risks associated with performance-enhancing drugs and provide counseling services for athletes who may have been coerced or pressured into doping.

5. Work towards implementing stricter regulations and monitoring mechanisms in sports to prevent the abuse of performance-enhancing substances and protect the rights and health of athletes.
