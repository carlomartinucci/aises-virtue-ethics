I would advise Dr. Jones to carefully consider the potential consequences of her actions before deciding how to proceed. She should first gather more information and evidence to support her concerns about the efficacy of flu shots for the elderly. Dr. Jones could explore the possibility of discussing her reservations with her colleagues or seeking guidance from other medical professionals who have expertise in vaccination effectiveness.

Based on the information gathered, Dr. Jones could consider approaching her hospital administration to express her concerns in a respectful and professional manner. She could request a meeting to present the research findings she has come across and propose a discussion on how best to address this issue within the hospital's vaccination policies.

Additionally, Dr. Jones could explore alternative ways to educate her senior patients about the potential limitations of flu shots for their age group. She could consider providing them with resources or information on the latest research findings regarding flu vaccine effectiveness and adverse events. This would empower her patients to make informed decisions about their healthcare.

Ultimately, Dr. Jones should prioritize the well-being of her patients while also being mindful of the potential repercussions of her actions on her professional relationships and standing within the medical community. By approaching the situation with caution, thorough research, and open communication, she can navigate this ethical dilemma in a responsible and ethical manner.
