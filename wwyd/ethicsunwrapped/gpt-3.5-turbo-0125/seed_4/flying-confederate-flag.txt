I would offer support and resources to facilitate a peaceful and constructive dialogue between the various stakeholders involved in the debate over the Confederate flag. This could include setting up a moderated public forum where individuals on both sides of the issue can express their perspectives, concerns, and proposed solutions in a respectful manner. Additionally, I would work to ensure that all voices are heard and that the discussions are focused on finding common ground and fostering understanding rather than escalating tensions.
