If I were in this scenario, I would conduct a thorough review of the research protocols and procedures followed by Heidelberg University and Wayne State University regarding the use of human cadavers in simulated car crash tests. I would specifically look into the consent process for obtaining cadavers, ensuring that proper ethical guidelines were followed, and that families were informed and gave their explicit consent for the use of the cadavers in research.

Additionally, I would collaborate with relevant stakeholders, such as medical ethicists, legal experts, and representatives from the affected families, to evaluate the ethical implications of using human cadavers in such research. This would involve facilitating discussions and addressing concerns raised by various groups, including the public, political leaders, and ethical organizations.

Furthermore, I would assess the scientific validity and necessity of using human cadavers in these crash tests compared to alternative methods, such as crash test dummies. This evaluation would help determine whether the unique insights gained from human cadavers justify the ethical considerations involved in their use.

Ultimately, my actions would focus on ensuring transparency, ethical integrity, and accountability in the research practices related to the use of human cadavers in simulated car crash tests.
