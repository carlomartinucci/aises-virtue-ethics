If I were in this scenario, I would report the Astros' sign-stealing scheme to the appropriate authorities, such as the MLB commissioner's office or the league's investigative unit. I would provide any evidence or information I have regarding the "Codebreaker" system, the use of electronic means to decipher signs, and the involvement of players, coaches, and management in the scheme. It is important to ensure that the integrity of the game is upheld and that appropriate action is taken to address the cheating that has occurred.
