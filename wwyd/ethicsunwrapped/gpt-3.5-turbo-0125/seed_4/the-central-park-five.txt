I would first review all the available evidence in the case, including the confessions, witness statements, forensic evidence, and the confession of Matias Reyes. I would then consult with legal experts and advocates for the wrongfully convicted to understand the legal avenues available to potentially overturn the convictions of the Central Park 5.

Next, I would work with the legal team representing the Central Park 5 to file appeals based on the new evidence provided by Matias Reyes' confession and DNA match. I would also assist in gathering additional evidence to support the innocence of the young men, such as expert testimony on false confessions and the lack of physical evidence linking them to the crime.

Additionally, I would work to raise public awareness about the case to counter the misinformation and misconceptions that continue to persist, particularly from individuals like the lead prosecutor, the head detective, and Donald Trump. This could involve organizing public events, engaging with media outlets, and collaborating with advocacy groups to highlight the injustice faced by the Central Park 5 and the importance of addressing systemic issues in the criminal justice system.
