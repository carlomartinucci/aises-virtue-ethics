I would acknowledge the concerns raised by Asian American actor B.D. Wong and the Actors' Equity Association regarding the casting of Jonathan Pryce as the Eurasian character 'the Engineer' in Miss Saigon. I would work with the production team to engage in dialogue with the Asian American community and advocacy groups to better understand the perspective and impact of casting decisions on representation in the performing arts.

Additionally, I would make efforts to actively seek out and audition Asian actors for key roles in future productions to ensure more diverse and authentic representation on stage. This may involve collaborating with talent agencies specializing in Asian performers, attending industry events that showcase Asian talent, and holding open casting calls specifically targeting Asian actors.

Furthermore, I would prioritize the inclusion of diverse voices in the creative process, such as consulting with cultural advisors or hiring Asian American directors and choreographers who can provide insights and feedback on the portrayal of Asian characters and themes in the production.

Overall, my actions would be aimed at promoting inclusivity, diversity, and sensitivity in casting decisions to address the concerns raised about the practice of "yellow-face" in the performing arts.
