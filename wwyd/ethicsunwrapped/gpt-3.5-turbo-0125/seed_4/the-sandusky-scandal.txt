I would have immediately reported the incident to the authorities when graduate assistant coach Mike McQueary came to me with information that he had witnessed Jerry Sandusky fondling a young boy in the football locker room's shower facilities. I would have encouraged McQueary to provide a statement to the police and would have cooperated fully with the authorities in their investigation. Additionally, I would have made sure that the victim received the necessary support and assistance to ensure their safety and well-being.
