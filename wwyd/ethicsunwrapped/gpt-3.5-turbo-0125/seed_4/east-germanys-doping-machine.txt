I would report the systematic doping program in the GDR to the appropriate international sports authorities, such as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). I would provide detailed information about the doping practices, the individuals involved, and the adverse effects experienced by the athletes as a result of the doping program. I would emphasize the ethical violations, health risks, and unfair advantages gained through the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports competitions. Additionally, I would offer to cooperate with any investigations to uncover the extent of the doping program and hold those responsible for these actions accountable.
