If I were in this situation, I would recommend that Doubleday issue a public statement acknowledging the inaccuracies and fabrications in James Frey's book, A Million Little Pieces. The statement should express regret for misleading readers and apologize for any harm caused. Doubleday should offer refunds to readers who feel deceived by the false portrayal of the book as a memoir. Additionally, the publisher should take steps to ensure that all future publications are fact-checked rigorously to maintain credibility and trust with their audience.
