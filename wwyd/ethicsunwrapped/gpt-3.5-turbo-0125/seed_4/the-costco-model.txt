If I were in a position to make decisions at a company similar to Costco, I would focus on implementing policies that prioritize fair wages and comprehensive benefits for employees. This includes conducting regular evaluations to ensure that employees are being compensated fairly based on industry standards and the cost of living in their respective areas. I would also work towards providing opportunities for career advancement and professional development to enhance employee loyalty and engagement. Additionally, I would seek input from employees on a regular basis to address any concerns they may have and to continuously improve the working conditions within the company.
