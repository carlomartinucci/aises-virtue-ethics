I would conduct a thorough investigation into the financial records and transactions of Tyco International during Dennis Kozlowski's tenure as CEO. This investigation would aim to verify the authenticity of the claims made by both Kozlowski and the prosecutors regarding the unauthorized bonuses and other financial misconduct. I would analyze the documentation to determine whether the bonuses were indeed unauthorized and whether there was any criminal intent behind the financial decisions made during that time. Additionally, I would review the company's policies and procedures related to executive compensation and expense approvals to assess whether there were any breaches of compliance that contributed to the situation.
