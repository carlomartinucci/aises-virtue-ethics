I would recommend that Snowden engage in a principled approach to addressing his concerns by first exhausting internal channels within the government to report any perceived wrongdoing. By following established procedures for reporting misconduct, Snowden could have potentially addressed his concerns in a lawful manner and avoided the legal repercussions associated with leaking classified information to the press. This would have allowed for a more balanced consideration of the ethical implications of his actions, while also upholding the rule of law and government processes.
