I would take the following specific actions in response to the Wells Fargo scandal:

1. Review the company's current policies and procedures to ensure they are not incentivizing unethical behavior or creating a toxic work environment.
2. Implement regular training sessions for employees on ethical conduct, emphasizing the importance of honesty and integrity in all dealings with customers.
3. Establish a clear and accessible whistleblowing hotline for employees to report any unethical behavior without fear of retaliation.
4. Conduct a thorough investigation into all allegations of fraud and misconduct, ensuring that appropriate disciplinary action is taken against those responsible.
5. Reach out to affected customers to apologize for the unauthorized accounts and any other harm caused, offering refunds and compensation where necessary.
6. Cooperate fully with regulatory authorities and commit to transparently addressing any concerns raised by shareholders or the public.
7. Consider appointing an independent oversight committee to monitor and report on the company's compliance with ethical standards moving forward.
