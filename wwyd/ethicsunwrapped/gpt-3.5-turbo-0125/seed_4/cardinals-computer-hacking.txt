I would immediately report Chris Correa's actions to the authorities, including the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice, to ensure a thorough investigation into the hacking incident. I would also cooperate fully with the investigation, providing any relevant information or evidence that could assist in the case. Additionally, I would ensure that proper security measures are implemented to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
