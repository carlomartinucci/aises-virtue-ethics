I would ensure that all parties involved in the situation, including Meena Chandok, Daniel Klessig, and other co-authors, are provided with opportunities to discuss and clarify the discrepancies in the research findings. I would facilitate a transparent and open dialogue to understand the reasons behind the inability to replicate the results and address any concerns raised by all parties. Additionally, I would encourage the implementation of rigorous research practices and quality control measures within the laboratory to prevent similar issues in the future.
