Given the scenario, I would consider the following specific actions:

1. Conduct a thorough review of Nixon's medical records to verify the severity of his health condition. This would involve consulting with medical experts and specialists to understand the prognosis of his illness.

2. Request an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding Nixon's admission to Bethesda Naval Hospital and the specific diagnosis of viral pneumonia or phlebitis. This would help clarify any discrepancies in the accounts provided.

3. Engage in transparent communication with the American public about the decision to pardon Nixon, providing detailed reasons for the decision based on the information available at the time. This would involve addressing concerns about the perceived lack of accountability and potential deal-making allegations.

4. Evaluate the potential consequences of the pardon on public trust in the executive branch and consider implementing measures to rebuild that trust, such as increased transparency and accountability mechanisms.

5. Seek advice from legal counsel and constitutional experts to ensure that the pardon was issued in accordance with the law and the Constitution, and to address any legal challenges or criticisms that may arise.

By taking these specific actions, I would aim to address the concerns and criticisms surrounding President Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon in a transparent and accountable manner, while also upholding the integrity of the office of the President.
