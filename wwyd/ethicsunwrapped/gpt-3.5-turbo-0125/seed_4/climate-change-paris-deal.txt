I would work towards raising awareness about the importance of the Paris climate agreement and the need for stronger commitments to combat climate change. This could involve organizing educational events, seminars, and workshops to inform the public about the ethical implications of climate change, especially in terms of global responsibility, intergenerational justice, and fairness. Additionally, I would engage with policymakers and advocate for more ambitious and binding targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, emphasizing the urgency of the situation and the potential catastrophic consequences of inaction. By actively participating in advocacy efforts and promoting dialogue on the ethical dimensions of climate change, I aim to inspire meaningful action towards a more sustainable future for all.
