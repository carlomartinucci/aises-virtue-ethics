I would conduct research to gather as much information as possible about both sides of the argument surrounding bullfighting. This would involve reviewing studies, articles, and testimonies from experts in animal welfare, cultural studies, and ethics to understand the full scope of the issue. Additionally, I would seek out firsthand accounts from individuals involved in bullfighting, both as proponents and opponents, to gain a deeper insight into their perspectives and experiences. This research would help me form a well-rounded understanding of the complexities of the debate and enable me to make informed decisions or recommendations on how to address the ethical concerns surrounding bullfighting.
