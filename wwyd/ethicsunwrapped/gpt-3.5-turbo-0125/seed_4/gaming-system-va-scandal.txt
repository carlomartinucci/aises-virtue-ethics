I would immediately report the clerk's email admitting to gaming the system to the appropriate authorities within the VA, such as the Inspector General's office or the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection. Providing this evidence would help in investigating the manipulation of wait time data and holding those responsible accountable for their actions. Additionally, I would cooperate fully with any investigations or audits to ensure that the true wait times are accurately reported and that veterans receive the care they need in a timely manner.
