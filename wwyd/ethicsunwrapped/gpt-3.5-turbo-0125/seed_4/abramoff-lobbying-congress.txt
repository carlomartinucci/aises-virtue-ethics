If I were in a similar situation, I would ensure full transparency and honesty in all my dealings with clients. I would disclose any potential conflicts of interest to my clients and ensure that they are fully informed about the details of our working relationship. Additionally, I would refrain from making derogatory remarks about clients and treat them with respect and professionalism at all times. Finally, I would prioritize the well-being and interests of my clients above personal gain or influence, striving to act in their best interests at all times.
