Given the scenario presented, if I were in a position to provide guidance or advice to individuals involved in the decision-making process between a stewardship presidency and a strict constructionist model, I would suggest conducting a thorough review of the specific powers granted to the President by the Constitution and Congress. This review should focus on determining the extent to which the proposed actions align with the existing legal framework. Additionally, I would recommend seeking input from legal experts and advisors to ensure that any decisions made are well-informed and legally sound. It is crucial to prioritize upholding the rule of law and adhering to the established procedures and limitations outlined in the governing documents.
