I would first reach out to Summer Morgan, the member of the Kiowa tribe, to better understand the cultural significance of the Plains headdress and its importance in Native American traditions. I would ask for her guidance on how to respectfully address the situation and seek her advice on the appropriate actions to take moving forward. Additionally, I would organize a meeting between Christina Fallin, members of Pink Pony, and Native American representatives to engage in a dialogue about cultural appropriation, educate each other on their perspectives, and work towards a mutual understanding and resolution. It is essential to listen to and learn from the perspectives of those directly affected by the issue and take concrete steps to rectify any harm caused.
