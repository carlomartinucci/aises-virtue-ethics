In this scenario, I would first review the guidelines and policies of the news organization I work for regarding reporting on sensitive topics such as suicide. If there are specific guidelines in place about reporting on suicides, I would adhere to those guidelines.

I would then consider the impact of the detailed reporting on the family and the potential harm it could cause. I would reach out to mental health professionals or organizations for their perspective on the matter to better understand the potential consequences of reporting on suicide methods in detail.

Based on this information, I would discuss internally with my team the ethical implications of reporting on the suicide in a detailed manner. I would advocate for a balanced approach that respects the family's privacy while also providing accurate and informative reporting to the public.

If the decision is made to report on the suicide, I would ensure that the reporting is done in a sensitive and responsible manner, avoiding excessive detail about the method used. I would prioritize the mental well-being of the audience and the potential impact the reporting could have on vulnerable individuals.

Lastly, I would consider reaching out to mental health organizations to provide resources or support for individuals who may be affected by the news coverage of Robin Williams's suicide, ensuring that we are not just reporting the story but also providing assistance to those in need.
