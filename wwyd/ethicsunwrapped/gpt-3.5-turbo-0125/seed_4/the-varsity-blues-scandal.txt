If I were in a position to address this situation, I would report any known instances of academic fraud or unethical practices to the appropriate authorities, such as law enforcement agencies or educational institutions. This would involve providing detailed information about the individuals involved, the methods used to manipulate the system, and any evidence available to support the claims of fraudulent activities. Furthermore, I would cooperate fully with any investigations to ensure that those responsible are held accountable for their actions and that any affected students are given fair opportunities in the college admissions process.
