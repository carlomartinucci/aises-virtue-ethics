I would acknowledge Valerie Plame's concerns about the potential risks to national security and the safety of covert operatives due to President Trump's pardon of Scooter Libby. I would communicate with Plame to understand her perspective further and offer support in exploring potential avenues to address these concerns. This could involve working with relevant stakeholders, such as congressional representatives or advocacy groups, to advocate for increased oversight on presidential pardons related to matters of national security. Additionally, I would assist Plame in raising awareness about the implications of such pardons through public outreach efforts, including media interviews or public speaking engagements.
