Given the scenario, I would immediately report the situation to the appropriate authorities within the law firm, including senior partners or the firm's ethics committee. I would provide a detailed account of the failure to disclose the potential conflicts of interest involving Milbank Tweed, South Street, and Salovaara during the bankruptcy proceedings of BE. I would also recommend conducting an internal investigation to understand the extent of the issue and take necessary corrective actions to address any ethical violations or conflicts of interest that may have occurred.
