I would report Andrew Wakefield's unethical actions and research misconduct to the appropriate authorities, such as the General Medical Council, to ensure that his medical registration is canceled and he faces appropriate consequences for his fraudulent research, conflicts of interest, and failure to disclose critical information. Additionally, I would work to disseminate accurate information about vaccines and their importance to counteract the misinformation spread by Wakefield and prevent further harm to public health.
