If I were in Damany Lewis' position, I would have refused to change students' answers on standardized tests, even if pressured by the principal or colleagues. I would have instead sought alternative ways to support and motivate my students, such as providing additional tutoring, study resources, and encouragement to help them improve their performance. I would have also documented any concerns about potential cheating and reported them to the appropriate authorities to ensure academic integrity and fairness in the assessment process.
