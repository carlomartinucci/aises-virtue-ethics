I would evaluate the impact of the campaign on the overall wellbeing of the animals at the Lied Animal Shelter. This evaluation would include assessing whether the increased adoption rates resulting from the campaign have translated into improved living conditions for the animals, reduced overcrowding, and a decrease in the euthanasia rate. Additionally, I would investigate any potential negative consequences of the advertising campaign, such as promoting pet ownership without emphasizing the responsibilities and commitment involved. This evaluation would involve gathering feedback from shelter staff, volunteers, and animal welfare experts to determine the campaign's real impact on the animals' welfare.
