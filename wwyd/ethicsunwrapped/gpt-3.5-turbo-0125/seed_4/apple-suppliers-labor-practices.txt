I would conduct a thorough investigation into Apple's supply chain to verify the reports of dangerous working conditions in the mines where tin is sourced. This investigation would involve gathering information from various sources, including reports from independent organizations, interviews with workers in the supply chain, and on-site visits to the mines in question. Based on the findings, I would then work with Apple's management to develop and implement a plan to address any violations of labor rights and safety standards in their supply chain. This plan would include steps such as enforcing stricter supplier requirements, providing training and support to improve working conditions, and potentially sourcing tin from mines that adhere to ethical labor practices. Finally, I would monitor the implementation of these measures and regularly assess the progress to ensure that improvements are being made and sustained over time.
