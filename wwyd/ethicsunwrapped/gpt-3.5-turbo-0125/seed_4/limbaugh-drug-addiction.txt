I would review all the available information and gather facts about the situation involving Rush Limbaugh's illegal obtaining of prescription drugs. I would then consult with legal experts to assess whether any further legal action can be taken against Limbaugh based on the evidence. If there are grounds for pursuing legal action, I would work with law enforcement and prosecutors to ensure that justice is served fairly and impartially. Additionally, I would consider advocating for increased awareness and resources for addiction treatment to address the underlying issues that contribute to substance abuse.
