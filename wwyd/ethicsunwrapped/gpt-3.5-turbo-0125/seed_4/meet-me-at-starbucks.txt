I would conduct a thorough investigation into the incident at the Philadelphia Starbucks location. This would involve gathering statements from the employees involved, reviewing security footage, and interviewing witnesses present at the time. Additionally, I would reach out to the individuals who were wrongfully arrested, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson, to offer a personal apology on behalf of Starbucks and to discuss potential compensation for the harm they experienced. Furthermore, I would work with the local community, including leaders and advocacy groups, to address any underlying issues of racial bias and discrimination within the company and to develop concrete action plans to prevent similar incidents in the future.
