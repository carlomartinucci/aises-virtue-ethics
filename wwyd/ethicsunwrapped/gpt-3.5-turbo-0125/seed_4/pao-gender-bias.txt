I would conduct a thorough review of the performance reviews, evaluations, meeting summaries, and messages presented as evidence during the trial to understand the basis of the negative criticisms consistently raised against Ellen Pao each year. This analysis would help me assess the validity of the claims made by both Pao and Kleiner Perkins regarding her performance and behavior in the workplace. Additionally, I would examine any available documentation related to Pao's compensation, bonuses, and job responsibilities to determine if there were discrepancies or biases in these areas. This comprehensive review would provide me with insights into the underlying factors contributing to the legal dispute and help me better understand the dynamics at play within Kleiner Perkins.
