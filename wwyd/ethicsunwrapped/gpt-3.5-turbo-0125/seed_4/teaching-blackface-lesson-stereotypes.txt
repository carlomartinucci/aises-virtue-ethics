In this scenario, I would first meet with Alan Barron to discuss the situation and gather more information about what transpired during the history lesson. I would review the content of the video that was shown and the context in which it was presented to better understand Barron's intentions and educational goals.

Next, I would schedule a meeting with the assistant principal who raised concerns about the lesson to hear her perspective and rationale behind stopping the video. I would aim to facilitate a constructive dialogue between Barron and the assistant principal to address any misunderstandings and ensure that both parties have the opportunity to express their viewpoints.

Furthermore, I would organize a meeting with the parents of the students in Barron's class, including Adrienne Aaron, to gather feedback and insights on their perspectives regarding the lesson and Barron's teaching methods. It is essential to involve parents in the discussion to understand their concerns and ensure that their voices are heard in the decision-making process.

Based on the information gathered from these meetings and discussions, I would work with the school district to conduct a thorough review of the incident and the actions taken, considering the perspectives of all stakeholders involved. This review would aim to clarify any misunderstandings, address any concerns raised, and determine the appropriate course of action moving forward.

Finally, I would ensure that Barron receives the necessary support and guidance to navigate this situation, especially as he approaches his retirement. I would also work towards fostering a more inclusive and culturally sensitive learning environment within the school to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
