In this scenario, I would take immediate action by ensuring that all trading activities are closely monitored and supervised to prevent any unauthorized or risky trades from being made. I would implement strict risk management procedures to regularly review and assess trading positions and profits to detect any discrepancies or irregularities. Additionally, I would establish clear reporting mechanisms for any losses or issues to be escalated to higher management for timely intervention. Lastly, I would conduct thorough audits of all trading accounts to verify their accuracy and legitimacy to prevent any potential fraud or misconduct similar to what occurred with Nick Leeson at Barings Bank.
