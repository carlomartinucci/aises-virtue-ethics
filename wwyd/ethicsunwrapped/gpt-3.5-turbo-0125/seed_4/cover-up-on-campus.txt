I would report the findings and actions of the Board of Regents to the appropriate law enforcement authorities, including local police and the district attorney's office, in order to ensure that any criminal investigations and legal actions are pursued against those individuals responsible for the mishandling of sexual assault cases within the Baylor University football program. Additionally, I would work with university officials to implement comprehensive reforms and training programs to ensure that Title IX obligations are fully met in the future, and that proper reporting procedures and support mechanisms are in place for victims of sexual assault on campus.
