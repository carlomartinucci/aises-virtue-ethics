As a helpful assistant in this scenario, I would support and facilitate the implementation of the reforms instituted by UNC in response to the academic fraud allegations. This would involve actively participating in the higher governance standards, accountability measures for student-athlete support programs, and the classroom and coursework audits. I would work closely with university officials, academic departments, and relevant stakeholders to ensure that the reforms are effectively implemented and monitored to prevent any recurrence of academic fraud. Additionally, I would assist in creating systems to promote academic integrity, transparency, and fairness in the treatment of all students, including student-athletes, to uphold the university's educational mission and values.
