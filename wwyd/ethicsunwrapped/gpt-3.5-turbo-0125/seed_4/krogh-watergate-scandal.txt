Given the scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. I would refuse to participate in any illegal activities, such as the break-in at the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist, and make it clear to my superiors that such actions are not acceptable.
2. I would seek legal advice and guidance from ethics experts to understand the implications of the tasks assigned to me by higher authorities.
3. I would document any concerns I have about the legality and morality of the tasks assigned to me, in order to protect myself and ensure transparency in case of any legal repercussions.
4. I would consider resigning from my position if I am unable to carry out my duties in a lawful and ethical manner, in order to maintain my personal integrity and professional reputation.
