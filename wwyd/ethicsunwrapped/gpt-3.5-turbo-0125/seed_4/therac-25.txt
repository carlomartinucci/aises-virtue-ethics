I would conduct a thorough investigation into the software design and testing processes of the Therac-25 machine. This investigation would include reviewing the software development timeline, examining the testing protocols that were used, and identifying any potential gaps in the software design that could have contributed to the accidents. Additionally, I would analyze the decision-making process that led to reusing software components from earlier versions of the machine without adequate testing for compatibility and safety implications. This investigation would aim to identify specific areas where improvements could have been made to prevent the accidents and ensure the safety of patients using the Therac-25 machine.
