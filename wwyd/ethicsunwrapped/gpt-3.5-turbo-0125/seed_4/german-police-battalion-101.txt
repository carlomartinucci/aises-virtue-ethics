I would take the following specific actions in this scenario:

1. Conduct individual interviews with each member of the reserve police battalion to understand their personal motivations for participating in the mass shootings.
  
2. Provide psychological support and counseling to the members of the battalion to address any trauma or guilt they may be experiencing as a result of their actions.

3. Invite survivors of the mass shootings to share their stories with the battalion members in order to foster empathy and understanding of the consequences of their actions.

4. Organize group therapy sessions for the battalion members to process their experiences together and discuss ways to prevent similar atrocities in the future.

5. Facilitate discussions on moral courage and ethical decision-making to help the battalion members reflect on their choices and consider alternative courses of action they could have taken.
