I would approach Mary privately after the fundraising dinner and express my concerns about Robert's misunderstanding regarding the shelter's clientele. I would suggest that it is important for the organization to be transparent and accurate about who they are serving in order to maintain integrity and avoid any potential miscommunications or misunderstandings with donors. I would recommend that Mary consider reaching out to Robert to clarify the situation and ensure that he is fully informed about the immigrant population that Casa Tia Maria serves. This would help to maintain the organization's credibility and ensure that donors are supporting the cause with accurate information.
