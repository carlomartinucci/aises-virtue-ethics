Given the scenario provided, I would advise Shepard Fairey to collaborate with the original photographer, Mannie Garcia, to reach a mutually agreeable solution regarding the use of the photograph in the "Hope" image. This collaboration could involve negotiating a licensing agreement that compensates Garcia for his original work while also allowing Fairey to continue using the image in his artwork. By working directly with the photographer and acknowledging his rights to the photograph, Fairey can ensure that the appropriate permissions are obtained and that both parties benefit from the continued use of the image.
