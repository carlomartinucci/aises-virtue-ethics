I would advise Thicke and Williams to respect the court's decision and pay the $7.4 million in damages to the Gaye estate, as ruled by the jury. Additionally, I would suggest that they carefully review their future works to ensure they do not inadvertently infringe upon the copyrights of other artists. It would also be prudent for them to be transparent and honest about their creative process in the future to avoid any further legal issues.
