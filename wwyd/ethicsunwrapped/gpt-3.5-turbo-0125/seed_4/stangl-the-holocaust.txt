I would acknowledge the severity of Franz Stangl's actions and the immense suffering he caused to thousands of innocent people. I would also recognize the importance of his trial and the justice served by holding him accountable for his role in the Holocaust. Additionally, I would emphasize the significance of remembering the victims and honoring their memory, as well as educating future generations about the atrocities committed during that dark period in history.
