I would work to gather data and testimonials from various stakeholders, including parents, teachers, administrators, and students, about their experiences and perspectives on high stakes testing. This information would help me understand the specific concerns and impacts of standardized testing within the community. Additionally, I would facilitate open dialogues and forums where these stakeholders can share their views and engage in constructive discussions to find common ground and potential solutions. By actively listening to the concerns of all parties involved, I could help foster a more collaborative approach to addressing the challenges associated with high stakes testing in the educational system.
