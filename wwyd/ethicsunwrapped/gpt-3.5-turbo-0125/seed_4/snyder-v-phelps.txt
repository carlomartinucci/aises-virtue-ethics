I would inform Albert Snyder about potential options he could pursue to cope with the emotional distress and seek support, such as therapy, support groups, or counseling services. I would also suggest exploring legal avenues for recourse, such as appealing to advocacy groups for assistance or seeking ways to raise awareness about the issue to prevent similar incidents in the future. Additionally, I would recommend exploring alternative ways to honor his son's memory and celebrate his life, such as creating a memorial fund or organizing a community event in his son's honor, to focus on positive aspects and healing.
