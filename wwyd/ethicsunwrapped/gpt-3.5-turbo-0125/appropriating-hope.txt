In this scenario, if I were involved in a similar situation, I would first ensure that I have a clear understanding of copyright laws and fair use principles. I would then seek legal advice from intellectual property lawyers to assess the potential risks and implications of appropriating copyrighted material for my artwork. I would also proactively engage in discussions with the original creators or copyright holders to seek permission, credit, and potentially negotiate compensation for the use of their work. If faced with a legal dispute, I would aim to collaborate with all parties involved to find a mutually agreeable resolution, considering the interests and rights of each party while also striving to protect my artistic freedom and expression.
