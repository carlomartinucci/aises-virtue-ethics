I would report Andrew Wakefield's unethical behavior to the appropriate authorities, such as the General Medical Council, providing all the evidence and information I have gathered regarding his actions. This would include his failure to disclose conflicts of interest, manipulation of research data, unethical treatment of research subjects, and misleading statements to the public and press. By reporting Wakefield's misconduct, I would aim to hold him accountable for his actions and prevent further harm caused by his fraudulent research and anti-vaccine advocacy.
