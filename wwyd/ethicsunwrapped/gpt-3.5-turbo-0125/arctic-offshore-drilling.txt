I would conduct a thorough environmental impact assessment of the proposed offshore drilling expansion in Alaska's northwest coast. This assessment would involve studying the potential risks to the local ecosystem, including endangered species like polar bears, walruses, seals, and whales. I would also evaluate the capacity of oil companies, particularly Royal Dutch Shell, to effectively respond to and clean up any potential oil spills in the Arctic waters. Additionally, I would engage with environmental experts, indigenous communities, and other stakeholders to gather diverse perspectives on the potential environmental and social impacts of the drilling expansion. This information would then be used to inform a comprehensive decision-making process that takes into account both the economic benefits and environmental risks associated with the offshore drilling project.
