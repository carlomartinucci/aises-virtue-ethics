I would first acknowledge and reflect on my own biases and beliefs regarding homosexuality and how they may impact my ability to provide unbiased treatment to the client. I would then consult with a supervisor or colleague who is experienced in dealing with similar ethical dilemmas to discuss the situation and seek guidance on how to proceed. If necessary, I would refer the client to another therapist who can provide the needed support and assistance without any conflict of interest. It is important to prioritize the client's well-being and ensure they receive the best possible care, even if it means transferring them to another therapist who can better support their needs.
