I would convene an interdisciplinary team meeting involving the patient's treatment team, including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and ethicists, to discuss the situation. During the meeting, I would present the ethical dilemma of administering the medication covertly to the mentally incompetent patient. The team would be encouraged to openly share their perspectives and concerns regarding the proposed course of action. 

I would ensure that the team thoroughly considers alternatives to covert administration, such as exploring different ways to address the patient's paranoia about being poisoned. The team would also discuss the potential risks and benefits of administering the new medication covertly, taking into account the patient's well-being and autonomy.

After a comprehensive discussion, I would facilitate a decision-making process that includes a consensus among team members on the most ethical and appropriate course of action. This decision would be documented in the patient's medical record, detailing the rationale behind the chosen approach and the steps taken to address the ethical concerns raised by the staff.

Finally, I would ensure that ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the patient's response to the new medication are conducted to assess its effectiveness and any potential adverse effects. Regular team meetings would be scheduled to review the patient's progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.
