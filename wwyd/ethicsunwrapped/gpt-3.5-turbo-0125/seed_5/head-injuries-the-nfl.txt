I would conduct further research into the topic by reviewing the most recent and reputable studies on sports-related concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in NFL players. This would involve analyzing the methodologies, findings, and conclusions of these studies to gain a deeper understanding of the current state of knowledge in this field. Additionally, I would seek out expert opinions and perspectives from neurologists, sports medicine professionals, and ethicists to inform my understanding of the ethical considerations surrounding this issue. This comprehensive review of the literature and consultation with experts would help me form a more nuanced and informed opinion on the morality of supporting football as a spectator sport.
