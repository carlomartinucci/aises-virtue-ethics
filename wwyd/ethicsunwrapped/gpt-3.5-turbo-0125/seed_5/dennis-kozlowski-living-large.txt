I would review the specific financial records and documents presented during the trial to verify the accuracy of Kozlowski's claim that all information was directly from the company's books and records. This would involve analyzing the evidence provided in court, cross-referencing it with the company's financial statements, and consulting with financial experts if needed to determine the validity of Kozlowski's defense.
