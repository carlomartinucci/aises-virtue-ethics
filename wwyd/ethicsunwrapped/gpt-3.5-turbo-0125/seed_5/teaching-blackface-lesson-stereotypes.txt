I would work with the school administration to review the incident and gather all relevant information, including the content of the history lesson, the reactions of the students, and the perspectives of both the teacher and the assistant principal involved. I would facilitate a meeting between Alan Barron, the assistant principal, and any other relevant parties to discuss the concerns raised and to ensure that all viewpoints are heard and understood. Additionally, I would provide support to Alan Barron to help him navigate any lingering consequences of the incident and to ensure a smooth transition as he approaches his retirement.
