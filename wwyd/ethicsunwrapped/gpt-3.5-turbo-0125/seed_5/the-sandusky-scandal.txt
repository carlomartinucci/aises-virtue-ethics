I would have immediately reported the incident involving Sandusky and the young boy to the proper authorities, such as the police or child protective services, to ensure that the victim received the necessary support and that Sandusky could be held accountable for his actions. Additionally, I would have initiated a thorough investigation into the matter within the university to ensure that all appropriate actions were taken to protect the safety and well-being of children on campus.
