In this scenario, I would report the sign-stealing scheme conducted by the Houston Astros to Major League Baseball (MLB) officials. I would provide all the information I have regarding the "Codebreaker" system, including how it was operated, who was involved, and the impact it had on games. It is important to ensure that the integrity of the game is upheld and that appropriate actions are taken to address the cheating scandal. Reporting the misconduct to MLB would be the most concrete and specific action to take in this situation.
