In this scenario, I would first seek to understand the perspectives of both sides - those in favor of high stakes testing and those against it. I would listen to the concerns of parents, teachers, and administrators who are opposed to the current system of standardized testing. Additionally, I would review the available research on the effectiveness of high stakes testing and its impact on students from minority communities.

After gaining a comprehensive understanding of the issue, I would collaborate with educators, administrators, and parents to explore alternative assessment methods that could provide a more holistic evaluation of student performance. This could involve developing a system that includes a combination of standardized testing, teacher evaluations, student portfolios, and project-based assessments.

Furthermore, I would advocate for increased flexibility in curriculum design to allow for a more well-rounded education that includes subjects beyond just reading and math. This could involve working with policymakers to revise the current educational standards to ensure that students are receiving a comprehensive education that prepares them for success in the 21st century.

Overall, my approach would be to engage in open dialogue with all stakeholders, consider alternative assessment methods, and advocate for a more balanced and student-centered approach to education that takes into account the concerns raised by opponents of high stakes testing.
