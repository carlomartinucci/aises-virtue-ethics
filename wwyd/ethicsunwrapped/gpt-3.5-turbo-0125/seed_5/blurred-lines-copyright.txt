I would advise Thicke and Williams to accept the court's ruling and pay the $7.4 million in damages to the Gaye estate. I would recommend that they also publicly acknowledge the influence of Marvin Gaye's music on "Blurred Lines" and express their respect for his work. Additionally, I would suggest that they be more transparent in crediting their sources of inspiration in future projects to avoid similar legal disputes.
