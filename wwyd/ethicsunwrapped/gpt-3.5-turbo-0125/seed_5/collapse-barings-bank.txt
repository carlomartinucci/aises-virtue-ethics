As a member of the management team at Barings Bank, upon discovering the hidden losses and the extent of the problem caused by Nick Leeson's actions, I would immediately convene a crisis meeting with senior executives and legal counsel to assess the full extent of the losses, the impact on the bank's financial stability, and the potential legal implications. I would then contact the relevant regulatory authorities and inform them of the situation, cooperating fully with any investigations.

Additionally, I would work with the senior management team to devise a communication strategy to inform stakeholders, including clients, employees, and regulators, about the situation in a transparent and timely manner. This would involve preparing a detailed explanation of the events, the steps being taken to address the situation, and the measures being implemented to prevent such incidents in the future.

Furthermore, I would collaborate with the legal team to assess the possibility of pursuing legal action against Nick Leeson to recover the losses incurred by the bank. This may involve working with law enforcement agencies to ensure that justice is served and that appropriate consequences are faced for the fraudulent activities that led to the collapse of Barings Bank.
