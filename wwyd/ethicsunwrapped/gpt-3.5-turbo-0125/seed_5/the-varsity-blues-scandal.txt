If I were aware of Rick Singer's unethical practices and the fraudulent actions of the parents involved in the college admissions scandal, I would report this information to the appropriate authorities, such as law enforcement agencies or the FBI, to ensure that justice is served and the individuals responsible for the fraud are held accountable for their actions. This would involve providing all relevant details and evidence that I have regarding Singer's schemes and the parents' involvement in the fraudulent activities. Additionally, I would cooperate fully with any investigations and assist in any way possible to uncover the extent of the wrongdoing and bring those responsible to justice.
