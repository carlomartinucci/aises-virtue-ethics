I would express concern about the ethical implications of the In-FUR-mercial campaign to the leadership at R&R Partners. I would emphasize the importance of promoting pet adoption based on love and companionship rather than treating animals as mere household tools or products. I would suggest revisiting the campaign strategy to ensure that it aligns with promoting responsible pet ownership and the well-being of the animals at the Lied Animal Shelter. Additionally, I would recommend incorporating messaging that highlights the importance of caring for and nurturing pets as valued members of the family, rather than focusing solely on their utility.
