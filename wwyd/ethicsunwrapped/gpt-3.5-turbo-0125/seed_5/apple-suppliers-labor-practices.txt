I would conduct a thorough review of Apple's annual reports on supplier practices to understand the specific actions and changes they have implemented to address the ethical concerns in their supply chain. This review would include examining the steps taken to ensure the safety and fair treatment of workers in the mines where tin is sourced, as well as any environmental impact mitigation measures. After analyzing the reports, I would reach out to Apple's sustainability or supply chain management team to request further details on the specific strategies, programs, and monitoring systems in place to improve working conditions and environmental sustainability in their supply chain. Additionally, I would seek information on any partnerships or collaborations with local organizations or governments aimed at addressing the issues in the mines. This proactive approach would enable me to gain a comprehensive understanding of the actions Apple is taking to address the ethical concerns in their supply chain and assess the effectiveness of their efforts in driving positive changes on the ground.
