I would have ensured that Franz Stangl faced a fair and just trial to hold him accountable for his actions during the Holocaust. This would involve gathering evidence, presenting witnesses, and allowing Stangl the opportunity to defend himself in court. I would have also made sure that the legal proceedings were conducted in accordance with international laws and standards to ensure justice was served for the victims and their families.
