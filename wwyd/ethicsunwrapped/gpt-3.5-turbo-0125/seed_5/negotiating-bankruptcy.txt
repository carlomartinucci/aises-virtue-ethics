If I were in this situation, I would disclose to the bankruptcy judge the connections between Milbank Tweed, South Street, and Mikael Salovaara. I would provide a full and transparent account of the relationships and potential conflicts of interest to ensure that the judge overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings has all the necessary information to make an informed decision regarding the appointment of counsel.
