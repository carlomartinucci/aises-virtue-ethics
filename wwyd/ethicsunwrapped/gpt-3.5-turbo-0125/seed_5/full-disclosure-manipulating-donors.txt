In this scenario, I would approach Mary after the fundraising dinner and express my concerns about the misperception that Robert had about the shelter's clients. I would suggest to Mary that it is important to be transparent and provide accurate information to donors about the population that Casa Tia Maria serves. I would recommend that in the future, we ensure that donors understand that the shelter primarily serves Central American immigrants in need of support.

I would also propose that we take the opportunity to reach out to Robert to clarify the situation and express our gratitude for his donation. I would suggest drafting a thank-you letter that clearly outlines the mission of Casa Tia Maria and the specific ways in which his contribution will benefit the immigrant community that the organization serves. It is essential to maintain transparency and integrity in our interactions with donors to ensure that they fully understand the impact of their support.
