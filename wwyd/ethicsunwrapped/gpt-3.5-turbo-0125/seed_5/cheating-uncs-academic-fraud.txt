I would review the academic records of student-athletes at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill who were involved in the fraudulent classes in the Department of African and Afro-American Studies (AFAM) to determine the extent of the academic fraud and any potential implications for their eligibility to participate in sports. I would also gather information on the individuals responsible for overseeing and facilitating the fraudulent courses, including Julius Nyang’oro, Deborah Crowder, and the counselors in UNC’s Office of Academic Support Program for Student Athletes. Additionally, I would collaborate with relevant stakeholders, such as academic advisors, to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to prevent similar academic fraud in the future.
