I would prioritize the well-being and health of the affected athletes by providing them with comprehensive medical care and counseling services to address the physical and psychological consequences of the doping. This would involve collaborating with healthcare professionals specializing in treating the specific conditions resulting from the performance-enhancing drug use. Additionally, I would ensure that the athletes have access to legal support if they choose to pursue justice or compensation for the harm they suffered. I would also work towards raising awareness about the unethical practices that took place in GDR sports to prevent similar incidents in the future and promote clean, fair competition in sports.
