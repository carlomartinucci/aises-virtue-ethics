Given the scenario, I would carefully review the Code of Conduct for United States Judges to determine if Justice Scalia's actions and statements regarding the Cheney v. U.S. District Court case align with the ethical guidelines outlined in the code. If there are clear violations or conflicts of interest, I would consider reporting the matter to the appropriate judicial authorities for further investigation.
