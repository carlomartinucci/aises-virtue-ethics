I would acknowledge the complexity of the situation, recognizing that Rush Limbaugh's actions contradict his previous statements on drug abuse. I would also emphasize the importance of seeking help for addiction issues and the significance of holding individuals accountable for illegal activities, regardless of their public image or statements. Additionally, I would encourage open discussions about addiction, treatment, and the legal consequences for those involved in illegal drug activities.
