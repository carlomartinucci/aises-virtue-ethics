I would take the following specific actions in response to the Wells Fargo scandal:

1. Conduct a thorough internal investigation to identify all employees involved in the fraudulent account creation and unethical practices.
2. Implement stricter oversight and monitoring mechanisms to prevent unauthorized account openings in the future.
3. Provide support and resources for employees who have suffered from stress, panic attacks, or other symptoms due to the toxic corporate culture.
4. Offer avenues for whistleblowers to report misconduct without fear of retaliation, and ensure that such reports are taken seriously and investigated promptly.
5. Review and revise the company's incentive structures and sales goals to align with ethical standards and customer needs.
6. Publicly acknowledge and take responsibility for the wrongdoing, apologize to affected customers, and commit to making reparations.
7. Cooperate fully with regulatory authorities and implement any recommended changes to prevent future misconduct.
8. Hold accountable senior executives and managers who were aware of or condoned the fraudulent practices, including possible disciplinary actions or removal from their positions.
9. Engage with affected customers to address their concerns, offer restitution where appropriate, and rebuild trust in the bank's services.
10. Communicate transparently with shareholders, regulators, and the public about the steps being taken to address the scandal and prevent similar issues in the future.
