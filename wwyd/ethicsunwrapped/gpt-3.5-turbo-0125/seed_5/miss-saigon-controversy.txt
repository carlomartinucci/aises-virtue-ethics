I would acknowledge the concerns raised by Asian American actor B.D. Wong and the Actors' Equity Association regarding the casting of Jonathan Pryce as the Eurasian character in Miss Saigon. I would take immediate action by engaging in open dialogue with the Asian American community, particularly Asian American actors, to understand their perspectives and experiences regarding representation in the performing arts.

I would also work towards actively promoting diversity and inclusivity in casting practices within the production. This could involve reaching out to Asian American actors for future roles, creating opportunities for them to showcase their talent, and ensuring that roles written for specific ethnicities are portrayed authentically.

Furthermore, I would collaborate with the creative team and producers to explore ways to address the controversy surrounding the casting of Pryce and to navigate the complex issues of representation and diversity on stage. This may involve incorporating feedback from the Asian American community, making changes to future casting decisions, and taking steps to promote cultural sensitivity and awareness within the production.
