I would provide support and resources for individuals and families facing difficult decisions related to prenatal testing and abortion. This could include connecting them with counseling services, medical professionals, and advocacy groups that specialize in supporting individuals with Down syndrome and their families. I would also ensure that accurate and up-to-date information about Down syndrome and available support services is readily accessible to those who may need it. Furthermore, I would work to facilitate open and respectful dialogue between stakeholders on both sides of the debate to promote understanding and empathy for differing perspectives.
