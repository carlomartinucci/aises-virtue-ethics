I would conduct a thorough review of the performance reviews and evaluations of Ellen Pao during her time at Kleiner Perkins to understand the specific criticisms and feedback she received. I would analyze the consistency of these reviews year over year to determine if there were any patterns or discrepancies in the feedback provided to her. Additionally, I would examine any evidence presented during the trial related to Pao's performance and character to better understand the arguments made by both Pao's legal team and Kleiner Perkins' defense team. This analysis would help me gain insight into how Pao's performance was evaluated and whether there were any biases or inconsistencies in the review process.
