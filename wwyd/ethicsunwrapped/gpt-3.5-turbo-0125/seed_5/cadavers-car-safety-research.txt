I would review the research protocol and investigate whether the use of human cadavers in these crash tests was conducted ethically and in accordance with established guidelines and regulations. I would examine whether informed consent was obtained from the families of the deceased individuals and assess the transparency of the research process. Additionally, I would consider the perspectives of various stakeholders, including the public, advocacy groups, political leaders, and officials, to understand the ethical concerns raised. Based on this assessment, I would determine if any violations occurred and take appropriate actions, such as initiating an investigation, imposing sanctions if necessary, and implementing measures to prevent similar ethical lapses in the future.
