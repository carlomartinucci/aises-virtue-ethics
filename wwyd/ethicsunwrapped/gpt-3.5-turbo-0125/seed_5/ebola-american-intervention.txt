Given the scenario, I would conduct a thorough evaluation of the effectiveness and impact of the U.S. military intervention in response to the Ebola epidemic in Liberia. This evaluation would involve analyzing data on the number of patients treated in the military-built treatment units, the timeline of new Ebola cases in Liberia before and after the intervention, and any other relevant metrics to assess the success of the relief effort. Based on this evaluation, I would provide a detailed report to relevant stakeholders, including government officials, health organizations, and the public, to transparently communicate the outcomes of the intervention and any lessons learned for future global health crises.
