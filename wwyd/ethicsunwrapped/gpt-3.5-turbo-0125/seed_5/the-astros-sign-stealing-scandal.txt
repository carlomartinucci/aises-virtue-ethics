If I were in this scenario, I would take the following actions:

1. Report the sign-stealing scheme to the appropriate authorities within the organization, such as the team's owner, the league office, or the players' union, to ensure that the issue is addressed promptly and transparently.
2. Cooperate fully with any investigations conducted by Major League Baseball (MLB) or other relevant authorities, providing any information or evidence that I have regarding the sign-stealing activities.
3. Encourage a culture of integrity and fair play within the team by promoting adherence to MLB rules and ethical standards, and by discouraging any form of cheating or unethical behavior.
4. Support any disciplinary actions or sanctions imposed by MLB or the team's management on individuals involved in the sign-stealing scheme, including players, coaches, or front office staff.
5. Work towards rebuilding trust with fans, players, and the broader baseball community by taking responsibility for the team's actions, implementing corrective measures, and demonstrating a commitment to upholding the integrity of the game.
