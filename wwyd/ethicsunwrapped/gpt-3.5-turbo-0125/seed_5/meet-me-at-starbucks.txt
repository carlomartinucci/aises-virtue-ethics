I would work with the leadership team to conduct a thorough review of the store's policies and procedures regarding customer interactions, including situations involving non-paying customers and the escalation of issues to law enforcement. This review would involve gathering feedback from employees, customers, and community members to identify areas for improvement. Additionally, I would collaborate with diversity and inclusion experts to develop and implement comprehensive training programs for all Starbucks employees to address implicit bias and ensure a welcoming environment for all customers. I would also reach out to the affected individuals to offer a sincere apology, listen to their experiences, and provide any necessary support or compensation.
