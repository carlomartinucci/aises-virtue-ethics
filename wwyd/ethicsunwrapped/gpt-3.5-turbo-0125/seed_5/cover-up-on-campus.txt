I would report the situation to the appropriate authorities within the university, such as the Title IX office or the university administration. I would provide all relevant information and evidence available to ensure that proper investigations are conducted and appropriate actions are taken to address the reports of sexual assault and misconduct involving football players. I would prioritize the safety and well-being of all students and ensure that the university upholds its obligations to address and prevent such incidents in the future.
