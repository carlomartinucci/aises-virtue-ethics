I would work towards advocating for criminal justice reforms to prevent similar miscarriages of justice in the future. This could involve lobbying for mandatory recording of all interrogations, promoting police training on interrogation techniques that avoid coercion, and pushing for legislation that ensures physical evidence must be present to secure a conviction. Additionally, I would support initiatives to educate the public on the prevalence of false confessions and the importance of relying on concrete evidence in criminal cases. By actively engaging with lawmakers, law enforcement agencies, and the community, I aim to prevent wrongful convictions and promote a fairer justice system.
