If I were in this situation, I would report the unethical and illegal business practices of Enron to the appropriate authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or other regulatory bodies. I would gather all the evidence available, including internal communications, trading records, and witness testimonies, to support the allegations of market manipulation and fraud. I would ensure that the information provided is accurate and comprehensive to facilitate a thorough investigation into Enron's activities. Furthermore, I would cooperate fully with investigators and provide any additional assistance needed to uncover the extent of the wrongdoing and hold those responsible accountable for their actions.
