If I were involved in this scenario, I would work towards finding a balance between protecting the rights of artists and ensuring that consumers have access to music in a fair and legal manner. I would support initiatives that promote fair compensation for artists and producers while also exploring innovative ways to distribute music that benefits both creators and consumers. Additionally, I would advocate for transparent and ethical practices within the music industry to address issues related to copyright infringement and compensation for artists.
