Given this scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Conduct a thorough internal review of the editorial process that led to the decision to publish the article about Dr. Essay Anne Vanderbilt, examining the ethical considerations that were taken into account or overlooked.

2. Organize training sessions or workshops for the editorial staff at Grantland to increase their awareness and understanding of issues related to the transgender community and ensure that similar oversights do not occur in the future.

3. Reach out to experts in transgender advocacy and journalism ethics to seek guidance on how to approach sensitive topics and vulnerable populations in reporting, with the goal of improving Grantland's editorial standards and practices.

4. Issue a formal apology to the transgender community, acknowledging the harm caused by the publication of the article and committing to better representation and treatment of transgender individuals in Grantland's future reporting.

5. Establish clear guidelines and protocols for handling stories involving marginalized communities to prevent similar ethical lapses and ensure that Grantland upholds principles of journalistic integrity and sensitivity.
