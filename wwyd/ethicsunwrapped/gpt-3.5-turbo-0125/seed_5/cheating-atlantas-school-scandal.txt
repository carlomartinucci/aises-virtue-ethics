I would have a private conversation with Principal Waller to express my concerns about changing students' test answers. I would explain that while I understand the pressure to meet the test score goals, I believe that altering answers is unethical and goes against my values as an educator. I would suggest alternative strategies to support the students, such as providing additional tutoring, academic support, or counseling to help them improve their performance genuinely. I would also offer to work closely with the principal and other teachers to come up with a plan to help the students succeed without compromising our integrity.
