I would analyze the situation and consider the potential consequences of the pardon for Libby. I would also review the legal and ethical implications of the pardon, taking into account the concerns raised by Plame regarding the safety of covert operatives and the operations of the CIA. Additionally, I would communicate with relevant stakeholders within the government and the intelligence community to discuss the impact of the pardon and any necessary steps to address the concerns raised by Plame.
