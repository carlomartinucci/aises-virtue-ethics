I would recommend establishing a dialogue between supporters of Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft within the Republican Party to facilitate a better understanding of each other's perspectives. This could involve organizing a series of meetings or discussions where both sides have the opportunity to express their views, share their concerns, and work towards finding common ground. By promoting open communication and encouraging mutual respect, it may be possible to bridge the divide between the two factions and prevent further fragmentation within the party.
