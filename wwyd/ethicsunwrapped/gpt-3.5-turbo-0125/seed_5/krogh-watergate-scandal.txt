I would acknowledge the mistakes made in the past and take responsibility for my actions, admitting that I failed to question the legality and morality of the tasks assigned to me. I would reflect on the importance of personal integrity and ethical decision-making in serving as a public servant. Furthermore, I would continue to support legal ethics education and promote integrity in all aspects of professional and personal life.
