Given the situation described, I would recommend that Doubleday issue a public statement acknowledging the inaccuracies and fabrications found in James Frey's book, A Million Little Pieces. The statement should include an apology to readers who may have felt misled by the marketing of the book as a memoir. Additionally, Doubleday should offer refunds to customers who purchased the book based on false pretenses. Finally, Doubleday should review their editorial and fact-checking processes to ensure that future publications uphold a high standard of accuracy and transparency.
