I would report the discrepancies and safety concerns related to the Therac-25 machine to the appropriate regulatory bodies, such as the FDA and relevant medical authorities. I would ensure that all relevant information, including details of the accidents, inadequate repairs, and lack of thorough investigations, is accurately documented and shared with the authorities for further investigation and action. Additionally, I would advocate for more stringent regulations and oversight in the development and maintenance of medical devices to prevent similar incidents in the future.
