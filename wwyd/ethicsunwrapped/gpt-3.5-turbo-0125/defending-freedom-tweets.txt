In this scenario, I would advise Rashard Mendenhall to take the following specific actions:

1. Reach out directly to Champion to express a sincere apology for any harm caused by his tweets and to clarify his intentions behind the statements.
2. Contact the Steelers' organization to schedule a meeting with team officials to discuss the situation and address any concerns they may have regarding his social media presence.
3. Engage with a public relations professional to develop a strategy for future social media posts that align with his personal values while also considering the potential impact on his public image and endorsements.
4. Consider issuing a formal statement on his social media platforms addressing the controversy, expressing regret for any offense caused, and reiterating his commitment to promoting thoughtful dialogue on important issues.
5. Reflect on the feedback received from the public and media to gain insights into how his words are perceived and to make more informed decisions about his online communication in the future.
