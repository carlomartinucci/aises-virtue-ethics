Given the complex and contentious nature of the situation, I would first seek to gather more information and perspectives from a variety of sources, including government officials, human rights advocates, religious institutions, and experts in immigration policy. This would help me better understand the different viewpoints and concerns at play.

Next, I would work to identify potential areas of common ground or compromise among the various stakeholders. This could involve facilitating dialogue between opposing groups, organizing community forums to discuss the issue, or conducting research to identify evidence-based solutions that address both the humanitarian needs of the children and the concerns about border security.

Additionally, I would explore ways to support the implementation of the Obama administration's plan, such as advocating for increased funding for programs in countries of origin to address root causes of migration, or collaborating with local communities to ensure the safe and humane treatment of migrant children who are being transported to other parts of the country.

Overall, my approach would be to engage with all parties involved, listen to their perspectives, and work towards finding practical solutions that balance the need to protect vulnerable children with the imperative of maintaining border security.
