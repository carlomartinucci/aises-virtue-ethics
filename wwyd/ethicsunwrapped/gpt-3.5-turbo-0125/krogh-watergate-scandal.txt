If I were in Egil "Bud" Krogh's position during the meeting where the break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office was proposed and approved, I would have raised concerns about the legality and morality of the operation. I would have pointed out that the proposed action of breaking into the psychiatrist's office to find documents to discredit Ellsberg based on mental health was not only unethical but also illegal. I would have emphasized the importance of upholding the law and respecting individuals' privacy rights, regardless of the perceived national security crisis.

I would have suggested exploring alternative, legal ways to address the leak of sensitive information without resorting to illegal activities. I would have urged for a more thorough examination of the situation to ensure that any actions taken were in compliance with the law and aligned with ethical standards. If necessary, I would have sought guidance from legal experts or authorities to clarify the boundaries of national security measures and the appropriate course of action to take in such a situation.
