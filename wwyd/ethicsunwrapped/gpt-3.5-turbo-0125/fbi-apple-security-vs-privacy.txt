Given the scenario, I would have advised Apple to continue contesting the court order through legal channels while also exploring alternative methods to assist the FBI in accessing the data on the iPhone. This could involve collaborating with cybersecurity experts to find a solution that does not compromise the security and privacy of all iPhone users. Additionally, I would have recommended engaging in further discussions with the FBI to understand their specific needs and concerns, in order to find a mutually agreeable way forward that upholds both national security and individual privacy rights.
