Given the scenario presented, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Conduct a thorough internal investigation within the organization to identify all individuals involved in the sign-stealing scheme, including players, coaches, and front office staff.
2. Cooperate fully with the MLB investigation and provide all relevant information and evidence to assist in uncovering the extent of the cheating.
3. Implement strict policies and procedures to prevent any future instances of cheating or unethical behavior within the organization.
4. Issue a public apology on behalf of the organization to fans, players, and other teams affected by the cheating scandal.
5. Work closely with MLB to determine appropriate disciplinary actions for those involved in the scheme, including potential fines, suspensions, or other penalties.
6. Take steps to rebuild trust and integrity within the organization and the broader baseball community through transparency and accountability.
7. Engage with stakeholders, including players, fans, and sponsors, to address concerns and demonstrate a commitment to upholding the values of fair play and sportsmanship in the future.
