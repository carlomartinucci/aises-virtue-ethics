Given the scenario, I would first conduct a thorough review of the social media policies and guidelines currently in place for the college athletes at the university. I would assess the effectiveness of these policies in preventing incidents similar to those mentioned in the case study.

Next, I would schedule a meeting with the coaching staff, athletic department officials, and possibly student-athlete representatives to discuss the implications of banning or restricting social media use among college athletes. This meeting would aim to gather diverse perspectives on the matter and explore potential alternative solutions that balance the benefits and risks of social media.

Based on the feedback received, I would work towards revising the existing social media policies to incorporate more specific guidelines on appropriate online behavior for college athletes. This could include provisions on maintaining professionalism, avoiding controversial topics, and representing the university positively on social media platforms.

Furthermore, I would consider implementing educational workshops or training sessions for college athletes to raise awareness about the potential consequences of their social media posts and how to use social media responsibly. These sessions could also provide guidance on privacy settings, handling online criticism, and understanding the impact of their online presence on their personal and professional reputation.

Lastly, I would monitor the implementation of the revised social media policies and periodically review their effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with social media use by college athletes. Regular communication with coaches, athletes, and relevant stakeholders would be essential to ensure compliance and address any emerging issues promptly.
