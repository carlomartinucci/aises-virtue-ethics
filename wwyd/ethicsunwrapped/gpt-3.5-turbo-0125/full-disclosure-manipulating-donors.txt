I would approach Mary privately after the fundraising dinner and express my concerns about the misperception that Robert had regarding the shelter's clientele. I would suggest that it is important to be transparent and accurate when discussing Casa Tia Maria's mission and the population it serves. I would recommend that in future interactions with donors, we should ensure that they have a clear understanding of the organization's work and the individuals it supports. Additionally, I would propose that we develop a strategy to address any misunderstandings that may arise during fundraising efforts to maintain the integrity of Casa Tia Maria's mission and values.
