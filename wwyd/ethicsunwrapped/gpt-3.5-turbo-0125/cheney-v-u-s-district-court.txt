I would recommend that Justice Scalia recuse himself from the case to avoid any appearance of bias or impropriety. This would help maintain the public's confidence in the integrity of the judicial process and ensure that the decision-making is fair and impartial. Additionally, I would suggest that Justice Scalia refrain from engaging in social activities with individuals involved in cases before the Court to uphold the ethical standards expected of a Supreme Court Justice.
