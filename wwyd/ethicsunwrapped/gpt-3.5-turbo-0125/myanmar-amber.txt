I would collaborate with other paleontologists, researchers, and stakeholders to establish a transparent and ethical sourcing framework for acquiring Myanmar's amber fossils. This framework would include guidelines for verifying the origins of the fossils to ensure they were obtained through legal and ethical means, without contributing to conflict or exploitation. Additionally, I would advocate for increased awareness among the scientific community and collectors about the ethical implications of purchasing these fossils, encouraging them to prioritize ethical considerations in their acquisitions. By promoting responsible sourcing practices and fostering dialogue on these issues, we can work towards mitigating the negative impacts associated with the extraction and sale of Myanmar's amber fossils.
