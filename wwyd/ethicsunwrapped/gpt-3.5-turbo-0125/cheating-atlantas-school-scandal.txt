I would have refused to change the students' answers on the standardized tests, even if pressured by the principal or other teachers to do so. Instead, I would have sought alternative ways to support the students in their academic progress, such as providing additional tutoring, resources, or counseling to help them improve their performance. I would have also reported any suspicions of cheating or unethical behavior to the appropriate authorities to ensure the integrity of the testing process and maintain the trust of the students and the community.
