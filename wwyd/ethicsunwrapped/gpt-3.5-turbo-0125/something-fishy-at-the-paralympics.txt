I would work with the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) to strengthen the classification system and implement stricter measures to prevent cheating. This could include increasing the frequency of classification assessments, conducting surprise checks to ensure athletes are not misrepresenting their disabilities, and implementing harsh penalties for those found guilty of cheating the system. Additionally, I would support initiatives like the online course launched by Australia to educate athletes, coaches, and staff on the classification process and ethical decision-making. By taking proactive steps to address cheating in the Paralympics, we can uphold the integrity of the games and ensure fair competition for all athletes involved.
