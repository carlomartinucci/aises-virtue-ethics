I would ensure that all employees in the organization are educated on the importance of data security and the consequences of unauthorized access to confidential information. This would involve conducting regular training sessions, implementing strict access controls, and monitoring employee activities to detect any suspicious behavior. Additionally, I would establish clear protocols for reporting any potential security breaches and ensure that all employees understand their responsibility to uphold ethical standards in handling sensitive information.
