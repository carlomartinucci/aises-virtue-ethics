I would immediately report the unethical practices of manipulating wait times to higher authorities within the Veterans Administration. I would provide all evidence available, including the email from the clerk admitting to gaming the system, to ensure a thorough investigation is conducted. I would also offer to assist in any way necessary to help uncover the extent of the issue and hold those responsible accountable for their actions. Additionally, I would work to implement new policies and procedures to prevent such unethical behavior from occurring in the future, prioritizing the well-being and timely care of the veterans who rely on the VA for healthcare services.
