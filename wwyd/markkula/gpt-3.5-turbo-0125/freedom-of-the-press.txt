Carrie should include the topic of the new statue and the jokes surrounding it in her video about trending conversation topics among students on campus. However, she should approach this subject with sensitivity and balance. Carrie can present the topic in a neutral and objective manner, showcasing different perspectives and opinions from students about the statue. By providing a fair representation of the conversation without overly negative or disrespectful commentary, Carrie can fulfill her duty to reflect the student body's discussions while also being mindful of the potential impact on donor relations and university reputation.
