I would advise the editorial staff to hold a meeting to discuss the situation and weigh the potential consequences of their decision. During the meeting, they should consider the ethical implications of removing the quote, such as compromising their journalistic integrity and independence. They should also discuss the financial impact of losing university funding and the potential loss of access to important news sources.

After a thorough discussion, the staff should take a vote on whether to remove the quote or keep it in the article. Regardless of the decision, they should draft a statement explaining their rationale and publish it alongside the article. This will demonstrate transparency and accountability to their readers and the university administration.

If the staff decides to keep the quote in the article, they should communicate their decision respectfully but firmly to the administration. They should emphasize their commitment to journalistic integrity and independence, while also expressing gratitude for the university's support.

If the administration follows through on their threat to reduce funding, the staff should explore alternative sources of funding to ensure the newspaper's sustainability. They could reach out to alumni, local businesses, or other organizations for financial support.

Overall, the staff should prioritize their journalistic principles while also being mindful of the potential consequences of their actions. It is important to strike a balance between maintaining independence and sustaining the newspaper's operations.
