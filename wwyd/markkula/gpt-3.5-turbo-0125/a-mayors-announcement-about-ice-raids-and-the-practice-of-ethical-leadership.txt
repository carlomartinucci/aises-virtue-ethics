Given the scenario, I would first review the specific laws and regulations governing the sharing of information related to ICE raids and the responsibilities of local government officials in sanctuary cities like Oakland. Next, I would assess the validity of the information Mayor Schaaf received through unofficial channels to determine if it was accurate and credible. I would also investigate the claims made by ICE Deputy Director Homan regarding the number of immigrants with criminal records who remain at large in the community to verify the accuracy of the information.

Based on my findings, I would advise Mayor Schaaf to issue a public statement clarifying her decision to announce the ICE raids, addressing the concerns raised by critics, and providing evidence to support her actions. I would recommend that she emphasize the importance of transparency and integrity in public service, while also highlighting the legal and ethical considerations that guided her decision-making process. Additionally, I would suggest that Mayor Schaaf work with legal experts and community leaders to develop a more strategic and effective approach for communicating with the immigrant community in the future to ensure their safety and well-being.
