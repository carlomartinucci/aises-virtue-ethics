I would review the process and technology used by First Date to verify user avatars against photo IDs to ensure that it is secure and respects user privacy. I would also assess the potential risks and implications of storing and handling sensitive user information, such as photo IDs. Additionally, I would investigate the measures in place to protect user data from breaches or unauthorized access. If any concerns or gaps are identified, I would recommend implementing additional security measures or privacy safeguards to protect user information.
