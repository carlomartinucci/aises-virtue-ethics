I would immediately address the client's expressed desire to stalk Susan and her new boyfriend. I would emphasize the importance of respecting others' boundaries and privacy, and discuss the potential legal and ethical consequences of such behavior. I would explore the client's feelings of rejection and jealousy, helping him to understand and manage these emotions in a healthy way. Additionally, I would work with the client to develop coping strategies for dealing with rejection and improving his self-esteem. If necessary, I would consider involving other mental health professionals or support systems to ensure the client's safety and well-being.
