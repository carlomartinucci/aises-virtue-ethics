I would schedule a meeting with Jerome to discuss his situation in detail. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about his recent relapse and the importance of consistent attendance in the program for successful recovery. I would also inquire about his current living situation, support system, and willingness to commit to the program's requirements moving forward.

Given Jerome's history and the severity of his addiction, I would recommend exploring alternative treatment options, such as intensive outpatient programs or counseling services that may provide more support and structure than the current program. I would also offer to assist Jerome in finding resources for inpatient treatment, despite the challenges with availability and insurance coverage.

I would emphasize the importance of addressing the underlying issues contributing to Jerome's addiction, such as his past experiences and potential barriers to treatment. I would work collaboratively with Jerome to create a personalized treatment plan that takes into account his unique needs and challenges, while also considering the program's policies and limitations.

Ultimately, I would strive to support Jerome in his recovery journey while balancing the need for accountability and adherence to program guidelines. I would continue to advocate for increased access to treatment resources for all individuals struggling with addiction in the community, regardless of race or background.
