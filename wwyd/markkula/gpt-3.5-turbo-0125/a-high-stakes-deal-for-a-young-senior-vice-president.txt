Tim should firmly refuse to sign the altered agreement and reject the envelope filled with cash from Sam. He should explain to Sam that he cannot compromise his integrity and that accepting the bribe goes against his personal values and professional ethics. Tim should emphasize that he is committed to conducting business honestly and transparently, and that he will not engage in any unethical behavior, regardless of the consequences.

After refusing the bribe, Tim should immediately report the incident to his boss and the company's ethics committee. He should provide a detailed account of what transpired, including the altered agreement and the attempted bribe. Tim should also seek guidance from the company's legal department on how to proceed with the deal in a lawful and ethical manner.

Furthermore, Tim should document the entire incident, including any conversations or interactions with Sam, to protect himself in case of any future repercussions or legal issues. He should also seek support from his colleagues or a mentor within the company to help him navigate the situation and deal with the pressure he is facing.

By taking these actions, Tim can uphold his integrity, protect his reputation, and demonstrate his commitment to ethical business practices, even in the face of significant challenges and temptations.
