I would schedule a dedicated appointment with the patient to openly and empathetically discuss his concerns about contracting syphilis. During the conversation, I would validate his feelings and explore the reasons behind his beliefs. I would gently remind him of his negative test results and inquire about any recent experiences or information that may have triggered this specific fear. I would also address his inconsistency about his sexual activity and try to understand the underlying issues contributing to his confusion.

Additionally, I would collaborate with other healthcare professionals, such as infectious disease specialists or internal medicine doctors, to further investigate the patient's concerns about syphilis. This interdisciplinary approach could help provide concrete evidence to reassure the patient and address any potential medical issues that may be contributing to his symptoms.

Furthermore, I would adjust my treatment approach to incorporate psychoeducation about schizophrenia and its potential impact on perceptions and beliefs. By providing psychoeducation tailored to his individual needs, I aim to enhance his understanding of his condition and build trust in our therapeutic relationship.

Lastly, I would closely monitor the patient's mental health status and continue to engage in regular follow-up appointments to assess his response to treatment and address any emerging concerns or symptoms promptly.
