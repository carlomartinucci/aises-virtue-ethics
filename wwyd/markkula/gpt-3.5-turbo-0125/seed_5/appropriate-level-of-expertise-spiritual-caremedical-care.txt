I would express my concern for John's well-being and gently but firmly encourage him to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in depression and substance abuse. I would emphasize that seeking help does not mean he is weak or failing his family, but rather taking the necessary steps to ensure his mental and physical health during a challenging time. I would offer to assist him in finding a suitable therapist or counselor and continue to support him through prayer and spiritual guidance.
