I would first review the applications of the remaining candidates to see if any of them have relevant experience or skills that could potentially meet the preferences of the committees. If there are no suitable candidates among the current applicants, I would reach out to the candidates individually to discuss their interests, skills, and potential fit for the committees to gauge their flexibility and willingness to adapt.

If after this discussion, it becomes clear that the current candidates are not the best fit for the committees, I would then consider reaching out to my friends to encourage them to apply for the positions. I would be transparent with the candidates about the situation and explain the rationale behind considering new applicants.

Ultimately, I would prioritize selecting the best candidates who can contribute effectively to the committees and represent the student body well, while also ensuring a fair and transparent selection process.
