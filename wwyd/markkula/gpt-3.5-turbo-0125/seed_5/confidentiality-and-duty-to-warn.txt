I would first express my concern about the thoughts he shared regarding stalking Susan and her boyfriend. I would explain that such behavior is not appropriate and can have serious legal and ethical consequences. I would explore his feelings of jealousy and rejection in a non-judgmental way, trying to understand the underlying emotions driving his desire to scare them. I would discuss healthy coping mechanisms for managing jealousy and rejection, such as talking about his feelings with a trusted friend or engaging in activities that bring him joy and fulfillment. Additionally, I would assess his risk of harm to himself or others and develop a safety plan if necessary. Finally, I would encourage him to consider seeking couples therapy to address any unresolved feelings he may have towards Susan and to work on building healthy relationships in the future.
