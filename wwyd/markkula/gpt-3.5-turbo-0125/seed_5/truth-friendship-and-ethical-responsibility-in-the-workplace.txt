I would advise Ben to prioritize honesty and integrity in this situation. He should disclose all the information he knows about Michael's fraudulent activities to the company's internal investigation team, as withholding information could potentially make him complicit in the fraud. Ben should provide a detailed account of what he knows about the fraudulent scheme, including any conversations or evidence that could help the company understand the extent of the wrongdoing.

Ben should also express his concerns about the potential repercussions for himself and seek guidance on how to proceed in a way that protects his own position within the company. It is important for Ben to remember that by disclosing the truth, he is helping to uphold the company's values and integrity, which is crucial for maintaining a trustworthy reputation in the business world.

While Ben may feel conflicted about potentially jeopardizing his friendship with Michael, he must prioritize his professional responsibilities and the well-being of the company over personal relationships. By being transparent and forthcoming with the information he has, Ben can demonstrate his commitment to ethical behavior and accountability in the workplace.
