I would address the situation by taking the following actions:

1. Conduct a thorough review of the informed consent process used in the clinical trial in Russia to ensure that it met all necessary standards. This includes assessing whether the consent form was provided in a language and format that the participants could understand, whether the risks and benefits were properly explained, and whether participants were truly able to make an informed decision to participate.

2. Establish a follow-up plan to ensure that participants in the clinical trial have access to continued medical care and support after the trial has ended. This could involve setting up a system for participants to contact healthcare providers for guidance and assistance, as well as exploring options for providing ongoing treatment for those who cannot afford it.

3. Consider the ethical implications of marketing and selling the new arthritis treatment primarily in the U.S., where it may be unaffordable for the participants from the clinical trial in Russia. Explore potential strategies to make the treatment more accessible to those who participated in the trial, such as offering discounted pricing or financial assistance programs.

4. Engage with relevant stakeholders, including healthcare providers, patient advocacy groups, and regulatory bodies, to discuss the ethical considerations and potential solutions for addressing the needs of the trial participants in Russia. Seek input and guidance on how to best support these individuals moving forward.

5. Conduct a retrospective analysis of the clinical trial data to assess the long-term impact of the treatment on the participants and evaluate any potential disparities in outcomes based on factors such as education level or access to medical care. Use this information to inform future decisions and practices regarding clinical trials in diverse populations.
