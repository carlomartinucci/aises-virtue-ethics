I would work to ensure that the voices and concerns of the Navajo tribe are included and prioritized in the negotiations and decision-making processes related to water allocation from the Colorado River. This would involve advocating for the Navajo Nation to be actively involved in discussions, consultations, and agreements regarding water resources. I would also push for measures to address the historical injustices and lack of access to clean water faced by the Navajo people, such as implementing safe and reliable water sources for all members of the tribe. Additionally, I would support initiatives that aim to uphold the treaties and obligations made to the Navajo Nation concerning water rights and ensure that their rights are respected and upheld in the context of the Colorado River crisis.
