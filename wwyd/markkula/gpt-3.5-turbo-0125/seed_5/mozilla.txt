In this scenario, I would work with the board and key stakeholders to conduct a thorough review of the situation surrounding Brendan Eich's resignation. This would involve gathering feedback from employees, contributors, and other relevant parties to understand their perspectives on the matter. I would also analyze any potential impact on the organization's reputation, values, and mission.

Based on the findings from the review, I would develop a clear communication strategy to address the concerns raised by employees and the public. This could involve reiterating the organization's commitment to diversity, inclusion, and supporting the LGBTQ+ community, as well as outlining any steps being taken to ensure alignment between personal values of leaders and the values of the company.

Additionally, I would work with the board to identify any gaps in the organization's policies or processes that may have contributed to this situation. This could include reviewing the company's code of conduct, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and leadership selection criteria to ensure that such controversies are minimized in the future.

Overall, my focus would be on addressing the immediate fallout from Brendan Eich's resignation, rebuilding trust within the organization and the community, and strengthening the organization's commitment to its mission and values moving forward.
