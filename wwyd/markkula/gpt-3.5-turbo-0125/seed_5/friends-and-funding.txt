If I were in Angela's position, I would recuse myself from the vote on the funding requests for campus organizations due to the conflict of interest presented by my close friendship with Emily, the president of the Hawaiian cultural club. By recusing myself, I would ensure that the decision-making process remains fair and unbiased, and that the other organizations have a fair chance at receiving the funding they need for their events. Additionally, by maintaining the integrity of the voting process, I would uphold the principles of transparency and fairness within the student government, even if it means potentially delaying the vote due to the lack of a quorum.
