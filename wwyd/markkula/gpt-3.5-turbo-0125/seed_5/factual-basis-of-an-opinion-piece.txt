I would recommend that Elena discuss the situation with Jack, clarifying the university's actual admissions process as revealed by her investigation. She should explain the importance of factual accuracy in journalism and express her concerns about publishing misleading information. Elena can offer Jack the opportunity to revise his piece with accurate information or provide him with the option to write about a different topic for the opinion section. By having an open and transparent conversation with Jack, Elena can uphold journalistic integrity while also respecting the value of diverse perspectives in opinion pieces.
