Given the scenario, I would recommend reaching out to the developers of PunkSpider, specifically Alejandro Carceres, to discuss potential solutions to mitigate the risks associated with publicly disclosing unpatched vulnerabilities. I would suggest implementing additional safeguards within the tool to prevent malicious actors from exploiting the vulnerabilities before website administrators have a chance to address them.

Specifically, I would propose enhancing the opt-out feature to make it more user-friendly and prominent for website administrators who do not wish to be included in PunkSpider's scans. This could help reduce the chances of exposing vulnerabilities to malicious actors. Additionally, I would recommend providing clear guidelines and resources for website administrators on how to address and patch vulnerabilities once they are identified by PunkSpider, thereby encouraging proactive security measures.

Furthermore, I would advise conducting a thorough risk assessment with input from cybersecurity experts to identify potential unintended consequences of publicly disclosing vulnerabilities and to explore alternative approaches that could achieve the same goal of improving website security without increasing the risk of exploitation.
