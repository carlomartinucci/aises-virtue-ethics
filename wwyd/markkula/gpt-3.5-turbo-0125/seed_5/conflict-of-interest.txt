If I were in Miguel's shoes, I would step down from my role in the outdoor club temporarily in order to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. This would allow me to focus on my responsibilities within the student government and ensure that I can maintain neutrality and integrity in the decision-making process regarding the club's petitioning for upper-level status. By taking a step back from the club for a year, I can demonstrate my commitment to upholding ethical standards and prioritizing the reputation of the student government organization. Additionally, this decision would provide me with the necessary distance to make impartial judgments and avoid any perceived bias in the evaluation process.
