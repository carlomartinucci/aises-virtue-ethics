In Josh's position, I would schedule a face-to-face meeting with Alanna to express my concerns about the lack of communication and collaboration for the upcoming fair. During the meeting, I would outline the importance of the event for the student body and the positive impact the collaboration between student government and RHA has had in the past. I would listen to Alanna's perspective on the situation and try to understand any challenges or reasons for her behavior.

I would then propose a clear plan of action with specific deadlines and responsibilities for both organizations to ensure that the event is successful. This plan should include tasks such as applying for permits, contacting vendors, and finalizing event details. I would emphasize the benefits of working together and the potential consequences of not collaborating effectively.

If Alanna continues to resist or show disinterest in the collaboration, I would involve both organizations' advisors to mediate the situation and help find a resolution. It is crucial to maintain open communication and transparency throughout the process to address any underlying issues and find a mutually beneficial solution for both student government and RHA.
