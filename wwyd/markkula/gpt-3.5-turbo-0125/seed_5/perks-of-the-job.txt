I would schedule a private meeting with Julia to express my concerns about her use of student government resources for personal homework. During the meeting, I would explain the importance of following the organization's policies regarding the use of office supplies and budget allocation. I would emphasize that while I appreciate her dedication and hard work for the organization, it is crucial to uphold the standards of ethical conduct and accountability. I would offer to help her find alternative solutions for completing her homework without using student government resources, such as guiding her to available campus resources or helping her manage her workload more efficiently. I would also suggest that we work together to find ways to reduce costs for office supplies and ink to better allocate the budget for student programs.
