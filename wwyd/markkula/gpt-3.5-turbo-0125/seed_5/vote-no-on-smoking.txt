In Talia's position, I would schedule a meeting with the university administration to discuss their concerns about the smoking ban. During the meeting, I would ask for more information about the specific legal and logistical issues that they are worried about. I would also inquire about any potential compromises or alternative solutions that could address their concerns while still moving towards a healthier campus environment. By having an open dialogue with the administration, I would aim to find a middle ground that satisfies both the university's worries and the students' desire for a smoking ban. This approach would demonstrate to both parties that I am willing to listen, negotiate, and find solutions that benefit the entire campus community.
