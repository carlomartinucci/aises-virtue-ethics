I would investigate the situation by reviewing the company's policies and procedures regarding employee conduct, termination, and reinstatement. I would also gather information on how ASD is accommodated in the workplace and whether the company has a history of accommodating employees with disabilities. 

Next, I would schedule a meeting with the relevant stakeholders, including HR, legal, and management, to discuss Matt's request for reinstatement. During the meeting, I would advocate for a fair and thorough review of the situation, taking into account Matt's ASD diagnosis, his past experiences with discrimination, and the circumstances surrounding the inappropriate comment.

I would recommend conducting an assessment to determine if accommodations can be provided to support Matt in his role and prevent similar incidents in the future. This may involve training on appropriate workplace behavior, sensitivity to individuals with disabilities, and creating a more inclusive work environment.

Ultimately, I would work towards a decision that balances the company's policies and values with the need to provide equal opportunities for all employees, including those with disabilities like ASD.
