I would immediately research and analyze the specific details and impact of the MiDAS system on the wrongly accused Michigan residents from 2013 to 2015. This would involve studying the errors made by the algorithm, understanding how it led to incorrect fraud accusations, and the extent of the penalties faced by the affected individuals, such as wage garnishments and seized tax refunds. 

Next, I would reach out to legal experts specializing in technology and algorithmic accountability to gain insights into the potential legal avenues available for the impacted residents to seek justice and compensation. This would involve understanding the current status of lawsuits against state officials and companies involved in the design and implementation of MiDAS, as well as assessing the feasibility of further legal action.

Additionally, I would collaborate with advocacy groups and organizations that focus on algorithmic fairness and social justice to raise awareness about the flaws in automated systems like MiDAS and the detrimental impact they can have on individuals' lives. This may involve organizing public campaigns, writing op-eds, and engaging with policymakers to push for greater transparency and accountability in the use of algorithmic systems in government programs.

Lastly, I would work on creating resources and support systems for the affected residents to navigate the complex processes of appealing decisions made by automated systems, accessing legal aid, and seeking financial restitution for the damages they have incurred. This could involve setting up helplines, hosting informational sessions, and connecting individuals with pro bono legal services to assist them in their pursuit of justice.
