In Marcus's position, I would hold individual meetings with each of the opposing candidates who expressed willingness to take other positions. During these meetings, I would have candid discussions to gauge their intentions, level of commitment, and willingness to collaborate constructively despite the election outcome. I would seek assurances that they are genuinely interested in contributing positively to the organization, irrespective of the election results. Based on these conversations, I would assess their compatibility with the organizational goals and team dynamics to determine the best fit for the executive cabinet.

Additionally, to ensure a fair and inclusive selection process, I would also interview some of Marcus's ardent campaign supporters who applied for positions. I would evaluate their passion, dedication, and alignment with the vision and values of the student government. By carefully considering both the opposing candidates and supporters, I would aim to build a diverse and balanced executive cabinet that represents various perspectives and strengths. Ultimately, my goal would be to create a cohesive team that can work collaboratively towards the betterment of the organization.
