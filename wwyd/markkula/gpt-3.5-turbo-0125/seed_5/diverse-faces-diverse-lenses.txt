I would conduct a thorough review of the process and criteria used by IBM Research to select and annotate the photos from the YFCC-100M Creative Commons data set for the Diversity in Faces (DiF) dataset. This review would involve examining the consent process for individuals whose photos were included in the dataset, as well as assessing the transparency in communication about the dataset's purpose and potential uses. Additionally, I would investigate the mechanisms in place for individuals to request the removal of their photos from the dataset and ensure that these processes are accessible and effective. Finally, I would analyze the impact of sharing the dataset with researchers and the potential consequences of not being able to remove photos from versions already shared.
