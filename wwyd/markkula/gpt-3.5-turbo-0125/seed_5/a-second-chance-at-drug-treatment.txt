I would schedule a meeting with Jerome to discuss his situation in more detail. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about his recent relapse and emphasize the importance of consistent attendance and adherence to the program for successful recovery. I would also inquire about his current living situation, support network, and willingness to fully commit to the program.

Furthermore, I would explore the possibility of connecting Jerome with additional resources, such as support groups, individual counseling, or alternative treatment options that may better suit his needs. I would also discuss the option of inpatient addiction treatment and provide information about the available facilities, despite the challenges with waiting lists and insurance coverage.

Ultimately, I would make a decision about allowing Jerome back into the program based on his level of commitment, willingness to engage in additional support services, and potential for success. I would take into consideration his personal circumstances, history of addiction, and the need for a comprehensive treatment approach.
