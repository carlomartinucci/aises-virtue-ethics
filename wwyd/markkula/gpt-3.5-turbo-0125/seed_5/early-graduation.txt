I would advise Grace to have a transparent conversation with the senior members of the student government about her situation. She should explain her plans to graduate early and the potential impact it may have on her ability to fulfill her year-long commitment if she were to run for the senior class senator position. Grace should seek their guidance on how best to proceed, whether it be finding alternative ways to stay involved in the organization or discussing the possibility of a temporary replacement for the spring quarter if she were to win the election. By being open and seeking advice from senior members, Grace can navigate this situation with integrity and consideration for the organization's needs.
