In this situation, as Karina, I would schedule a private meeting with key members from both the Senate and the Executive Cabinet to facilitate a constructive dialogue. During the meeting, I would encourage open communication and active listening from both sides to ensure that each party feels heard and understood.

I would start by acknowledging the valid concerns raised by both the Senate and the Executive Cabinet regarding the proposed changes to the attendance policy. I would then work towards finding common ground and potential compromises that could address the underlying issues raised by both parties.

Additionally, I would emphasize the importance of collaboration and unity within the student government organization. I would remind both the Senate and the Executive Cabinet members of the shared goal of serving the student body and working towards the betterment of the university community.

By fostering a respectful and productive discussion between the two branches, I would aim to bridge the gap in understanding and reach a consensus that benefits the organization as a whole.
