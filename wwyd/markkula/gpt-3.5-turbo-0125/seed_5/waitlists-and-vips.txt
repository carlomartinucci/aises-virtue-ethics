I would advise Callie to send a quick email to the senior class informing them of the ticket availability due to errors in data entry. In the email, she should clearly state that the tickets will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis to ensure fairness. This way, she can quickly allocate the remaining tickets without the need for a waiting list. Additionally, Callie should set a specific deadline for interested seniors to respond, ensuring that she can efficiently manage the ticket distribution process alongside her other event preparations.
