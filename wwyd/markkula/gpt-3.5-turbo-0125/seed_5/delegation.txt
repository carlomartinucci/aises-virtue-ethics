In Bryson's situation, I would schedule a meeting with each of my three student staff members individually to discuss their workload and stress levels. During these meetings, I would express my concerns about their well-being and inquire about how they are handling their responsibilities. I would encourage open communication and ask if they feel overwhelmed or if there are specific tasks they are struggling with. Based on their feedback, I would work with each staff member to prioritize their workload, potentially redistributing tasks or adjusting deadlines to alleviate some of the pressure.

Additionally, I would review my own responsibilities and identify key tasks that I must personally manage in order to fulfill the requirements of my position. I would reassess the division of duties between myself and my staff members, ensuring that I am not shirking essential responsibilities that only I can effectively handle. If necessary, I would make adjustments to my delegation strategy to strike a better balance between community relations work and state-level advocacy efforts.

Ultimately, my goal would be to support my staff members in managing their workload effectively, while also ensuring that I am fulfilling my own duties as the External Relations Vice President. Clear communication, collaboration, and a strategic approach to task delegation would be key in navigating this challenging situation.
