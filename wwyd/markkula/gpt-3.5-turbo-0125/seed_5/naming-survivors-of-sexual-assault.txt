I would assure Alexandra that her confidentiality will be respected in the article and that her name will be redacted to protect her identity. I would explain to her that her privacy and well-being are of utmost importance, and that I understand her concerns about potential backlash or public scrutiny. I would also offer her the option to review any quotes or information attributed to her before the article is published to ensure accuracy and to make any necessary changes to protect her anonymity. Additionally, I would provide her with resources for support and counseling, and offer to connect her with advocacy groups or services that could help her navigate her feelings and experiences.
