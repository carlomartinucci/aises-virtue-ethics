Given the scenario presented, I would take the following specific actions to address the issue of child labor in IKEA's supply chain:

1. Implement a comprehensive supplier auditing program: I would establish a rigorous auditing program to regularly inspect and monitor all supplier facilities, especially those in regions known for child labor practices. This would involve conducting thorough on-site inspections to ensure compliance with labor laws and ethical standards.

2. Provide training and education for suppliers: I would organize training sessions to educate suppliers on the importance of ethical labor practices, including the prohibition of child labor. This would help raise awareness and ensure that suppliers understand and adhere to IKEA's ethical standards.

3. Establish clear guidelines and expectations: I would work on developing clear guidelines and expectations for suppliers regarding labor practices, emphasizing zero tolerance for child labor. These guidelines would be communicated clearly to all suppliers and enforced rigorously.

4. Collaborate with local authorities and organizations: I would collaborate with local authorities and organizations in countries where IKEA has suppliers to address the issue of child labor effectively. This would involve working together to identify and rescue children working in hazardous conditions and provide them with access to education and support.

5. Engage in transparency and accountability: I would ensure transparency in IKEA's supply chain by regularly reporting on efforts to combat child labor and improve labor conditions. This would help build trust with customers and stakeholders and hold IKEA accountable for its commitments to ethical sourcing practices.

By taking these specific actions, IKEA can demonstrate its commitment to eradicating child labor from its supply chain and uphold its reputation as a responsible and ethical company.
