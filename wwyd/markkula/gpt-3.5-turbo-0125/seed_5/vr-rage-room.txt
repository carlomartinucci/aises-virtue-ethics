If I were in this scenario, I would ensure that the app's TOS are strictly enforced regarding the prohibition of scenarios involving directing VR violence at humans. This would involve monitoring user-generated content for any violations of this rule, promptly removing any offending content, and taking appropriate action against the users or creators responsible, such as banning them from the platform. Additionally, I would regularly review and update the TOS as needed to maintain a safe and ethical environment for all users.
