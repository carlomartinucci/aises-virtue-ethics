I would suggest that Claire implement a blind review process for funding requests within the student government committee. This would involve removing any identifying information about the submitting club, including names and logos, from the proposals before they are reviewed by the committee members. This way, the committee members, including Garret, would be evaluating proposals solely on their merit and alignment with funding criteria, without being influenced by personal affiliations or biases. This approach would help ensure fairness and equal treatment for all clubs seeking funding, while also maintaining the integrity of the process and respecting Garret's contributions to the student government.
