I would first ensure that Julia is in a safe environment by making sure the potentially harmful medication is out of her reach. I would then establish trust and rapport with her by actively listening to her concerns and validating her feelings. I would respect her autonomy as an adult and emphasize the importance of her well-being.

I would explore alternative treatment options with Julia that may be more tolerable for her, such as therapy or lifestyle changes. I would also discuss the importance of having a support system and encourage her to consider involving trusted individuals in her treatment plan, even if it's not her parents.

Given the school psychologist's concerns about possible suicidal ideation, I would conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment to determine the level of risk and develop a safety plan with Julia. I would also discuss the option of contacting emergency services or involving her parents if the risk is deemed high.

Throughout the conversation, I would make sure to communicate openly and non-judgmentally with Julia, emphasizing that my primary goal is to help her feel better and ensure her safety.
