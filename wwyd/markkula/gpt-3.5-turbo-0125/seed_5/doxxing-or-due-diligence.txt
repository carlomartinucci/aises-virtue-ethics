I would advise Andres to publish the article with the student's name redacted. This action aligns with the principle of protecting vulnerable sources, as the student expressed concerns about potential social ostracization and backlash. The student voluntarily engaged in public discourse by posting his views on social media, but his current vulnerability due to the online backlash necessitates protection. By respecting his wish for anonymity, the newspaper upholds ethical standards of safeguarding sources, especially in situations where individuals may face harm for expressing their opinions.
