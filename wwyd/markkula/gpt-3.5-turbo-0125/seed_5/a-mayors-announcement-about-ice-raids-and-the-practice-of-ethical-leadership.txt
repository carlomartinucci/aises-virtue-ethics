If I were in this scenario, I would acknowledge the complexities and criticisms surrounding Mayor Schaaf's decision to announce the ICE raids. To address the situation, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Conduct a thorough review of the information Mayor Schaaf received about the ICE raids through unofficial government channels to verify its accuracy and assess any potential impact on law enforcement operations.
  
2. Initiate a dialogue with relevant stakeholders, including law enforcement officials, immigrant advocacy groups, and community leaders, to discuss the implications of Mayor Schaaf's announcement and develop strategies to address any concerns or fallout from the raids.

3. Collaborate with legal experts to clarify the legal obligations and limitations of sanctuary city status, ensuring that actions taken align with the law and ethical standards.

4. Seek clarification on the discrepancies in the number of immigrants with criminal records provided by ICE officials and former spokesman James Schwab, and work towards ensuring accurate information is communicated to the public.

5. Engage in transparent communication with the public about the decision-making process behind Mayor Schaaf's announcement, addressing concerns raised by critics and emphasizing accountability and ethical conduct in public service.
