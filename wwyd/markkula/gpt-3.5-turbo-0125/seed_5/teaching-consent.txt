I would conduct research to understand the specific challenges that neurodiverse individuals face in identifying and expressing consent in social situations. I would then collaborate with experts in neurodiversity and sexual assault prevention to develop new resources that provide clear, unambiguous guidelines on what consent looks like for neurodiverse individuals. These resources would include concrete examples and scenarios that are universally applicable and easily understood by neurodiverse students. I would also work with the university's sexual assault prevention center to ensure that these revised materials are implemented and distributed effectively to support neurodiverse students in understanding and practicing consent.
