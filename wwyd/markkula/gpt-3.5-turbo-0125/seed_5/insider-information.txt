I would suggest that Drake schedule a brief meeting with Alex to provide general advice on how to improve the funding proposal without giving specific details that would guarantee its approval. During the meeting, Drake can offer guidance on common mistakes to avoid, general strategies for making the proposal stronger, and resources available for further assistance. This way, Drake can help Alex without crossing the line of providing unfair advantage to his friend's club over others.
