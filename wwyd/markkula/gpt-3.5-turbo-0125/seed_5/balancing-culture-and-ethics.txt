I would advise Ben to express his gratitude for the warm welcome and hospitality extended to him by the villagers and JP. He could acknowledge the positive impact the business development has had on the village in terms of providing additional income for families. However, Ben should also diplomatically express his concerns about the involvement of children in the laborious tasks at such a young age. He could mention his observations about the potential risks to the children's well-being, especially in terms of their eyesight and overall health. Ben could suggest exploring alternative ways to support the families economically without having children engage in such risky labor practices. He should emphasize the importance of prioritizing the well-being and education of the children in the community.
