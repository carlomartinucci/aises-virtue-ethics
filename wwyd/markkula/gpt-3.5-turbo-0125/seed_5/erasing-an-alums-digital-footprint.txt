I would advise Analyssa to redact Marcus' name from the article. This decision would prioritize Marcus' current livelihood and well-being over a mistake made in his youth. It would also demonstrate the school paper's understanding of the evolving landscape of technology and its impact on individuals' reputations. By showing compassion and empathy towards Marcus, the school paper can help him move forward and be judged on his present character and abilities by potential employers.
