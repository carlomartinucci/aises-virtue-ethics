As Maria, I would first conduct a survey of the student body to understand their preferences and tolerance levels regarding the number of emails they receive. This can provide valuable insights into how students perceive the current email communication strategy and help in making informed decisions.

Next, I would schedule a meeting with the student government and faculty representatives to discuss the situation openly and transparently. During the meeting, I would emphasize the importance of maintaining a balance between student organization events and essential information from faculty members. I would propose the idea of creating a separate email list specifically for faculty members to share important information with students, in addition to their inclusion in the weekly email newsletter.

To address the concerns about overwhelming students with emails, I would work with the IT department to implement an email preference center where students can choose their email frequency and select the types of information they wish to receive. This way, students have more control over the emails they receive, reducing the risk of mass unsubscriptions.

In the long term, I would establish clear guidelines and policies for email communication to ensure fairness and transparency in accessing the student email lists. This can help prevent similar issues from arising in the future and promote effective communication between student organizations and faculty members.
