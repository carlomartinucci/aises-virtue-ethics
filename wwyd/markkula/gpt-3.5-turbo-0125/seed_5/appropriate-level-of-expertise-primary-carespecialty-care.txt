I would have a candid and empathetic conversation with Peter about the importance of seeking a specialist's evaluation for his symptoms. I would explain to him that while I value his trust in me as his primary care physician, it is crucial for his well-being to receive a thorough assessment from a psychiatrist who is specialized in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions such as bipolar disorder. I would reassure Peter that seeing a psychiatrist does not diminish our relationship, but rather complements the care he receives from me. I would emphasize that my primary concern is his overall health and ensuring he receives the most appropriate treatment. Additionally, I would offer to assist Peter in finding a psychiatrist who he may feel comfortable with and provide ongoing support throughout the process.
