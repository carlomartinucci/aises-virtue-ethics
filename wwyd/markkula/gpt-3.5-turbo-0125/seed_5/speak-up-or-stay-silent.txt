Tre should schedule a private meeting with his direct supervisor or manager to discuss his concerns about the discrepancy in sales reporting. During the meeting, Tre should present the specific examples he found where sales of basic products were inaccurately recorded as sales of advanced products. Tre should express his belief that this misrepresentation may mislead investors and the board of directors. Tre should also inquire about the reasons behind this practice and seek clarification on whether there is a legitimate explanation for the discrepancy.

In the meeting, Tre should emphasize his commitment to integrity and ethical business practices, highlighting that he wants to ensure the company's reporting is accurate and transparent. Tre should also communicate his willingness to work with his supervisor and the team to address the issue and correct the reporting practices going forward.

Additionally, Tre should express his concerns about the potential consequences of this misreporting on the company's reputation and financial performance. Tre should make it clear that his intention is not to create problems but to uphold ethical standards and contribute to the company's success in a responsible manner.

Tre should document the meeting and any follow-up actions agreed upon with his supervisor to ensure accountability and track progress towards resolving the issue. If Tre faces any pushback or retaliation for raising his concerns, he should consider seeking guidance from the company's HR department or an external ethics hotline for support and protection.
