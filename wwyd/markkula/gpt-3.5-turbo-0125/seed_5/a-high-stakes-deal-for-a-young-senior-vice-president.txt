Tim should firmly refuse to sign the altered agreement and reject the envelope of cash from Sam. He should explain to Sam that he cannot compromise his integrity and ethical principles for personal gain, regardless of the financial pressures he is facing. Tim should emphasize the importance of conducting the deal transparently and ethically, ensuring compliance with all regulatory requirements without any fraudulent behavior.

Additionally, Tim should document the attempted bribery incident and report it to his company's internal compliance or legal department. He should seek guidance and support from his superiors or the appropriate authorities to address the situation and protect both himself and the integrity of the deal. Tim should also consider seeking advice from a trusted mentor or professional counselor to manage the stress and emotional burden of the situation while maintaining his commitment to ethical conduct.
