I would collaborate with the developers of image generation tools to incorporate a feature that calculates and displays the estimated energy and water consumption for each image generated. This feature would provide users with real-time feedback on the environmental impact of their activities, raising awareness and encouraging more conscious usage of the AI tools. Additionally, I would work on implementing an optional setting that allows users to choose a more energy-efficient mode for generating images, promoting sustainability without compromising the user experience.
