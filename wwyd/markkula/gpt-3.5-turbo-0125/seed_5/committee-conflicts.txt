I would suggest that Tyler prioritize connecting with his constituents by setting aside dedicated time each week to meet with students, listen to their concerns, and seek feedback on their experiences at the university. He could schedule open office hours, host town hall meetings, or attend student organization events to engage with a diverse group of students and understand their needs better.

Additionally, Tyler could consider delegating some of his committee responsibilities to other members if possible, to free up time for community engagement without completely sacrificing his committee work. By communicating his desire to better represent his constituents to his fellow Senators and seeking their support in balancing his commitments, Tyler may find a way to maintain his effectiveness in both areas.

It would also be beneficial for Tyler to communicate openly with his constituents about his decision to prioritize connecting with them, explaining his motivations and seeking their input on the issues most important to them. By demonstrating his commitment to serving their interests, Tyler can build trust and credibility as a representative, even if it means adjusting his approach to Senate responsibilities.
