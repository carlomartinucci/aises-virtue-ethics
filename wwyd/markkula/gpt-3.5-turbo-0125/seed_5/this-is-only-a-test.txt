As a response to the concerns raised about bias in face detection with proctoring software, I would conduct a thorough review of the software's algorithm and data to identify any potential sources of bias. This would involve working closely with the development team and the ethical tech consulting firm to analyze the software's performance across different demographic groups and ensure that it is not unfairly targeting or disadvantaging certain students based on their race, gender, or other characteristics. Additionally, I would prioritize implementing changes to the software that minimize the risk of bias and ensure fair treatment for all students using the platform.
