I would advise Nadia to disclose her involvement in the student organization and her connections to the protest participants in her article. By being transparent about her affiliations, she can maintain her credibility as a fair and objective reporter. She should also make an effort to seek out diverse perspectives on the issue, including perspectives that may differ from those of the protest participants, to ensure a balanced and nuanced portrayal of the situation. Additionally, I would recommend that Nadia discuss her concerns with her editor, Christian, to ensure that they are both on the same page regarding her approach to the story.
