One specific action Carlos could take is to explore alternative funding sources for the retreat. He could reach out to local businesses or alumni for sponsorships or donations to help cover the increased cost of the retreat. Carlos could also consider organizing a fundraiser specifically for the retreat expenses to ensure that the student government budget remains intact for programs that benefit the student body. Additionally, he could look into potential grants or scholarships that may be available to support student leadership development activities like the retreat. By actively seeking out additional funding sources, Carlos can work towards preserving the retreat experience for student government members without compromising other important programs for the student body.
