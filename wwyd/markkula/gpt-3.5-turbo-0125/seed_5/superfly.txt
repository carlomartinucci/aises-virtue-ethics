I would review the terms and conditions of SuperFly to ensure that all the information provided to customers is accurate and transparent. This includes verifying that the cost breakdown, services offered, and any additional fees are clearly stated upfront. If there are any hidden costs or misleading information, I would work with the team to update the terms and conditions to ensure full disclosure to customers. This is important to build trust with customers and maintain ethical business practices.
