I would have a private conversation with the patient to discuss the legal implications of her drug use during pregnancy. I would explain the mandatory reporting requirements in our state and the potential consequences of not complying with these laws. I would also emphasize that my priority is the health and well-being of both her and her baby.

I would offer her support and resources to help her in her journey towards becoming drug-free, including information about available treatment programs and counseling services. I would work with her to develop a personalized care plan that takes into account her specific needs and challenges.

I would also make sure to involve other healthcare professionals, such as addiction specialists and social workers, to provide comprehensive care for the patient. Together, we would monitor her progress closely and provide ongoing support to help her achieve her goal of being a good mother to her baby.

I would document all discussions and interventions in her medical record to ensure continuity of care and to comply with legal requirements.
