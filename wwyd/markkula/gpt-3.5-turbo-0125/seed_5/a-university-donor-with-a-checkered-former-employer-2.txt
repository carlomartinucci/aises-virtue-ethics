I would thank the donor for their generosity and express appreciation for their willingness to support the university's mission. I would then acknowledge the donor's background with the financial group that had past controversies, but also note that the donor was not associated with those issues. I would assure the donor that their contribution would go towards supporting the university's initiatives in diversifying STEM and helping underrepresented students succeed in their academic pursuits.

I would also inform the donor that the university takes ethical considerations seriously and that all donations are used to advance the university's mission in a transparent and responsible manner. I would offer to provide more information about how their donation would directly impact the programs and initiatives aimed at supporting underrepresented students in STEM fields.

Lastly, I would express gratitude for the donor's commitment to giving back to the community and their interest in supporting the university's efforts to create a more inclusive and diverse environment in STEM education.
