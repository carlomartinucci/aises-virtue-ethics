I would schedule a meeting with the President and Vice President to express my gratitude for the offer to be Director of Marketing. During the meeting, I would honestly communicate my passion for the three positions I originally applied for - Director of Leadership Development, Community Service, and Women's Affairs. I would explain how those areas align more closely with my interests and goals for personal growth within the student government organization. I would respectfully express my concerns about not feeling as connected to the marketing position and my desire to explore other areas that could provide me with greater opportunities for development.

I would also mention my friend who was very keen on the marketing position and how I don't want to disappoint her. I would propose the idea of potentially shadowing the Director of Marketing to better understand the role and responsibilities, while also discussing the possibility of transitioning into a different position that aligns more with my interests in the future. By having an open and honest conversation, I would aim to find a solution that benefits both the organization and myself, while also considering the feelings of my friend and the potential impact on my future aspirations within the student government.
