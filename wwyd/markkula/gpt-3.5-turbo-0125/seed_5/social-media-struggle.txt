Matt should privately reach out to John and express his concerns about the video. He should explain that while he values their friendship and respects John as a leader, he believes that the video compromises the professionalism and integrity of the student government organization. Matt should encourage John to consider removing the video from his social media accounts to avoid any potential negative consequences for both of them and the organization. Matt should also offer his support and assistance to help John navigate the situation and make better choices in the future.
