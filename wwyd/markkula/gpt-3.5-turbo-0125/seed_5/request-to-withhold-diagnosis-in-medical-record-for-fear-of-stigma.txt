I would first express empathy and understanding towards Sophie for her struggles with depression and the impact it is having on her. I would then explain to her the importance of transparency in medical records, especially when it comes to mental health issues, as it is crucial for providing her with the best care possible and for ensuring her safety and well-being. 

I would recommend a comprehensive treatment plan that includes both medication and therapy, as she has expressed willingness to engage in therapy for the first time. I would explain the benefits of combining both approaches for managing depression and the importance of addressing underlying issues through therapy. I would also provide her with recommendations for therapists and encourage her to seek help openly and without fear of stigma.

I would have an open and honest conversation with Sophie about the implications of not disclosing her mental health history in her medical records, especially in relation to future licensure applications. I would encourage her to prioritize her health and well-being over concerns about potential repercussions, and advise her on the potential consequences of not disclosing this information to licensing boards.

Ultimately, I would prioritize Sophie's health and well-being, while also emphasizing the importance of honesty and transparency in her medical records for her own long-term benefit and safety.
