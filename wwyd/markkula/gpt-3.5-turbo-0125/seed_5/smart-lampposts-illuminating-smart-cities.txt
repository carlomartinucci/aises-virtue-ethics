I would first gather more information on the specific capabilities of the smart lampposts in Hong Kong, including which surveillance features have been disabled as promised by the government. I would review any official statements or documents released by the government regarding the technology used in the lampposts.

Next, I would assess the current situation in Hong Kong regarding the destruction of the smart lampposts during the protests. I would seek to understand the concerns and fears of the protesters regarding privacy and surveillance, and I would also look into any actions taken by the government to address these concerns.

I would communicate with local authorities and the company that decided to end its contract with the government to gather their perspectives on the situation. Understanding the reasons behind the threats received by the company's employees and executives would be crucial in determining the broader impact of the protests on stakeholders involved in the smart lamppost project.

Based on this information, I would evaluate the potential risks and benefits of the smart lamppost program in Hong Kong. I would consider whether the government's efforts to disable certain surveillance features are sufficient to address privacy concerns and if there are any additional measures that could be implemented to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of smart technology in public spaces.
