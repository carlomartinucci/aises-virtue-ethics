I would first gather all relevant information about the accusations against the donor's family and the ongoing investigation. I would consult with legal counsel to understand the potential implications for the museum if we were to accept the donation. 

Next, I would discuss the situation with the museum's leadership team to get their input and perspectives on the matter. We would collectively weigh the ethical considerations of accepting the donation given the allegations against the donor's family, and how it aligns with the museum's values and mission.

If we decide to move forward with accepting the donation, I would draft a formal agreement outlining the terms of the donation, including transparency about the donor's identity and any potential controversies surrounding their family. This agreement would also clearly stipulate that the donation is to be used solely for the purposes of funding the specified staff positions and social media efforts.

Throughout this process, I would maintain open communication with the donor, expressing appreciation for their generosity while also addressing the sensitive nature of the situation and our commitment to ethical fundraising practices.
