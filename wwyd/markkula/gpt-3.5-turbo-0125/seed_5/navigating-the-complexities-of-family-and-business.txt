As the CFO of the family business, Mary should first analyze the financial implications of the different options available. She should prepare a detailed financial projection comparing the potential outcomes of selling the building versus keeping and managing it with hired help. This analysis should include estimates of potential income from renting out the building, costs of hiring external management, potential future appreciation of the building, and tax implications of selling it.

After conducting this analysis, Mary should communicate the findings to all the shareholders, emphasizing the potential risks and benefits of each option. She should highlight the long-term financial implications for each shareholder and the impact on the family legacy.

Mary should also suggest exploring alternative solutions that could satisfy both Donald's desire to exit the business and the long-term sustainability of the family business. For example, she could propose negotiating a fair buyout price for Donald that reflects the current market value of his shares while ensuring the financial stability of the remaining shareholders.

In terms of ethical considerations, Mary should prioritize transparency, fairness, and mutual respect in her decision-making process. She should ensure that all shareholders are informed and involved in the decision-making process, and that their interests are taken into account. Mary should also consider the long-term impact of her decisions on the family relationships and the legacy of the business. It is essential for her to navigate the situation with integrity and empathy, balancing financial considerations with family dynamics.
