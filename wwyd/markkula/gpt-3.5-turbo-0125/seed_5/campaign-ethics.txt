In Olivia's position, I would first take a step back and reflect on my actions and intentions. I would consider the potential ethical implications of using my current role to benefit my upcoming campaign for ASI president. I would then seek advice from a trusted mentor or colleague within the university to get an outside perspective on the situation. Additionally, I would consider disclosing my intentions to my team in the Community Relations Branch and seek their input and feedback on the initiatives I am planning.

If after reflecting and seeking advice, I still feel uncomfortable about the situation, I would consider adjusting my approach. This could involve being transparent about my intentions to run for ASI president and seeking approval from a higher authority within the university for the initiatives I plan to implement. I would also explore ways to ensure that the initiatives benefit the student body first and foremost, rather than solely serving as campaign material.

Ultimately, my goal would be to navigate this situation with integrity and transparency, ensuring that my actions align with ethical standards and serve the best interests of the university and its students.
