I would advise Derek to first try to find a middle ground between voicing student concerns authentically and meeting the administration's expectations. He could consider framing the issues in a way that aligns with the departmental goals and learning objectives while still staying true to the students' needs. Derek could also schedule a meeting with the Vice Provost to discuss the importance of addressing the off-campus Greek life thefts, emphasizing the impact it has on a significant portion of the student body.

Additionally, Derek could involve other student government leaders who have similar concerns about compromising student initiatives to strategize on how to approach the administration more effectively. By building a coalition within the student government, Derek may be able to present a unified front and advocate for student issues more convincingly.

If despite his efforts, the Vice Provost continues to refuse to discuss the Greek life thefts, Derek could explore alternative channels for addressing the issue, such as organizing a town hall meeting or reaching out to local law enforcement for support. It's important for Derek to prioritize the well-being and interests of the student body while also maintaining a constructive relationship with the administration.
