I would advise James to limit his campaign spending in order to level the playing field and promote fairness in the election. Specifically, I would recommend that James refrain from renting the black Mercedes Benz sports cars to drive students to classes on Election Day. This action would help reduce the disparity in resources between him and Alix, allowing for a more equitable competition based on merits and ideas rather than financial advantage. Additionally, James could consider reallocating some of his campaign funds to support initiatives that would benefit the student body as a whole, demonstrating his commitment to serving the interests of the student community.
