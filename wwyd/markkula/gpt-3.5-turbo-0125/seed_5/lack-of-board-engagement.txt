I would schedule individual meetings with each board member to discuss the organization's goals, challenges, and opportunities for growth. During these meetings, I would seek to understand each board member's perspective, concerns, and level of commitment to the organization. I would also clearly communicate my vision for the nonprofit and the importance of active board participation in achieving our goals. Additionally, I would provide specific examples of how each board member can contribute, whether through fundraising, community outreach, or strategic planning. Finally, I would work with the board chair to develop a plan for improving board engagement and setting expectations for attendance and participation in board activities.
