I would schedule a meeting with Fatimah to discuss her concerns and gather more information about her reservations regarding the campus safety reports being tweeted from the paper's account. During the meeting, I would listen to her perspective and ask her to elaborate on why she feels conflicted about the newsworthiness of these reports. I would also inquire about her thoughts on the potential impact of sharing these reports on social media, both in terms of readership engagement and ethical considerations.

Based on our conversation, I would work collaboratively with Fatimah to analyze the situation further and weigh the potential benefits of increased readership against the ethical implications of sharing potentially sensitive information in a public forum. Together, we could explore alternative ways to engage students online while maintaining journalistic integrity and ethical standards.

Ultimately, I would support Fatimah in making an informed decision about whether or not to continue tweeting campus safety reports from the paper's account, ensuring that she feels empowered to uphold her values as a journalist while also considering the interests of the paper and its readers.
