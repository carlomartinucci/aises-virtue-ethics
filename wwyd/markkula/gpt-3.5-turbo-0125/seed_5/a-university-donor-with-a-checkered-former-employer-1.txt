I would thank the donor for their generosity and express appreciation for their willingness to support the university's mission. I would then acknowledge the donor's background with the financial group that was involved in predatory lending practices during the 2008 recession. I would express the university's commitment to ethical fundraising practices and ensuring that all donations align with the university's values, especially in promoting diversity in STEM fields.

I would inform the donor that the university takes donor ethics seriously and has a due diligence process in place to evaluate potential donors to ensure their values align with the university's mission. I would kindly request more information from the donor about their specific role and involvement with the financial group during the controversial period to better understand their individual stance on the matter.

Based on the donor's response and further investigation, I would consult with university leadership and the fundraising team to make an informed decision on whether to accept the donation. If the donor's involvement with the financial group during the controversy does not align with the university's values and mission to promote diversity and ethical practices in STEM education, I would respectfully decline the donation while expressing gratitude for the donor's interest in supporting the university.
