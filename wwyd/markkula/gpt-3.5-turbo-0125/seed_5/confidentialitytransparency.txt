If I were Akira, I would calmly explain to the upset senator the importance of maintaining confidentiality in sensitive disciplinary matters to protect the privacy and dignity of all involved parties. I would acknowledge his concerns about transparency and assure him that the executive board will provide a summary of the decision reached after the meeting, in adherence to transparency principles. However, I would firmly request that he respect the need for confidentiality in this specific situation and ask him to leave the room to allow the executive board to discuss the matter privately.
