I would advise Dave to immediately stop the arrangement with Alex. Dave should also report the illegal activities of the non-profit managers to the appropriate authorities within his organization and the local government in the Dominican Republic. He should provide all relevant information and evidence to ensure that the managers are held accountable for their actions. Additionally, Dave should work with his organization to establish proper procedures for currency exchange that comply with local laws and regulations to prevent such unethical behavior in the future.
