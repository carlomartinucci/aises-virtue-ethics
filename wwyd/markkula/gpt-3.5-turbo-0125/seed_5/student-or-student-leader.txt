I would first meet with the two affected senators individually to discuss the situation and understand their perspectives. I would inquire if there are any alternative solutions they have considered, and if they have explored options such as switching classes or seeking permission from the instructors to miss certain classes for Senate meetings. 

Next, I would review the official attendance policy and the organization's bylaws to determine if there is any room for flexibility or exceptions in cases of extenuating circumstances. If there is no provision for exceptions, I would propose to the Senate the possibility of amending the attendance policy to allow for additional absences in cases where a senator's academic requirements conflict with their Senate responsibilities. 

I would also work with the senators to explore alternative ways for them to stay engaged and contribute to the organization despite their inability to attend meetings in person. This could include assigning them specific tasks or responsibilities outside of meetings, such as conducting research, preparing reports, or communicating with constituents virtually.

Ultimately, I would strive to find a solution that balances the senators' academic commitments with their responsibilities to the student government, while also upholding the integrity of the organization's attendance policy.
