As a response to this scenario, I would recommend conducting a thorough internal investigation within the company to assess the impact of the released emails on Snapchat's reputation and public image. This investigation should involve gathering feedback from key stakeholders, including employees, investors, and users. Based on the findings, I would suggest developing a clear and transparent communication strategy to address the situation. This strategy should include issuing a public statement reaffirming the company's commitment to ethical behavior and outlining steps taken to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future. Additionally, I would propose implementing sensitivity training and diversity programs within the organization to promote a more inclusive and respectful workplace culture.
