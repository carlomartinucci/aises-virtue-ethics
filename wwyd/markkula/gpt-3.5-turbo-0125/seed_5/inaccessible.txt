I would immediately address the situation by advocating for Michelle's rights and ensuring that appropriate accommodations are provided. I would discuss the issue with the physician in charge, emphasizing the importance of providing accessible care for all patients, including those with disabilities. I would also request additional staff support to assist Michelle onto the exam table for a thorough physical examination. Additionally, I would recommend that the physician receive additional training on treating patients with mobility disabilities to prevent similar incidents in the future. Finally, I would work with the clinic management to review and improve accessibility protocols to ensure that all patients receive proper care regardless of their physical abilities.
