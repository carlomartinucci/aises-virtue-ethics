I would advise Jessica to prioritize Adam's safety and well-being above concerns about promoting trust or avoiding accusations of political bias. I would suggest that Jessica explain to Adam the potential risks of having his name included in the article, such as the possibility of being reported to ICE. I would recommend that Jessica offer to use a pseudonym or a generic description of Adam's background in the article to protect his identity while still sharing his story. Additionally, I would encourage Jessica to assure Adam of her commitment to accurately representing his experiences and perspectives in the article, even if his name is not explicitly used.
