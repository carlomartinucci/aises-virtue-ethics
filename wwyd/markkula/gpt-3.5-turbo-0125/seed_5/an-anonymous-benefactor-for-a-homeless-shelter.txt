I would thank the donor for her generosity and express gratitude for her desire to support our organization's mission. I would assure her that her wish for anonymity will be strictly respected. I would listen to her intentions for the gift and ask any clarifying questions to ensure that we understand her wishes clearly.

Given the donor's sensitive situation, I would consult with my supervisor or a more experienced colleague to discuss the ethical implications of accepting the donation. I would gather all necessary information about the donor and the source of the gift to make an informed decision.

If after consultation, it is determined that accepting the donation aligns with the organization's values and mission, I would work with the donor to facilitate the gift in a way that maintains her anonymity. This may involve coordinating with our finance team to ensure proper processing and acknowledgment of the donation without disclosing the donor's identity.

Throughout the process, I would uphold the donor's confidentiality and handle the situation with sensitivity and professionalism, while also ensuring transparency within the organization about the situation to maintain accountability.
