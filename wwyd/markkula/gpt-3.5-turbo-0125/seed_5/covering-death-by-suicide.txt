I would advise Hana to proceed with covering the story of the student's death while keeping in mind the various considerations and ethical implications involved. She could focus on highlighting the positive aspects of the student's life and achievements, emphasizing his involvement in campus activities and his impact on the community. 

To minimize the risk of harm, Hana should avoid including graphic details of the death and instead focus on promoting awareness of mental health issues and available resources on campus. She should also include helpline information and resources for those struggling with mental health concerns in the article.

Hana should ensure that the article is respectful and sensitive to the mourning family and the student's memory, avoiding sensationalism and morbid curiosity. By framing the story in a way that promotes a constructive dialogue about mental health and encourages healthy coping mechanisms, Hana can help raise awareness and reduce stigma surrounding mental health issues on campus.
