I would schedule a one-on-one meeting with Jamie to discuss his recent behavior and absences from meetings. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about the impact his actions are having on the student government and the initiatives being implemented by his branch. I would listen to Jamie's perspective on the situation, including any challenges he may be facing with his classes and other responsibilities at the university.

I would work with Jamie to come up with a plan to address his absences and improve his communication with the executive council. This plan could include setting specific goals for attendance and communication, as well as identifying any support or resources that Jamie may need to fulfill his responsibilities effectively.

While it is important to hold Jamie accountable for his commitment to the student government, I would also take into consideration the challenges he is facing and show understanding and support as needed. I would emphasize the importance of open communication and collaboration within the executive council to ensure the success of the student government as a whole.
