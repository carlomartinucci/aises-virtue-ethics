I would start by considering the specific needs and rights of Spencer, as well as the potential impact on the students and staff in the program. I would schedule a meeting with Spencer to discuss his request in more detail and to better understand how his emotional support dog helps him. During this meeting, I would also discuss potential accommodations that could be made to meet his needs while minimizing any potential negative impact on others.

After gathering this information, I would also consult with human resources and legal counsel to ensure that any accommodations made for Spencer comply with California state laws regarding emotional support animals in the workplace. I would carefully review the organization's policies and guidelines to determine the best course of action that is both legally compliant and ethically sound.

Based on the information gathered and the legal guidance received, I would make a decision on whether to hire Spencer and provide the necessary accommodations for his emotional support dog. If the accommodations are reasonable and feasible without causing undue hardship to the organization, I would move forward with hiring Spencer and ensuring that he has what he needs to be successful in his role.

Throughout this process, I would prioritize open communication with all stakeholders involved, including upper management, staff, and students, to ensure that everyone's needs and concerns are taken into consideration and addressed appropriately. It is important to balance the needs of individuals like Spencer with the overall well-being and experience of the entire program community.
