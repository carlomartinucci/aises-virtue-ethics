I would first review the privacy policies and legal agreements in place regarding the use of the video recordings from the smart light posts. I would also consult with legal experts to ensure that sharing the footage with the technology company for emotion-recognition AI complies with all relevant laws and regulations, especially concerning data protection and privacy. If necessary, I would work with city leaders to establish a clear data-sharing agreement that includes strict guidelines on how the footage can be used, stored, and protected to safeguard the privacy of individuals.
