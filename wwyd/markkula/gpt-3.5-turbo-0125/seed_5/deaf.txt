I would first apologize to Ali for not being able to address all of his health concerns in the limited time available during the appointment. I would express regret that his shortness of breath was not thoroughly examined and that it led to a serious health issue later on. I would then schedule an urgent follow-up appointment with Ali to specifically address his cardiac concerns and ensure proper evaluation and treatment. Additionally, I would review the clinic's appointment scheduling policy to see if accommodations can be made for patients who may need extra time due to communication barriers or sensitive health issues.
