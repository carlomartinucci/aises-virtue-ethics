I would thank the donor for her generous offer and express gratitude for her desire to support the shelter and the families in need. I would assure her that her wish for anonymity will be respected and that her name will not be associated with the gift in any way. I would explain that the shelter is in great need of funding to expand its capacity and improve services for families experiencing homelessness, and that her contribution would have a significant impact on the organization's ability to serve more families in need.

I would then discuss the logistics of the donation with her, including the process for transferring the funds and any specific preferences she may have for how the donation is used. I would also assure her that the organization will handle the donation with the utmost care and transparency, ensuring that the funds are used effectively and in line with the organization's mission to support families experiencing homelessness.

Finally, I would follow up with the donor after the donation has been made to express gratitude once again and provide an update on how her contribution has made a difference in the lives of the families served by the shelter.
