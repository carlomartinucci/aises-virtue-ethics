I would advise James to reconsider his campaign strategy and make adjustments to level the playing field with Alix. Instead of renting several black Mercedes Benz sports cars to drive students to classes on Election Day, which may give him an unfair advantage due to the flashy nature of the cars, James could opt for a more modest transportation option such as regular shuttles or buses. This would still allow him to provide a service to students without the extravagant display associated with luxury cars. Additionally, James could allocate some of his campaign funds to support Alix's marketing efforts to help balance out the disparity in resources between them. By taking these actions, James can demonstrate fairness and sportsmanship in the election process while still running an effective campaign.
