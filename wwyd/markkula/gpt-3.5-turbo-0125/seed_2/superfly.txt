I would first ensure that all the information presented to customers about SuperFly is accurate and transparent. This includes clearly communicating the limitations of a virtual reality vacation compared to a traditional one, such as the lack of physical experiences, interactions, and authentic cultural immersion.

Additionally, I would verify that all pricing details and fees associated with customizing the vacation packages are prominently displayed for customers to see before signing up. This includes providing a breakdown of costs for each additional customization option available.

Furthermore, I would conduct regular quality checks on the VR experiences offered by SuperFly to ensure they meet the promised standards of quality, safety, and customer satisfaction. This includes addressing any technical issues, glitches, or inaccuracies in the virtual destinations provided to customers.

Lastly, I would establish a clear process for handling customer complaints or dissatisfaction with their virtual vacation experience. This involves having a responsive customer service team in place to address any concerns promptly and offer suitable solutions or refunds if necessary.
