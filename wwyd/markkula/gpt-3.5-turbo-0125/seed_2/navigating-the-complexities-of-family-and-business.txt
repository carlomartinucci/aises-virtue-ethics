I would first suggest that Mary explore all possible options for the family business before making any decisions. This could include looking into alternative sources of revenue for the building, such as finding new tenants or repurposing the space for a different use. 

Additionally, I would recommend that Mary have a candid and open discussion with her brother, Donald, to understand his motivations for wanting to sell the building. It may be helpful for them to work together to find a compromise that takes into account both financial considerations and family dynamics.

If a vote on the future of the building is inevitable, I would advise Mary to carefully consider the potential impact on her relationships with her family members. It may be beneficial for her to seek the advice of a neutral third party, such as a mediator or family counselor, to help facilitate discussions and find a resolution that is acceptable to all parties involved.

Ultimately, Mary should prioritize open communication, empathy, and collaboration in navigating this challenging situation with her family. It is important for her to consider the long-term implications of her decisions on both the business and her relationships with her family members.
