I would schedule a private meeting with Julia to discuss the issue. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about the misuse of office resources and how it is affecting the organization's budget. I would emphasize the importance of adhering to the rules and regulations set by the student government regarding the use of office supplies. I would also offer support and assistance in finding alternative solutions for completing her homework without using the organization's resources. Finally, I would remind her of the impact her actions could have on the organization and the importance of setting a good example for other members.
