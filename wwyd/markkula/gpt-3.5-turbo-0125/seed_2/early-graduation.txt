I would advise Grace to be transparent with the senior members of the student government about her situation and intentions to graduate a quarter early. She should explain her passion for the organization and her desire to run for the senior class senator position, but also express her concerns about potentially leaving her seat empty in the spring. Grace should propose possible solutions to mitigate the impact of her early graduation, such as finding a temporary replacement for the spring quarter or working with the transition team to ensure a smooth handover of responsibilities. By being open and proactive about her plans, Grace can work collaboratively with her colleagues to find a solution that benefits both her and the organization.
