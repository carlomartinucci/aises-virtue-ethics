I would schedule a dedicated appointment with the patient to discuss his concerns about contracting syphilis. During the appointment, I would calmly and empathetically explore his beliefs and fears surrounding the issue. I would explain to him that despite his conviction, his test results do not indicate any presence of syphilis or other STDs. I would also inquire about his sexual history and any recent encounters to gain a better understanding of his current mental state.

Furthermore, I would collaborate with a medical doctor to conduct a thorough physical examination to rule out any medical conditions that could be contributing to his symptoms or beliefs. I would emphasize the importance of accurate information and reassure him that we are working together to address his health concerns.

Finally, I would adjust my treatment approach to address his escalating anxiety and mistrust. This may involve a combination of psychoeducation, cognitive-behavioral techniques, and possibly medication adjustments to help him manage his symptoms effectively. It is crucial to build a trusting therapeutic relationship to ensure he continues to engage in treatment and receives the support he needs.
