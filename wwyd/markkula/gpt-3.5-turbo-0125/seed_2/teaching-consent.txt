I would reach out to the sexual assault prevention center at the university to schedule a meeting with the staff members involved in creating the resources on consent. During the meeting, I would bring up the issue of the vague and potentially misleading descriptions of consent that could be inaccessible to neurodiverse individuals. I would suggest collaborating with experts in neurodiversity or disability advocacy to review and revise the materials to make them more clear, specific, and inclusive. Additionally, I would propose conducting training sessions or workshops specifically tailored to educate both neurodiverse and neurotypical students on how to navigate consent in social situations effectively.
