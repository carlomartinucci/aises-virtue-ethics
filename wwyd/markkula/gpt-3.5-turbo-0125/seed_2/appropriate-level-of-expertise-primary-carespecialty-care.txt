I would continue to emphasize the importance of seeing a psychiatrist for a comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan for suspected bipolar disorder. I would explain to Peter that while I value his trust in me, my expertise is limited in this area and seeing a specialist would provide him with the best possible care. I would offer to help him find a psychiatrist he feels comfortable with and accompany him to the appointment if needed. If Peter continues to refuse, I would document our conversations and my recommendations in his medical record to ensure continuity of care and make sure he is informed about the potential risks of not seeking specialized psychiatric care.
