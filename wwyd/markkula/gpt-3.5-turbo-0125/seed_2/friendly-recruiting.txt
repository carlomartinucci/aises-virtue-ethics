In this situation, I would first review the applications of the remaining candidates to see if any of them possess relevant skills or experiences that could potentially make them suitable for the specific committees in question. If I find that none of the remaining candidates are a good match, I would then reach out to my friends who I believe would be ideal fits for the committees and encourage them to apply.

To ensure fairness and transparency, I would clearly communicate to the applicants my decision-making process and the criteria I am using to select committee representatives. I would also inform the remaining candidates that I am considering additional applicants to find the best fit for the committees.

After receiving applications from my friends, I would evaluate them based on the same criteria used for the initial batch of applicants. If my friends indeed prove to be the best candidates for the committees, I would then appoint them to the positions, while expressing my appreciation to the other candidates for their interest and effort in applying.

Overall, my goal would be to prioritize the quality and effectiveness of the student representatives on the committees while maintaining transparency and fairness throughout the selection process.
