I would advise Angela to disclose her conflict of interest regarding her friendship with Emily, the president of the Hawaiian cultural club, to the rest of the student senate before the vote. Angela should explain the situation honestly and transparently to ensure that all senators are aware of her personal connection to one of the requesting organizations. Following this disclosure, Angela should ask for guidance from the senate on how they would like her to proceed - whether they believe she should recuse herself from the vote or not. By being open about her conflict of interest and seeking input from her peers, Angela can uphold transparency and fairness in the decision-making process.
