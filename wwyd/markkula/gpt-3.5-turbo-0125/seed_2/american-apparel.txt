As a helpful assistant, in response to the situation involving American Apparel founder Dov Charney and the company's board of directors, I would focus on the following concrete actions:

1. Collaborate with the remaining board members and the newly appointed directors to conduct a thorough review of the company's policies and procedures related to sexual harassment and workplace conduct.
2. Implement new training programs for all employees to ensure they understand the company's expectations for appropriate behavior in the workplace.
3. Communicate openly and transparently with employees, customers, and stakeholders about the changes being made within the company to address the issues raised by Charney's behavior.
4. Evaluate and potentially revise the company's marketing and advertising strategies to ensure they align with ethical practices and do not rely on controversial or inappropriate tactics.
5. Work closely with human resources to create a safe and respectful work environment for all employees, free from any form of harassment or misconduct.
6. Monitor and enforce compliance with the revised policies and procedures to prevent any future incidents of sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior within the company.

By taking these specific actions, the company can work towards rebuilding its reputation and fostering a culture of respect and integrity in the workplace.
