I would immediately address the situation by initiating a comprehensive review of the clinical trial that was conducted in Russia by the pharmaceutical company Rx. This review would include:

1. Conducting a thorough evaluation of the informed consent process used during the trial to ensure that participants were adequately informed of the risks, benefits, and alternatives related to their participation in the trial.
   
2. Assessing the educational background of the participants enrolled in the trial to determine if they had the necessary understanding to provide valid informed consent. If it is found that many participants lacked the appropriate knowledge, steps would be taken to rectify this issue.

3. Investigating the circumstances that led to the majority of participants enrolling in the trial for the purpose of accessing free medical care. This would involve ensuring that participants were not coerced or incentivized to participate in the trial solely for the provision of medical services.

4. Reviewing the post-trial care plan for participants to ensure that they have appropriate access to continued treatment following the conclusion of the trial, particularly in light of the potential financial barriers they may face in accessing the newly approved drug.

5. Developing a plan to address the potential ethical concerns raised by the trial, including any necessary actions to remediate harm caused by inadequate informed consent or lack of access to continued care for participants.

6. Implementing changes to the company's clinical trial protocols and practices to prevent similar ethical issues from arising in future trials, including enhanced participant education and support mechanisms.

Overall, the goal of this review would be to uphold the ethical standards of clinical research and ensure that participants are treated with respect, dignity, and fairness throughout the trial process and beyond.
