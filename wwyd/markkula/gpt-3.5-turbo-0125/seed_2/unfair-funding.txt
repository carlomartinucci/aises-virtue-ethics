In this scenario, I would recommend that Claire takes the following specific actions:

1. Conduct a thorough review of the funding allocation process to identify any systemic biases or issues that may be leading to certain clubs receiving disproportionate funding compared to others.
  
2. Implement a new policy where all funding requests, including those from Garret's club, go through an additional review process by an independent panel or committee to ensure fairness and transparency in the decision-making process.

3. Organize a training session for all committee members, including Garret, to educate them on the importance of impartiality and avoiding conflicts of interest when reviewing funding requests.

4. Consider implementing a rotation system where committee members, including Garret, are periodically reassigned to different committees to prevent any single individual from consistently reviewing proposals from their own club.

5. Encourage open discussions within the student government committee about the potential for bias or perceptions of favoritism and work together to find solutions that promote equity and fairness in the distribution of funds.

By taking these specific actions, Claire can address the concerns of potential bias in the funding allocation process while also maintaining a positive working relationship with Garret and the other committee members.
