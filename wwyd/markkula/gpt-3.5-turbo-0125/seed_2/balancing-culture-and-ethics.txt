Ben should express his concern about the child labor practices he observed at the looms in the village. He should emphasize the importance of prioritizing the well-being and safety of children, highlighting the potential risks to their health and development posed by engaging in such work at a young age. Ben should acknowledge the economic challenges faced by the families in the village but stress the need to find alternative solutions that do not involve exploiting children for labor. Additionally, he should offer his support in exploring sustainable and ethical ways to improve the livelihoods of the villagers without compromising the rights of the children.
