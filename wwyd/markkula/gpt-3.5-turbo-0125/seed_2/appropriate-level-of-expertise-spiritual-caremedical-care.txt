I would express my concern for John's well-being and emphasize the importance of seeking professional help. I would offer to assist him in finding a counselor or therapist who specializes in depression and substance abuse issues. I would also encourage him to consider attending a support group meeting, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, to connect with others who may be going through similar challenges. Additionally, I would continue to pray with him and provide emotional support while emphasizing the importance of seeking professional help for his mental health and addiction concerns.
