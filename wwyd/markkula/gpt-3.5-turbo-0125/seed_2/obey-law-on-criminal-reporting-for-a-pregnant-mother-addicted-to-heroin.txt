I would first explain to the patient the legal requirements and potential consequences of reporting her drug use during pregnancy, including the possibility of criminal charges and involvement of child protective services. I would emphasize the importance of seeking treatment for her heroin addiction to protect both her own health and that of the fetus.

Next, I would discuss with the patient the available options for treatment, including the inpatient drug treatment program that provides medically-supported heroin withdrawal for both her and the fetus. I would also explore other support services and resources that could help her during and after pregnancy.

I would work with the patient to develop a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses her addiction, prenatal care, and ongoing support for parenting. I would ensure that she has access to regular prenatal check-ups, counseling, and addiction treatment services to increase her chances of successfully overcoming her addiction and ensuring the well-being of her baby.

Throughout the process, I would provide non-judgmental support and encouragement to the patient, emphasizing that her commitment to her baby's well-being is commendable and that she has the potential to be a good mother with the right support in place.
