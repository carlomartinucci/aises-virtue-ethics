I would first review the company's policies and procedures regarding rehiring former employees who were terminated for policy violations. I would then schedule a meeting with relevant stakeholders, including HR, legal, and management, to discuss Matt's request for reinstatement in light of his ASD disclosure. During the meeting, I would gather all relevant information, including any documentation provided by Matt regarding his diagnosis and any additional information to consider his request. I would then work with the team to assess the situation, taking into account any legal obligations and the company's commitment to diversity and inclusion. If appropriate, I would facilitate a meeting between Matt and company representatives to discuss his request and explore potential options for moving forward.
