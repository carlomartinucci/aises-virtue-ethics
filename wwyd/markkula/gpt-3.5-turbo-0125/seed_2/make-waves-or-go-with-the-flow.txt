I would advise Claire to have a private conversation with her manager, Fred, to express her concerns about the unrealistic hours budgeted for the audit of Company Z. During this conversation, Claire should provide specific examples of the additional work required and the reasons why the current budgeted hours are insufficient. She should also inquire about any potential solutions or adjustments that can be made to ensure the audit is completed thoroughly and accurately within a reasonable timeframe. Additionally, Claire should seek clarification from Fred regarding the allocation of hours to training activities, especially if these are being done outside of regular working hours, to ensure compliance with the firm's policies and guidelines.
