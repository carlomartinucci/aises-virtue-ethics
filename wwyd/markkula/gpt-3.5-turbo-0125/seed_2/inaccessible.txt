I would immediately address the situation by advocating for Michelle's needs within the clinic. I would inform the physician about the specific accessibility issues that are hindering Michelle's ability to receive proper care, emphasizing the importance of accommodating patients with disabilities. I would also seek out additional staff members or resources to assist Michelle in transferring onto the exam table for the physical examination. Furthermore, I would request additional training for the physician in treating patients with mobility disabilities to prevent similar oversights in the future. Finally, I would ensure that Michelle receives the necessary medical attention and follow-up care for her stage three decubitus ulcer, coordinating with the healthcare team to provide comprehensive treatment and support.
