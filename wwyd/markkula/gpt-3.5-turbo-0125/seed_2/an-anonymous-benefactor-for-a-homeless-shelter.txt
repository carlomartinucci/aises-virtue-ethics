I would thank the donor for her generosity and express gratitude for considering our organization to make such a significant contribution. I would let her know that her desire for anonymity will be respected and assure her that her identity will never be disclosed in any form of recognition or communication related to the gift.

I would also inform her that we have a strict confidentiality policy and that her personal information, including her name and the nature of our conversation, will be kept completely confidential within the organization. I would then proceed to discuss the logistics of the gift, including any specific preferences she may have regarding the allocation of funds and the timeline for the donation.

After finalizing the details of the gift, I would work with our finance and legal teams to ensure that all necessary paperwork and documentation are in order to accept the donation securely and in compliance with all regulations. I would also make sure to keep the donor updated on the progress of the project funded by her gift and provide her with regular reports on the impact of her contribution on the families and staff at the shelter.
