If I were Maria, I would convene a meeting with all relevant stakeholders, including representatives from student organizations, faculty members, staff members, and student government leadership. During the meeting, I would facilitate an open discussion to understand the perspectives and concerns of all parties involved. I would emphasize the importance of balancing the needs of students with the desire of faculty members to communicate valuable information.

After hearing from all stakeholders, I would propose a solution that involves creating a separate email list specifically for faculty and staff members to share essential information with students. This new list would have clear guidelines on the type and frequency of emails allowed to maintain a manageable volume. I would work with IT services to set up the new email list and ensure that faculty and staff members are trained on how to use it effectively.

In addition, I would continue to manage the student events email list to ensure that student organizations have the opportunity to promote their events while also including relevant information from faculty members in the weekly newsletter. I would communicate the changes to all stakeholders and seek feedback to continuously improve the communication process.

By addressing the concerns of both student organizations and faculty members through open communication and practical solutions, I believe I can strike a balance that benefits the entire student community.
