In Talia's position, I would schedule a meeting with the sophomore students to discuss the smoking ban initiative. I would present the concerns raised by the university administration regarding student rights and potential lawsuits. I would facilitate a dialogue to gather more insights and perspectives from the students on both sides of the issue. This will allow for a more informed decision-making process that takes into account the concerns of the university administration as well as the desires of the students. Additionally, I would seek input from legal experts or advisors to better understand the potential legal implications of the ban. Ultimately, I would vote based on the collective input gathered from the students and legal advice received, aiming to strike a balance between promoting a healthy campus environment and respecting student rights.
