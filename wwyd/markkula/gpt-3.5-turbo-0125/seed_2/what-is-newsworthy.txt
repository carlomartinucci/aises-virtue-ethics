I would suggest that Fatimah meet with the editorial team to discuss the ethical considerations of tweeting campus safety reports. During the meeting, she can bring up her concerns about the newsworthiness of these reports and the potential impact on the students involved. The team can evaluate whether sharing these reports aligns with the newspaper's values and journalistic standards. They can also explore alternative ways to engage students online without compromising the integrity of the paper. Ultimately, the decision should be made collaboratively with input from the entire team.
