I would assure Alexandra that her name will be redacted from the article to protect her privacy and safety. I would explain to her that I understand her concerns and respect her decision to remain anonymous. I would also offer her the option to review any quotes or information attributed to her in the article before publication to ensure accuracy and comfort.

In the article, I would focus on the broader implications of the federal guidelines while using anonymized examples to illustrate the potential impact on survivors of sexual assault. I would highlight the perspectives of advocacy groups and experts to provide a comprehensive analysis of the issue.

To address concerns about perpetuating taboos, I would include a section discussing the challenges faced by survivors in coming forward and emphasize the importance of supporting and believing survivors of sexual assault. I would strive to strike a balance between respecting survivors' privacy and sharing their stories in a way that raises awareness and promotes understanding.
