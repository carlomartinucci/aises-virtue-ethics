I would schedule a private meeting with Jaime to express my concerns about his recent behavior and absenteeism. During the meeting, I would acknowledge the challenges he has faced with his classes and other commitments, but also emphasize the importance of his role in the student government and the impact his actions are having on the team's effectiveness. I would work with Jaime to establish a plan to address his time management issues and ensure that he can fulfill his responsibilities effectively moving forward. Additionally, I would offer support and resources to help him manage his workload and prioritize his commitments. It is important to find a balance between holding Jaime accountable for his actions and showing understanding and support during a challenging time for him.
