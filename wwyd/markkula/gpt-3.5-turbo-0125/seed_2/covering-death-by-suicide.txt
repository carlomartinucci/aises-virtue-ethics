I would advise Hana to cover the story of her classmate's death in a sensitive and responsible manner. She should focus on celebrating his life and contributions to the campus community while also highlighting the importance of mental health awareness and resources. Hana should avoid sensationalizing the death and instead, emphasize the need for open conversations about mental health and support for those struggling with similar issues. She should include information about helplines and resources for anyone in need of support. Hana should also consult with mental health professionals or organizations for guidance on how to approach the topic in a way that minimizes the risk of harm and promotes positive dialogue around mental health.
