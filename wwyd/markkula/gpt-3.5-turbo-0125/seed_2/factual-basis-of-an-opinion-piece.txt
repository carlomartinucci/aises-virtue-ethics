I would advise Elena to fact-check the article thoroughly to ensure its accuracy. Since the university does not practice affirmative action in its admission process, Elena should inform Jack of this fact and ask him to revise his piece accordingly. If Jack refuses to make the necessary changes to accurately reflect the university's policies, Elena should not publish the article. Elena can explain to Jack that while the paper values diverse perspectives and freedom of speech, it also upholds the importance of presenting factual information to its readers. Elena can suggest that Jack revise his piece to focus on a different argument or topic that aligns with the facts. By doing so, Elena can maintain the paper's commitment to accuracy while also respecting Jack's freedom of expression.
