In Josh's position, I would schedule a meeting with Alanna to have a frank and open conversation about the concerns and challenges facing the collaboration for the upcoming fair. During the meeting, I would express my appreciation for the past successful collaborations between student government and RHA, and acknowledge the importance of their partnership in creating memorable events for the student body. I would then address the current issues head-on, highlighting the need for timely planning and coordination to ensure the success of this year's fair.

I would listen to Alanna's perspective and try to understand the reasons behind her lukewarm response and sporadic communication. I would express my concerns about the impact of further delays on the event's quality and emphasize the need for both organizations to work together efficiently to address the pending tasks. I would propose a concrete plan of action, outlining specific steps and timelines for collaboration, such as scheduling regular check-in meetings, delegating responsibilities, and setting clear deadlines for tasks.

I would also offer my assistance and support to Alanna and RHA in any way possible to alleviate their workload and facilitate smoother communication and planning. By demonstrating understanding, empathy, and a proactive approach to problem-solving, I aim to reestablish trust and cooperation between student government and RHA, ensuring the successful execution of the fair while preserving the valuable partnership between the two organizations for future events.
