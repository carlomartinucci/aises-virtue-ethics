In Karina's position, I would schedule separate meetings with the Executive Cabinet and the Senate to facilitate open and respectful communication. During these meetings, I would encourage each side to explain their perspectives in a calm and constructive manner. I would actively listen to their concerns, ask clarifying questions, and help them see the value in the other side's viewpoint. I would work towards finding common ground and potential compromises that could address the concerns raised by both the Executive Cabinet and the Senate regarding the attendance policy. Additionally, I would emphasize the importance of collaboration and unity within the student government organization to achieve its mission effectively.
