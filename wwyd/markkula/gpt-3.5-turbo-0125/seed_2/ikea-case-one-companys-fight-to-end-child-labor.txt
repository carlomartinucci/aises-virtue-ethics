In response to the accusations of child labor in its supply chain, specifically in the rug industry in countries like India and Nepal, here are some specific actions that I would take as part of IKEA's management team:

1. Develop a comprehensive supplier code of conduct specifically addressing child labor, setting clear expectations and consequences for violations.
2. Implement regular and unannounced audits at supplier facilities to monitor and ensure compliance with the code of conduct.
3. Establish a dedicated team within the supply chain management department to focus on monitoring and addressing labor practices, including child labor, in supplier factories.
4. Provide training and awareness programs for IKEA buyers and employees on identifying and reporting any signs of child labor during supplier visits.
5. Collaborate with local NGOs and labor rights organizations in countries where IKEA has suppliers to gather information, support remediation efforts, and ensure transparency in addressing child labor issues.
6. Engage with government authorities in countries where child labor is prevalent to advocate for stronger enforcement of labor laws and regulations.
7. Develop a system for remediation and support for affected children found in supplier factories, including access to education and healthcare services.
8. Communicate openly and transparently with stakeholders, including customers and the public, about the actions taken to address child labor in the supply chain and the progress made in improving working conditions.

By taking these specific actions, IKEA can demonstrate a commitment to ethical sourcing practices and work towards eliminating child labor from its supply chain.
