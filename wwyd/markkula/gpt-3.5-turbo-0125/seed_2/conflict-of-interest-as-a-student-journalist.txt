I would advise Nadia to disclose her involvement with the student organization dedicated to social activism and service learning in her article about the protest. This transparency would help maintain her credibility as a journalist and show her commitment to ethical reporting practices. Additionally, I would suggest that Nadia take extra care to verify information, gather diverse perspectives, and remain impartial in her reporting to ensure fair and accurate coverage of the protest and the working conditions of the custodial staff.
