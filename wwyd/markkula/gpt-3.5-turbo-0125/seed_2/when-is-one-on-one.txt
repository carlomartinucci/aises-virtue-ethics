I would schedule a meeting with Kyle's parents and the administrators of Eminent Scholars to discuss their concerns about the limitations in social interaction and available resources at the school. During the meeting, I would inquire about the school's strategies for fostering social skills and peer interaction among students in a one-to-one learning environment. I would also ask for specific examples of how they have successfully supported students like Kyle in developing teamwork and communication skills despite the reduced opportunities for collaboration.

Additionally, I would suggest arranging a visit for Kyle and his parents to Eminent Scholars so they can observe firsthand how the school operates and interact with current students and teachers. This visit would provide Kyle's parents with a better understanding of the school's atmosphere and the support systems in place for students with similar needs.

Furthermore, I would offer to connect Kyle's parents with other families whose children attend Eminent Scholars, particularly those with students who have similar challenges and have benefited from the personalized education approach. Hearing directly from other parents about their experiences and the progress their children have made at the school could help alleviate some of Kyle's parents' concerns.

Overall, my goal would be to gather specific information, provide opportunities for firsthand experience, and facilitate connections with other families to address Kyle's parents' concerns and help them make an informed decision about Kyle's educational path.
