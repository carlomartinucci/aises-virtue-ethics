I would suggest that Analyssa redact Marcus' name from the article while providing a brief explanation in an editor's note at the end of the article. The note could explain the reasons for the redaction, emphasizing the importance of privacy in the digital age and the potential negative impact on Marcus's future job prospects. This would maintain transparency regarding the alteration made to the original content while also showing empathy towards Marcus's situation and the evolving nature of online information.
