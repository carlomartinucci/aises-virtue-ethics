Given the scenario, I would first acknowledge the importance of protecting the safety and well-being of all residents, including vulnerable populations. I would consider alternative ways to inform the immigrant community about potential ICE raids, such as utilizing community outreach programs or working with local immigrant advocacy organizations to disseminate information in a discreet and effective manner. Additionally, I would prioritize collaboration with federal agencies to ensure that lawful processes are followed while upholding the sanctuary city status of Oakland. I would also advocate for transparency and accuracy in communication, especially when it comes to sensitive issues like immigration enforcement.
