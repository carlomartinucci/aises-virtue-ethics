I would ensure that the app's parent company, GoldCat, regularly monitors and reviews the user-uploaded content to ensure compliance with the terms of service prohibiting scenarios involving violence against humans. This would involve implementing a thorough review process, potentially using a combination of automated tools and manual moderation to check each uploaded scenario for any violations. If any content is found to breach the terms, immediate action should be taken to remove it from the platform and suspend or ban the user responsible. Regular communication and reminders about the terms of service should also be sent to users and creators to emphasize the importance of adhering to the guidelines.
