I would first ensure Julia's immediate safety by confiscating the bottle of powerful pain medication from her and ensuring it is properly disposed of. Next, I would have a private conversation with Julia to establish a rapport and express my genuine concern for her well-being. I would emphasize the importance of addressing her mental health issues and the potential risks of not seeking appropriate treatment. I would then try to understand her concerns and fears about treatment causing worse symptoms and work with her to explore alternative treatment options that she may be more comfortable with, such as therapy or counseling. I would also discuss the possibility of involving her parents or other trusted individuals in her support network to provide additional support. Finally, I would schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor her progress and ensure she is receiving the necessary care and support.
