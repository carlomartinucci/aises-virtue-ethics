Matt should privately reach out to John and express his concerns about the video. He should explain that he feels John's actions are unprofessional and could reflect poorly on the student government organization. Matt should encourage John to remove the video from social media and have a discussion about the importance of upholding a positive image as student leaders. Matt should also offer his support to John in making better decisions in the future.
