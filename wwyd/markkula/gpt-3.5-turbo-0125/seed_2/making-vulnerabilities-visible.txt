I would reach out to the developers of PunkSpider to understand more about their intentions and the safeguards they have put in place to prevent malicious actors from exploiting the vulnerabilities. I would inquire about the specific measures they have taken to ensure that the tool is used responsibly and ethically. Additionally, I would ask about the processes they have in place for website administrators to easily opt out of being scanned by PunkSpider if they choose to do so. By gathering more information directly from the developers, I can better assess the potential risks and benefits of the tool and determine if any further actions are necessary to address ethical concerns.
