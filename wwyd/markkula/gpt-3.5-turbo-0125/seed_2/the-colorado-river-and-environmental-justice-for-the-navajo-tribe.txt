In this scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Reach out to relevant stakeholders and policymakers to advocate for the inclusion of the Navajo Nation in the negotiations and decision-making processes regarding water allocation from the Colorado River. This could involve contacting state legislators, federal representatives, and other key decision-makers to emphasize the importance of addressing the water rights of the Navajo tribe.

2. Collaborate with organizations that focus on Indigenous rights and environmental justice to amplify the voices of the Navajo Nation in the discussions surrounding water allocation. By working together with advocacy groups, we can increase awareness of the Navajo tribe's water access issues and push for their rights to be recognized in the decision-making process.

3. Support initiatives that aim to improve water infrastructure and access for the Navajo Nation, such as funding projects for clean water sources, upgrading existing infrastructure, and providing technical assistance for sustainable water management practices. By investing in these initiatives, we can help address the systemic injustices that have contributed to the lack of water access for the Navajo people.

By taking these concrete actions, we can work towards ensuring that the Navajo Nation's water rights are upheld and that their voices are heard in the negotiations over water allocation from the Colorado River.
