I would thank the donor for reaching out and expressing interest in supporting our university's campaign. I would express gratitude for their willingness to give back to the community and support our efforts to diversify STEM fields. 

I would then inform the donor that while we appreciate their generosity, as a university committed to ethical practices and social responsibility, we must carefully consider the values and reputation of our institution. I would explain that due to the past controversies associated with the financial group they were affiliated with, we have a responsibility to ensure that our donors align with our commitment to serving diverse and underrepresented communities in STEM.

I would kindly express our concerns about potential reputational risks and ethical considerations in accepting donations from individuals associated with organizations that have engaged in predatory practices. I would suggest that we may need to conduct further due diligence and have a discussion with university leadership before proceeding with accepting the donation.

I would then offer to follow up with the donor after discussing the situation internally to provide them with a clear decision on whether we can accept their donation. I would assure the donor that we value their support and will handle the situation with transparency and integrity.
