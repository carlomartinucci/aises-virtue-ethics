I would first review the entire situation by carefully reading the Politico article, the responses from Crisis Text Line, and the personal blog post from danah boyd. I would then reach out to the volunteers who raised concerns about the data-sharing agreement both internally and externally to gather their perspectives and feedback on the decision to end the agreement. I would also organize a meeting with the volunteers to discuss their concerns, address any remaining questions or uncertainties, and ensure that their voices are heard in the decision-making process moving forward.

I would then conduct a thorough review of Crisis Text Line's policies and practices related to data sharing and privacy to identify any gaps or areas for improvement. This review would include an assessment of how user consent is obtained and documented, as well as an evaluation of the organization's data governance framework to ensure that data is handled ethically and in line with best practices.

Based on the information gathered from my review and discussions with volunteers, I would work with the leadership team at Crisis Text Line to develop a clear and transparent policy on data sharing that prioritizes user privacy and consent. This policy would outline the organization's commitment to protecting user data, ensuring that any data shared with third parties is done so in a way that is fully disclosed and in line with user expectations.

I would also recommend implementing regular training sessions for volunteers on data privacy and ethics to ensure that they are aware of how user data is handled and shared, and to provide them with the knowledge and tools to raise concerns or questions about data practices within the organization.

Finally, I would suggest establishing a formal mechanism for ongoing feedback and communication between volunteers, leadership, and other stakeholders to ensure that concerns and feedback are addressed in a timely and transparent manner, and to foster a culture of openness and accountability within the organization.
