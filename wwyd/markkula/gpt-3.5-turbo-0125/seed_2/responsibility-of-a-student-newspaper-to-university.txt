I would advise Aidan and the editorial staff to have a meeting to discuss the situation and come to a consensus on how to proceed. They should consider the importance of journalistic integrity and the ethical responsibility to report the news accurately and transparently. They could also explore alternative options such as adding a clarification or response from the dean of engineering to provide a balanced perspective in the article. Additionally, they should reach out to journalism faculty or advisors for guidance on how to navigate this ethical dilemma while upholding their principles of independence and accountability.
