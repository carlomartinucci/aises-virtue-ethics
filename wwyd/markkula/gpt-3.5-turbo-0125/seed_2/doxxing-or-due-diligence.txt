Given the situation, I would respect the student's request for anonymity and not disclose his name in the article by Andres. I would also advise Andres to focus the article on the broader issue of campus discourse and differing viewpoints rather than singling out the student. This approach would uphold journalistic ethics by protecting the vulnerable source from potential harm while still addressing the underlying controversy surrounding the bulletin board and the differing perspectives on campus.
