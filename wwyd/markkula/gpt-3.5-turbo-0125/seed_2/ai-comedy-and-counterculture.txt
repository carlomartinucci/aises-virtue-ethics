I would reach out to the George Carlin estate and Carlin's daughter to offer a sincere apology on behalf of the company for using Carlin's likeness without permission. I would express regret for any distress caused by the AI-generated content and assure them that the company will take immediate steps to prevent such incidents in the future. Additionally, I would offer to engage in discussions with them to understand their concerns better and to find ways to support the protection of artists' rights in the age of AI technologies.
