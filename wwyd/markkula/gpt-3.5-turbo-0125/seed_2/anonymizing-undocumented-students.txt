I would advise Jessica to respect Adam's request for anonymity in the article. I would suggest that she explain to Adam the importance of maintaining his confidentiality for his safety and well-being. I would recommend that Jessica explore alternative ways to corroborate Adam's story without revealing his identity, such as seeking out other sources who can provide similar testimonies or statistics. Additionally, I would encourage Jessica to provide context in the article about the reasons for using an anonymous source in this specific case, emphasizing the importance of protecting vulnerable individuals while still upholding journalistic integrity.
