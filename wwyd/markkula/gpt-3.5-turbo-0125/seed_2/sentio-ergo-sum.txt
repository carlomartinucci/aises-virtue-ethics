I would first gather more information about the software, including how it operates, what data it collects, and how the notifications are presented to the call-center agents. I would review the terms and conditions and privacy policy to understand what information is disclosed to customers regarding the monitoring and analysis of their calls.

Next, I would assess the ethical implications of the software's use, considering factors such as transparency, consent, and potential impact on privacy and autonomy. I would consult with relevant stakeholders, including legal and compliance teams, to determine if the current practices comply with regulations and ethical standards.

If it is found that the software's current practices may be ethically questionable, I would recommend implementing changes to improve transparency and ensure that customers are fully informed about the extent of monitoring and analysis taking place during their calls. This may involve updating consent forms, providing clear disclosures to customers about the software's capabilities, and giving them the option to opt out of certain features.

I would also suggest conducting regular reviews of the software's use and impact to ensure that it aligns with ethical standards and does not compromise customer trust or privacy. Additionally, I would recommend providing training and support for call-center agents to help them understand the software's purpose and use it effectively while maintaining empathy and ethical conduct in their interactions.
