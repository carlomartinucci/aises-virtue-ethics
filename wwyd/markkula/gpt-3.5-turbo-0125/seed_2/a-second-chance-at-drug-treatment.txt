I would schedule a meeting with Jerome to discuss his current situation and treatment options. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about his recent relapse and emphasize the importance of consistent attendance and commitment to the program for successful recovery. I would also inquire about his current living situation, support network, and readiness for change.

Given Jerome's history and the severity of his addiction, I would recommend a thorough assessment to determine if inpatient treatment would be more suitable for his needs. I would provide him with information about the inpatient facility with the longer waiting list and discuss the potential benefits of more intensive, round-the-clock care.

Additionally, I would explore alternative options for support and treatment, such as connecting Jerome with community resources, support groups, and counseling services to enhance his chances of success. I would also offer to facilitate communication with his insurance provider to explore coverage options for inpatient treatment.

Ultimately, I would make a collaborative decision with Jerome about his treatment plan, taking into account his individual circumstances, needs, and motivations for recovery. I would convey empathy, support, and encouragement while also maintaining the integrity of the program's policies and guidelines.
