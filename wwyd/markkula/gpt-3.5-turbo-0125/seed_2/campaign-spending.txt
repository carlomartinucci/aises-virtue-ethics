I would advise James to reconsider his campaign strategy and spending decisions. One concrete action he could take is to forego the plan to rent several black Mercedes Benz sports cars on Election Day to drive students to classes only if they vote for his ticket. Instead, he could allocate those funds towards supporting Alix's campaign efforts to help level the playing field. Additionally, James could use his own resources and connections to help Alix with her marketing reach, such as offering to share some of his advertising spaces or providing guidance on effective campaign strategies. By taking these actions, James can demonstrate fairness, sportsmanship, and ethical leadership in the election process.
