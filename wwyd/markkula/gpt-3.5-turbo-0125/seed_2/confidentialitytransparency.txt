As Akira, I would politely but firmly ask the senator to leave the meeting in accordance with the request for confidentiality regarding the sensitive disciplinary issue involving Joshua. I would explain to the senator that the nature of the discussion requires privacy and discretion to protect the parties involved and to ensure a fair process. I would emphasize that while transparency is important, there are certain situations where confidentiality is necessary to handle sensitive matters appropriately. I would assure the senator that any decisions reached will be communicated in a transparent manner following the meeting.
