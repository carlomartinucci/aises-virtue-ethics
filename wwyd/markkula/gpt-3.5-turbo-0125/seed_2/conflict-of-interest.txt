I would recuse myself from any involvement in the evaluation and decision-making process regarding the outdoor club's petition for upper level student organization status. I would inform the relevant parties within the Associated Students organization about my potential conflict of interest and explain that I will not be participating in any discussions or decisions related to the club's application.

Additionally, I would proactively seek guidance from the organization's ethics committee or advisor to ensure that my recusal is in line with established guidelines and best practices. This step will help me maintain my reputation as an upright and impartial member of the student government while also allowing the outdoor club's petition to be evaluated fairly and objectively by others in the organization.
