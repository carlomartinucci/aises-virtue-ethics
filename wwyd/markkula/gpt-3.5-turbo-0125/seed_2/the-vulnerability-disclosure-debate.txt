I would first analyze the situation to understand the potential impact of the disclosed vulnerabilities. Then, I would review the communication channels available to facilitate dialogue between Google and Microsoft to discuss the vulnerabilities and their potential risks. I would suggest setting up a meeting or call between the security teams of both companies to share detailed information and work towards a coordinated solution.

Furthermore, I would advise Google to consider the implications of immediate public disclosure on users and work towards finding a compromise with Microsoft that ensures prompt patching while also respecting Google's disclosure policy. It is crucial to prioritize user security and collaborate effectively with Microsoft to address the vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
