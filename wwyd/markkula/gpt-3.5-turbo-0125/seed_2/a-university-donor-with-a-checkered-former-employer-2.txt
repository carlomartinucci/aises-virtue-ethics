I would thank the donor for reaching out and expressing interest in supporting our university's campaign. I would express gratitude for their willingness to contribute to our mission of expanding STEM education and increasing diversity in the field. 

Given the donor's association with the financial group known for predatory lending practices, I would diplomatically acknowledge the history of the company without directly accusing the donor of any wrongdoing, as they were not involved in those actions. I would explain that our university is committed to ethical practices and ensuring that all donations align with our values of integrity and inclusivity.

I would invite the donor to meet with me or a university representative to discuss their philanthropic goals further and explore how their contributions can make a positive impact on our students and programs. During this conversation, I would aim to understand the donor's motivations for supporting our university and assess the sincerity of their commitment to giving back to the community.

I would also consult with university leadership and the fundraising team to determine the best course of action regarding the acceptance of donations from this donor. We would consider the potential reputational risks associated with accepting funds from someone with ties to a controversial organization, even if they were not personally involved in the misconduct. Ultimately, a decision would be made based on what is in the best interest of the university's mission and values.
