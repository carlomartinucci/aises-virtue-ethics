I would schedule a meeting with my student staff to discuss the workload distribution and gather feedback on their current responsibilities. During the meeting, I would openly communicate my concerns about potentially overloading them and inquire about their capacity to handle the tasks assigned to them. I would encourage them to share any challenges they are facing and work collaboratively to find solutions.

Additionally, I would revisit my own job description and prioritize the responsibilities that directly align with the core objectives of my position, such as advocating for student financial aid and government funding at the state level. I would assess which tasks require my direct involvement and which ones could be delegated to my staff without compromising the effectiveness of the outcomes.

Based on the feedback from my team and the reassessment of my job responsibilities, I would make strategic adjustments to the workload distribution. This may involve redistributing tasks more evenly among the team members, adjusting deadlines for certain projects, or seeking additional support if necessary.

Ultimately, by addressing the workload concerns with my team, reassessing my priorities, and making informed decisions about delegation, I aim to strike a balance between fulfilling my responsibilities effectively and ensuring the well-being and productivity of my staff.
