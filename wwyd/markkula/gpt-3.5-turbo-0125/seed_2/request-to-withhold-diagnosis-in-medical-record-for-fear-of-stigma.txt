I would first listen to Sophie's concerns and empathize with her struggles. I would then explain to her the importance of addressing mental health issues openly and honestly, especially in the medical profession where well-being is crucial for patient care. I would discuss the potential risks of not disclosing her history of depression, both for her own health and for her future patients. I would strongly encourage her to seek therapy in addition to medication, as it is often more effective in treating depression in the long term.

I would respect Sophie's autonomy and confidentiality by not disclosing her mental health information to anyone without her explicit consent. However, I would emphasize the importance of seeking appropriate treatment in a transparent and responsible manner. I would provide her with resources for therapy and support her in finding a therapist who meets her needs and preferences.

Regarding the prescription of antidepressants, I would carefully consider the risks and benefits of medication in Sophie's case. Given her history of responding well to antidepressants and her willingness to engage in therapy, I would prescribe the medication while continuing to encourage her to pursue therapy as part of her treatment plan. I would document the prescription in her medical record accurately, reflecting the true reason for the medication.

Overall, my goal would be to support Sophie in addressing her mental health concerns in a comprehensive and ethical manner, ensuring her well-being while also upholding professional standards and responsibilities.
