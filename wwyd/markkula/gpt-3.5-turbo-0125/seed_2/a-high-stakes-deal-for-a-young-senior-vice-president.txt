Tim should immediately refuse the bribe from Sam and express his concerns about the altered agreement. He should inform Sam that he cannot proceed with the deal under such circumstances and that he will report the attempted bribery and document tampering to his own company's compliance department and the appropriate regulatory authorities. Tim should also seek advice from a trusted mentor or legal counsel within the company to understand the potential consequences of Sam's actions and his own responsibilities in this situation. Additionally, Tim should document all interactions and evidence related to the attempted bribery and altered agreement to protect himself and ensure transparency in case of any future investigations.
