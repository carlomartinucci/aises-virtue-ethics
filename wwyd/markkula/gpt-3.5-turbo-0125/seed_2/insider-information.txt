In this situation, I would suggest that Drake meet with Alex to provide general advice and guidance that is applicable to all student organizations, rather than offering personalized advice specific to Alex's club's proposal. This way, Drake can support Alex in a fair and ethical manner without giving him an unfair advantage over other student groups. By focusing on general tips and strategies that can benefit all student clubs and societies, Drake can uphold his professional ethics and ensure fairness in the funding process.
