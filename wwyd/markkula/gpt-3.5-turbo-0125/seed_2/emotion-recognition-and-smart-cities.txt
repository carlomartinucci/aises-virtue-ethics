I would first research the capabilities and limitations of the emotion-recognition AI technology being proposed by the technology company. Next, I would carefully review the privacy policies and data security measures in place to ensure that the identities of individuals captured in the video recordings are protected. I would then consult with legal experts to assess the compliance of this proposal with existing data protection laws and regulations. Finally, I would present a detailed report to the city leaders outlining the potential benefits and risks of granting access to the video recordings, along with recommendations for ensuring the ethical use of the technology while safeguarding the privacy of the city's residents.
