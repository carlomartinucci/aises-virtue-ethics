I would advise Dave to immediately stop the arrangement with Alex and report the illegal activities of the non-profit managers to the appropriate authorities. Dave should explain the situation truthfully, providing any evidence he has gathered, and cooperate fully with any investigations. He should also seek guidance from his organization's leadership and legal team on how to proceed in a way that upholds ethical standards and abides by the law. It is crucial for Dave to prioritize transparency, honesty, and accountability in handling this complex ethical dilemma.
