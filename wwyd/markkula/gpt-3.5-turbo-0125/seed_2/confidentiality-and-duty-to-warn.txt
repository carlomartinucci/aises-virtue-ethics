I would immediately address the concerning statements made by the client about wanting to stalk Susan and her new boyfriend. I would explain to the client that these thoughts and desires are not appropriate or healthy, and could potentially lead to harmful or illegal behavior. I would emphasize the importance of respecting boundaries and the autonomy of others. I would explore with the client the underlying feelings of rejection and jealousy that may be fueling these thoughts, and work with him to find healthier coping strategies. I would also assess the client's risk of acting on these thoughts and develop a safety plan if necessary, which may include involving other mental health professionals or authorities for additional support and monitoring.
