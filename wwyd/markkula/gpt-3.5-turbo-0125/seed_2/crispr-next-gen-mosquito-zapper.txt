In response to the urgent outbreak of Zika in Brazil, I would work with Kill-M to implement the CRISPR sterile insect technology in a targeted and controlled manner. Specifically, I would:

1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment and environmental impact study to understand the potential consequences of releasing genetically modified mosquitoes into the Brazilian ecosystem.
2. Collaborate with local ecologists, entomologists, and environmental experts to evaluate the potential effects on biodiversity, including predator species and plant pollination.
3. Develop a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plan to track the long-term effects of the genetically modified mosquitoes on the ecosystem.
4. Work with the Brazilian Department of Public Health to establish specific goals for reducing the mosquito population based on scientific evidence and public health needs.
5. Implement strict containment measures to prevent the spread of the genetically modified mosquitoes beyond the targeted area.
6. Provide transparent communication to the public about the project, its objectives, and the potential risks and benefits involved.
7. Continuously assess and adapt the project based on new information and feedback from stakeholders to ensure its effectiveness and minimize unintended consequences.
