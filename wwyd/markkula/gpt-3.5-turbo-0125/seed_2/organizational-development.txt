I would recommend that Carlos explore alternative funding options for the retreat before considering taking money from programs that directly benefit the student body. This could include reaching out to potential sponsors or donors, organizing fundraising events specifically for the retreat, or seeking out grants or scholarships that could help cover the increased cost of the retreat. By actively seeking out alternative funding sources, Carlos may be able to preserve the funding for important student government programs while still ensuring the success of the retreat.
