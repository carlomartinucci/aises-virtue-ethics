I would advise Derek to consider scheduling a meeting with the Vice Provost to express his concerns about the situation with the off-campus fraternities and sororities. During the meeting, he should present the perspective of the students involved in Greek life and emphasize the importance of addressing their issues. Derek can highlight the impact of the targeted thefts on student safety and well-being, as well as the potential repercussions on campus if these concerns are not addressed.

Additionally, Derek should propose potential solutions or actions that the university could take to support the affected students, while also aligning with the administration's goals and objectives. By approaching the Vice Provost in a constructive and collaborative manner, Derek may be able to bridge the gap between student needs and administrative constraints, ultimately finding a way to address the situation effectively.

It is important for Derek to maintain open communication with both the students and the administration, ensuring that all perspectives are considered and that efforts are made to find a balanced and satisfactory resolution to the issues at hand.
