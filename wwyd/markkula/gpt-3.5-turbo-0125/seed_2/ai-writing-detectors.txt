Given the scenario, I would recommend that educational institutions using Turnitin's AI detection feature should consider implementing a multi-step process when handling cases of suspected plagiarism. This process could involve human review of flagged submissions, especially in cases where the author is a non-native English speaker or where the tool's accuracy may be in question. Additionally, institutions should provide clear guidelines to students about the limitations of AI detection tools and the steps that will be taken to verify any suspected cases of plagiarism. Finally, institutions should prioritize fairness and due process when dealing with plagiarism allegations, ensuring that students have the opportunity to explain or contest any flagged content before any adverse actions are taken.
