I would schedule individual meetings with each board member to discuss their level of engagement and commitment to the organization. During these meetings, I would communicate the vision and goals of the nonprofit, emphasizing the potential for growth and increased impact in the community. I would ask for their input on how they see themselves contributing to these goals and address any concerns they may have about their role on the board. Additionally, I would explore opportunities for board training and development to increase their understanding of their responsibilities and the organization's needs.
