In Olivia's position, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Review the university's rules and guidelines regarding campaigning for ASI president to ensure compliance with ethical standards and fairness.
2. Seek advice from a trusted mentor or advisor within the university to discuss any concerns about the timing of implementing initiatives for personal gain.
3. Consider disclosing to the ASI board or relevant university officials about the advanced planning for the election campaign to maintain transparency and address any potential conflicts of interest.
4. Evaluate the timeline of the planned events for the Community Relations Branch and consider adjusting them to a more neutral timeframe to avoid any perception of using them solely for campaign purposes.
5. Reflect on the original intention behind running for ASI president and ensure that the focus remains on making a positive impact on the student body rather than personal gain.
