I would suggest that Marcus appoint the third spot in the executive cabinet to a candidate who is not directly tied to any of the election campaigns. This would help ensure a balanced and diverse perspective within the cabinet, avoiding potential biases or conflicts that could arise from appointing only candidates from the election. This neutral appointment would also demonstrate a commitment to fairness and inclusivity in decision-making processes within the student government organization.
