In Callie's situation, I would first prioritize fairness and inclusivity. I would immediately contact the school administration and explain the situation regarding the extra five tickets. I would propose a solution where an announcement is made to the entire senior class, informing them of the error and the availability of five additional tickets. I would suggest that interested seniors submit their names to a lottery system, where the five tickets would be randomly allocated to ensure equal opportunity for all students who missed out initially. This way, Callie can uphold the integrity of the ticket distribution process while also managing her time effectively in the lead-up to the event.
