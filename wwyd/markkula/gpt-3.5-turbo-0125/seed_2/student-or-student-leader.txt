I would approach the two affected senators individually to discuss the situation. I would express understanding for their predicament and the importance of their academic commitments. I would propose the possibility of designating a proxy for each of them to represent their constituents and vote on their behalf during Senate meetings. I would also suggest that they provide input and guidance to their proxies in order to ensure that their constituents' concerns are properly addressed. If they agree to this arrangement, I would bring the proposal to the Senate for discussion and approval to officially allow proxies for the two senators with class conflicts.
