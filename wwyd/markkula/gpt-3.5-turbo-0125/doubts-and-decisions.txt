In Leah's position, I would express my gratitude to the President and Vice President for offering me the Director of Marketing position. I would then ask for some time to carefully consider the offer and discuss it with my friend who wanted the position. I would also schedule a meeting with the President and Vice President to discuss my concerns and share my thoughts on how I could contribute effectively in the role. During this meeting, I would express my passion for student government and my desire to explore other areas within the organization. I would also inquire about potential opportunities to contribute to leadership development, community service, or women's affairs initiatives in addition to marketing.

After gathering more information and perspectives, I would make a decision based on what aligns best with my personal interests, skills, and long-term goals, while also considering the needs of the organization and the potential impact on my friend. If I ultimately decide to accept the Director of Marketing position, I would communicate openly and honestly with my friend, explaining my reasons for accepting the role and reassuring her of my continued support and collaboration.
