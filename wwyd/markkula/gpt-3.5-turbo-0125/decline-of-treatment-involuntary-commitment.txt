I would first ensure Julia's immediate safety by removing the unopened bottle of powerful pain medication from her possession. I would then conduct a thorough assessment of her current mental health status, including asking direct questions about suicidal thoughts and intentions. I would also explore her past experiences with treatment for depression to understand her concerns and reservations.

Given Julia's reluctance to involve her parents and her resistance to traditional treatment options, I would respect her autonomy as an adult and maintain confidentiality unless there is an imminent risk of harm to herself. I would try to build rapport with her and explore alternative approaches to managing her depression that she may be more open to, such as therapy or lifestyle changes.

I would emphasize the importance of ongoing support and monitoring for her mental health, and encourage her to reach out for help if she experiences worsening symptoms or thoughts of self-harm. I would also provide her with resources for crisis intervention and support services in case she needs immediate assistance in the future.
