I would review the current policies and procedures in place at the University of Arizona regarding the collection and use of student data. I would assess whether these practices align with ethical standards and legal requirements, particularly in terms of data privacy and student consent. If necessary, I would recommend conducting a thorough review of the data collection methods and the potential impact on student privacy. Additionally, I would suggest establishing clear guidelines for transparency and communication with students regarding the collection and use of their data, ensuring that they are informed and have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their participation in such initiatives.
