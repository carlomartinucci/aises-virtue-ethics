I would conduct a thorough review of the current practices and policies regarding the use of the Cogito software at MetLife. This review would include examining the extent of monitoring and analysis conducted by the software, as well as the notifications provided to both employees and customers about the nature of the analysis being performed on their interactions. Additionally, I would assess the transparency and consent mechanisms in place to ensure that both employees and customers are fully informed about how their data is being used.

Based on the findings of the review, I would work with relevant stakeholders, including management, legal, and compliance teams, to develop and implement clear and comprehensive disclosure policies. These policies would aim to provide transparent information to both employees and customers about the specific types of analysis being conducted by the software, as well as the purposes for which the data is being used. I would also ensure that mechanisms are in place for obtaining explicit consent from all parties involved before any data is collected or analyzed.

Furthermore, I would collaborate with the IT and data security teams to enhance data protection measures and ensure that all data collected by the software is handled in compliance with relevant privacy regulations. This would involve implementing robust security protocols, data encryption, and access controls to safeguard the sensitive information being processed by the AI software.

Overall, my actions would focus on promoting transparency, accountability, and data protection in the use of the Cogito software at MetLife to uphold ethical standards and respect the rights of both employees and customers.
