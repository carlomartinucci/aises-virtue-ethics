I would recommend that the creators of PunkSpider continue to emphasize the importance of responsible disclosure and ethical hacking practices in their communications and documentation. They should clearly outline the potential risks associated with publicly disclosing vulnerabilities and provide guidance on how website administrators can address and patch these vulnerabilities promptly. Additionally, I would suggest that they actively engage with the cybersecurity community to gather feedback on how to improve the tool's impact while minimizing the potential for malicious exploitation of disclosed vulnerabilities.
