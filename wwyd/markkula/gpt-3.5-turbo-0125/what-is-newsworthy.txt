I would suggest that Fatimah consult with her editor or supervisor to discuss her concerns about tweeting campus safety reports. She should express her reservations about the newsworthiness of such reports and the ethical implications of sharing potentially sensitive information for entertainment purposes. Together, they can review the newspaper's editorial guidelines and policies to determine if tweeting these reports aligns with the publication's values and standards. Additionally, they could consider alternative ways to engage students on social media without compromising journalistic integrity.
