I would schedule a meeting with my student staff to discuss the current workload distribution and gather feedback on how they are managing their responsibilities. During the meeting, I would openly communicate my concerns about potentially overloading them and inquire about their capacity to handle the tasks they have been delegated. I would also seek their input on how we can collectively address the situation and ensure that all essential responsibilities are being effectively managed.

Based on the feedback received from my staff, I would reassess the delegation of tasks within the team. I would prioritize the state-level duties related to student financial aid and government funding, recognizing their critical importance to the student body. I would work with my staff to redistribute responsibilities in a way that ensures these crucial tasks are being adequately addressed while also considering their existing workloads and areas of expertise.

Additionally, I would explore potential strategies to streamline processes, improve efficiency, and possibly seek additional support or resources to help manage the workload more effectively. It is essential to find a balance between community relations and state-level advocacy to fulfill the responsibilities of my position comprehensively and effectively.
