I would convene a meeting with representatives from both student organizations and faculty members to discuss the issue. During the meeting, I would explain the concerns about email volume and student dissatisfaction with the current system. I would propose a solution where faculty members could submit their information to be included in the weekly email newsletter, ensuring that students still receive valuable information without overwhelming them with additional emails. I would also suggest exploring alternative communication channels for faculty members to reach students, such as utilizing the student government's social media platforms or creating a separate email list specifically for faculty announcements. By facilitating this discussion and proposing a compromise solution, I aim to address the concerns of both student organizations and faculty members while maintaining the integrity of the email list system.
