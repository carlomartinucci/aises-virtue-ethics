In Marcus's position, I would first conduct individual interviews with each of the opposing candidates who expressed willingness to take other positions within the executive cabinet. During these interviews, I would focus on assessing their motivations, their vision for the student government, and their willingness to work collaboratively despite the election outcome. I would also inquire about their specific ideas for contributing to the organization and how they plan to support unity within the team.

After the interviews, I would carefully evaluate the responses and consider the potential impact of each candidate on the executive cabinet's dynamic. I would prioritize selecting a candidate who demonstrates a genuine commitment to the organization's goals and values, regardless of the election outcome. I would also consider the candidate's ability to set aside personal feelings and work constructively with Marcus and the rest of the team.

Ultimately, I would make a decision based on the candidate who aligns most closely with the organization's mission, values, and the need for unity within the team. I would communicate my decision respectfully and transparently to all candidates, emphasizing the importance of working together towards a common goal for the benefit of the student body.
