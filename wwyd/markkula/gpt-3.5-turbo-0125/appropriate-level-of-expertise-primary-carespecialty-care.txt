I would continue to emphasize the importance of seeking a psychiatric evaluation from a qualified psychiatrist to properly assess and diagnose any potential mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder. I would explain to Peter that while I value his trust in me as his primary care physician, it is crucial to involve a specialist in mental health to ensure he receives the most appropriate care and treatment. I would offer to assist him in finding a psychiatrist and provide information on the benefits of a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional. If Peter continues to refuse, I would document our conversation thoroughly in his medical records and continue to monitor his symptoms closely while encouraging him to reconsider seeking help from a psychiatrist.
