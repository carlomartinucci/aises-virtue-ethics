Bruce should first consult with HR and legal counsel to fully understand the legal obligations and potential accommodations required for Spencer's emotional support animal. He should also gather more information about the specific needs of the students and staff, including any allergies or phobias related to dogs. Bruce should then have a meeting with Spencer to discuss potential accommodations and find a solution that meets both Spencer's needs and the organization's constraints. This could involve exploring alternative housing options, setting boundaries for the dog's presence, and discussing transportation arrangements. Bruce should also consider the impact on the overall student experience and staff well-being before making a final decision.
