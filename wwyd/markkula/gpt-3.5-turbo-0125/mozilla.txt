I would acknowledge Brendan Eich's resignation as CEO and respect his decision. I would then work with the board and other key stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition in leadership, focusing on maintaining the organization's mission and values. I would communicate openly and transparently with employees, contributors, and the wider community to address any concerns or questions that may arise from this change in leadership. Additionally, I would review and update any relevant policies or procedures to prevent similar controversies in the future and ensure alignment with the organization's values and goals.
