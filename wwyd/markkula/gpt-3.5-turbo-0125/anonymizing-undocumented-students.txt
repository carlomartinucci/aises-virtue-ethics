I would advise Jessica to prioritize Adam's safety and well-being above concerns about using anonymous sources. I would suggest that she explain to Adam the potential risks of having his name included in the article, such as the possibility of being reported to ICE or facing other negative consequences. I would recommend that Jessica assure Adam that she respects his decision to remain anonymous and that she will find ways to corroborate his story through other means, such as providing additional context or statistics on the impact of immigration policies on students.

Additionally, I would suggest that Jessica discuss with Anthony, the news editor, about the importance of protecting Adam's identity in the article. I would recommend that she propose alternative ways to verify the credibility of Adam's story without compromising his safety, such as seeking input from other undocumented students or immigration advocates who can vouch for the authenticity of his experiences.

Overall, my specific actions would focus on supporting Jessica in maintaining the trust and safety of her sources, particularly in sensitive and potentially risky situations like this one.
