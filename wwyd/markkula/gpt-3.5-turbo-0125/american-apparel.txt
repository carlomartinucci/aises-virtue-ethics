In this scenario, I would first review the company's code of conduct and policies regarding ethical practices and workplace behavior. I would then conduct an investigation into the allegations of sexual harassment and misuse of company funds against Dov Charney to gather all relevant information and evidence.

Next, I would consult with HR and legal counsel to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to address the situation in accordance with company policies and applicable laws. This may involve disciplinary actions, termination of employment, or other appropriate measures based on the findings of the investigation.

I would also work with the board of directors and relevant stakeholders to ensure transparency and communication regarding the actions being taken and the impact on the company's governance and operations. Additionally, I would collaborate with the new directors appointed by Standard General to facilitate a smooth transition and maintain stability within the organization.

Throughout this process, I would prioritize the well-being of employees, customers, and the company as a whole, while upholding the values of passion, innovation, and ethical practices that American Apparel aims to embody.
