I would first gather all available information and data regarding the MiDAS system and its impact on Michigan residents. This would include reviewing the Detroit Free Press article, the IEEE Spectrum article, and the Time magazine article to understand the scope of the issue and the specific challenges faced by the affected individuals.

Next, I would reach out to advocacy groups, legal aid organizations, and community leaders in Michigan to learn more about the ongoing lawsuits and efforts to seek justice for those impacted by the faulty system. By engaging with these stakeholders, I could gain insights into the specific needs and concerns of the affected residents.

I would then work to raise awareness about the issue by collaborating with media outlets to highlight the stories of those who have been wronged by the MiDAS system. By amplifying their voices and shedding light on the injustices they have faced, we can build public support for holding the responsible parties to account.

Additionally, I would explore avenues for providing immediate assistance to those who have suffered financial hardship as a result of the system's errors. This could involve connecting them with resources for legal aid, financial counseling, or other forms of support to help mitigate the impact of the wrongful accusations.

Finally, I would advocate for greater transparency and accountability in the use of automated systems by government agencies. By pushing for reforms that ensure proper oversight and accountability for algorithmic decision-making processes, we can help prevent similar injustices from occurring in the future.
