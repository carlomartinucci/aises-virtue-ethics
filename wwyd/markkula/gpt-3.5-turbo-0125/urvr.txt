If I were in this scenario, I would first review the company's privacy policy and terms of service to ensure that they are clear and transparent about how user data is handled. I would then conduct regular audits to verify that the company is indeed deleting all 360 degree videos and images within 24 hours, as stated in their license agreement. Additionally, I would implement strict security measures to protect user data and ensure that unauthorized access to the content is prevented. In case of any breaches or violations of user privacy, I would promptly investigate the issue, take appropriate action, and notify the affected users as required by law.
