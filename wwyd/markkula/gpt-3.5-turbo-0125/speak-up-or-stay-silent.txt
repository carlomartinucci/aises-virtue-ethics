Tre should schedule a meeting with his direct supervisor to discuss his concerns about the discrepancy in the recording of sales. During the meeting, he should present the specific instances where sales of basic products were inaccurately classified as sales of advanced products. Tre should express his worries about the potential impact on investors and the company's reputation for honesty. He should also inquire about the rationale behind this practice to gain a better understanding of the situation.

Tre should emphasize his commitment to integrity and ethical business practices while acknowledging the challenging circumstances, including the fear of potential layoffs. By addressing the issue directly with his supervisor, Tre can demonstrate his professionalism, attention to detail, and dedication to upholding ethical standards within the company. This approach allows Tre to raise his concerns in a constructive manner while seeking clarification and potential solutions.
