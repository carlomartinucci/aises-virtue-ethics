I would advise Ben to prioritize honesty and integrity in this situation. He should disclose all the information he knows about Michael's fraudulent activities to the company's internal investigation team. By providing this crucial information, Ben can help the company understand the extent of the issue and take appropriate actions to address it. While Ben may feel conflicted about potentially jeopardizing his own position or his friendship with Michael, it is essential to prioritize ethical behavior and the well-being of the company as a whole. Ben should also consider seeking guidance from a trusted mentor or HR representative within the company to navigate this challenging situation effectively.
