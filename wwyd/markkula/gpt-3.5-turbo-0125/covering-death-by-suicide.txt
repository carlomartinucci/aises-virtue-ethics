I would advise Hana to cover the story of her classmate's death in a sensitive and responsible manner. She should focus on celebrating his life and contributions to the campus community, highlighting his involvement in student government, environmental justice advocacy, and interfaith programming. Hana should also address the importance of mental health care and resources available on campus, emphasizing healthy coping mechanisms and support services for students struggling with mental health issues.

To minimize the risk of harm, Hana should avoid including graphic details of the death and follow the guidelines provided by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. She should also include helpline information and resources for those in need of support. Additionally, Hana should be mindful of not sensationalizing the tragedy or pandering to morbid curiosity, as this would be disrespectful to the mourning family and the student's memory.

By covering this story thoughtfully and responsibly, Hana can help raise awareness about mental health issues, reduce stigma, and promote a dialogue about the importance of seeking help and support when needed.
