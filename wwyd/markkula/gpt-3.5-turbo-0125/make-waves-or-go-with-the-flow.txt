I would advise Claire to have a private conversation with Fred to express her concerns about the unrealistic budgeted hours for the audit engagement. During this conversation, Claire should provide specific examples of tasks that are taking longer than expected and explain the reasons behind the need for additional hours to complete the work thoroughly. Claire should also inquire about any specific strategies or resources that Fred recommends to improve efficiency without compromising the quality of the audit work.

Additionally, I would suggest that Claire document her concerns and any guidance provided by Fred in writing to ensure clarity and accountability. This documentation could be useful in case there are any future misunderstandings or disputes regarding the allocation of hours on the time sheets.

Regarding the firm training that needs to be completed, I would recommend that Claire and her team members discuss with Fred or another appropriate supervisor about how to properly account for the time spent on training over the weekend. It is important to clarify whether this time should be charged to training or if there are alternative arrangements that can be made to ensure compliance with the firm's requirements while also meeting the demands of the audit engagement.
