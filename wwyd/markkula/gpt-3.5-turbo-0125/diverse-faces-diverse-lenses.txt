In response to the situation regarding the Diversity in Faces (DiF) dataset created by IBM Research, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Conduct an internal review within IBM Research to assess the process and criteria used for selecting and annotating the images in the DiF dataset.
2. Reach out to the photographers whose images were included in the dataset to inform them of the situation and offer a clear and accessible process for requesting the removal of their photos.
3. Implement a transparent and user-friendly mechanism on the IBM Research website for individuals to easily identify if their photos are included in the dataset and request removal.
4. Review and update the data sharing agreements with organizations that have already accessed the dataset to ensure compliance with any new removal requests.
5. Engage with external experts in ethics, privacy, and data protection to provide guidance on best practices for handling sensitive data in AI research projects.
6. Issue a public statement acknowledging the concerns raised by media reports and outlining the steps being taken to address them, along with a commitment to upholding ethical standards in future research endeavors.
