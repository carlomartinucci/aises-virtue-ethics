I would advise Snapchat's board of directors to conduct a thorough investigation into the situation, including gathering all relevant information about the emails and their context. This investigation should involve interviewing Evan Spiegel, reviewing any other potential evidence, and consulting with legal counsel to understand any potential legal implications. Based on the findings of the investigation, the board should then determine the appropriate course of action, which may include issuing a public statement, implementing disciplinary measures, or considering Spiegel's continued role as CEO. It is crucial to handle the situation transparently and in a manner that upholds the company's values and reputation.
