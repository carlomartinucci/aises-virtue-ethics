I would suggest that Jennifer have a conversation with Ishmael to express her concerns about the potential cultural insensitivity of his article. During this conversation, Jennifer could explain the cultural significance of boba to many students at their school and how Ishmael's language may come across as disrespectful or offensive to some readers. Jennifer could propose that Ishmael consider revising his piece to maintain his critical perspective on boba while avoiding language that could be perceived as derogatory or insensitive towards a particular culture. Additionally, Jennifer could offer to collaborate with Ishmael on editing his article to ensure that it respects cultural differences and fosters a more inclusive dialogue about boba within the school community.
