I would first review the applications of the remaining candidates to see if any of them have relevant experience or skills that could potentially make them suitable for the specific committees needing representation. If I find a candidate who could be a good fit with some additional training or support, I would consider reaching out to them to discuss the expectations and requirements of the committee roles to see if they are willing to put in the effort to meet those needs.

If after this review I still feel that the remaining candidates are not the best fit for the committees, I would then consider reaching out to my friends who I believe would be strong candidates for the positions. I would explain the situation to them and encourage them to apply, ensuring that they understand the importance of the roles and the responsibilities that come with them.

In the end, my priority would be to ensure that the committees are represented by individuals who can contribute effectively and provide valuable insights, while also being fair and transparent in the selection process.
