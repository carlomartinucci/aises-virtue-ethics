In Olivia's position, I would first consult with a trusted mentor or advisor within the university's administration to discuss my concerns about the timing of implementing the initiatives and events for the Community Relations Branch in relation to my upcoming campaign for ASI president. I would seek guidance on the ethical implications of using my current role to potentially benefit my future campaign.

Additionally, I would consider being transparent with my fellow ASI members about my intentions and seek their feedback on the situation. It is important to maintain open communication and ensure that my actions are aligned with the values and principles of the student government organization.

Furthermore, I would evaluate the timeline of the events and initiatives to see if there are ways to adjust them to ensure that they are implemented in a fair and equitable manner, without giving undue advantage to my campaign. This may involve reevaluating the scheduling of events to avoid any perception of using resources for personal gain.

Overall, I would prioritize integrity and fairness in my decision-making process and take proactive steps to address any ethical concerns that may arise from the situation.
