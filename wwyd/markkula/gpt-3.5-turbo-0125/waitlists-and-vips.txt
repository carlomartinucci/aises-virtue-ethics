In Callie's situation, I would immediately rectify the errors in data entry and ensure that the five remaining tickets are allocated fairly. I would reach out to the senior class through a quick email explaining the situation and offering the tickets on a first-come, first-served basis. This way, I can ensure that the tickets are distributed equitably among those who missed out initially, without favoritism or bias towards my friends. This approach would also save time compared to creating a waiting list and drawing names, allowing me to focus on the final preparations for the event.
