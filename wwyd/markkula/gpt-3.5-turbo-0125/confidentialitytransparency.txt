If I were Akira, I would calmly explain to the senator that while I understand his concerns about transparency, the nature of the issue at hand requires confidentiality to protect the privacy of the individuals involved. I would emphasize that discussing sensitive disciplinary matters in a public setting could harm the reputation and well-being of the student in question. I would also express my commitment to addressing the issue with integrity and fairness, and assure the senator that the decision-making process will be thorough and just.

If the senator continues to insist on staying, I would reiterate the importance of maintaining confidentiality and the need to follow proper procedures in handling disciplinary matters. I would respectfully but firmly ask the senator to respect the privacy of those involved and to trust in the student government's ability to address the issue appropriately. If necessary, I would offer to provide the senator with a summary of the proceedings after the meeting to ensure transparency and accountability.

Ultimately, my priority would be to handle the situation with sensitivity and professionalism, while upholding the principles of fairness and privacy in dealing with disciplinary issues within the student government.
