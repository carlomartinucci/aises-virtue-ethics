I would suggest that Tyler schedule a meeting with his fellow Senators to discuss his concerns about balancing committee work with connecting with his constituents. During the meeting, Tyler can propose the idea of rotating responsibilities within the committee to allow each member to spend more time engaging with the student body. By presenting this as a collaborative effort to better serve the student community, Tyler can demonstrate his commitment to both his committee work and his constituents. This approach may also help alleviate any concerns about appearing lazy or unproductive to his peers, as it shows that Tyler is actively seeking ways to improve his representation of the student body.
