I would suggest that Mary first try to have a private conversation with Donald to express her concerns and explore potential compromises. She could propose alternatives such as hiring professional management to oversee the building, which could potentially increase its value and generate income in the future. Mary could also suggest exploring other ways to address Donald's desire to exit the business without selling the building, such as negotiating a buyout at a discounted rate that is more in line with market practices for minority shareholders.

If Donald remains firm in his stance and insists on selling the building, Mary should then focus on communicating openly and transparently with all shareholders about the potential consequences of selling, including the significant tax implications and the impact on her financial well-being. She should also emphasize the sentimental and historical value of the building to the family and the community.

In terms of ethical considerations, Mary should prioritize honesty, fairness, and open communication in her interactions with her family members. She should strive to find a solution that balances her financial interests with the long-term sustainability and legacy of the family business. Mary should also consider the potential impact of her decisions on the relationships within the family and work towards maintaining harmony and understanding among all shareholders.
