I would first meet with the two senators individually to discuss the situation and explore potential solutions. For the senior senator, I would inquire if there is any possibility of arranging an alternative schedule for the class that would still allow them to graduate on time. I would offer to assist in communicating with the professor or academic advisor if needed.

For the junior senator, I would explore the option of finding a suitable proxy to attend the Senate meetings on their behalf. This proxy could provide updates on discussions and votes, ensuring that the concerns of the constituents are still represented. I would work with the junior senator to identify a responsible and trustworthy proxy who can fulfill this role effectively.

Additionally, I would review the attendance policy with the senators and discuss the possibility of making an exception in this unique circumstance. I would present a proposal to the Senate for a temporary adjustment to the attendance policy to accommodate the senators' class schedules, emphasizing the importance of supporting their academic pursuits while still fulfilling their responsibilities in student government.

Overall, my approach would involve proactive communication with the senators, exploring alternative solutions, and advocating for a temporary policy adjustment to address the conflict between their academic commitments and their roles in student government.
