I would advise Elena to have a conversation with Jack about the inaccuracies in his piece regarding the university's affirmative action policies. I would suggest that Elena explain to Jack the information she obtained from the Admissions Office, clarifying that the university does not practice affirmative action. I would recommend that Elena work with Jack to revise his article to ensure it accurately reflects the university's admission process. This way, Elena can uphold the standards of accuracy in journalism while still allowing Jack to express his opinion and contribute to the debate on the topic.
