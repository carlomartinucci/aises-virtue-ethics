In Karina's position, I would schedule a meeting with key members from both the Senate and the Executive Cabinet to facilitate a constructive dialogue. During the meeting, I would create a safe space for each side to express their concerns and perspectives openly and respectfully. I would encourage active listening and seek to find common ground between the two branches.

Additionally, I would propose a compromise solution that takes into account the concerns raised by both sides regarding the attendance policy. This could involve revising the policy to address the Senate's worries about paternalism while still maintaining the Executive Cabinet's goal of improving overall accountability within the organization.

Furthermore, I would emphasize the importance of collaboration and unity within the student government, highlighting that both branches ultimately share the same goal of serving the student body effectively. By fostering open communication and finding a middle ground, I believe it is possible to resolve the conflict and move forward in a more cohesive manner.
