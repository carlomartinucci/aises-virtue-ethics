I would schedule a meeting with the staff at the sexual assault prevention center to discuss the issue of vague and potentially inaccessible information for neurodiverse individuals. During the meeting, I would bring up the specific concerns regarding the current descriptions of consent and how they may not be effectively reaching neurodiverse students. I would propose the idea of creating new materials that are more concrete and clear in defining consent, possibly incorporating visual aids or step-by-step guides that can be universally understood. I would offer to collaborate with the staff to develop these revised materials and ensure that they are inclusive and accessible to all students, including those who are neurodiverse.
