I would schedule a meeting with Kyle's parents to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of enrolling him at Eminent Scholars. During the meeting, I would present detailed information about the school's personalized education approach, flexibility in scheduling, and tailored learning experiences that could address Kyle's academic needs and sleep issues. I would also address the parents' concerns about limited social interaction opportunities by explaining how the school could still facilitate social skills development through structured activities, group projects, and extracurricular programs. Additionally, I would offer to arrange a visit to Eminent Scholars for Kyle and his parents to observe the learning environment firsthand and meet with the staff to address any remaining questions or concerns.
