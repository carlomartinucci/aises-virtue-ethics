I would first express empathy and understanding towards Sophie for opening up about her struggles with depression. I would then explain to her the importance of honesty and transparency in medical records, especially when it comes to mental health issues. I would emphasize the potential risks and consequences of not accurately documenting her medical history, including the impact it could have on her future medical licensure applications.

I would recommend that Sophie seek therapy in addition to considering antidepressant medication, as this holistic approach is often more effective in managing depression. I would stress the importance of addressing the underlying issues contributing to her depression through therapy, rather than solely relying on medication.

I would offer to help Sophie find a therapist who she feels comfortable with and who can provide the support she needs. I would reassure her that seeking help for mental health issues is a sign of strength and resilience, and that there is no shame in needing support.

I would explain to Sophie that while I understand her concerns about the impact of a history of depression on her medical licensure applications, it is crucial for her long-term well-being and success as a physician to prioritize her mental health and seek appropriate treatment. I would encourage her to focus on her recovery and well-being, and assure her that I will support her throughout this process.
