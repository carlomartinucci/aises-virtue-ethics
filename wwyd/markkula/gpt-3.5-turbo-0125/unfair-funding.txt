I would suggest that Claire implement a new policy where any member of the funding committee who is also a leader of a club must recuse themselves from the decision-making process when their club's funding request is being discussed. This would help ensure impartiality and prevent any potential conflicts of interest. Additionally, Claire could consider rotating the leadership of the funding committee to different members on a regular basis to further promote fairness and transparency in the decision-making process.
