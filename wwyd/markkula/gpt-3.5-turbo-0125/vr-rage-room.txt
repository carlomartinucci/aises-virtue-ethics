If I were in this scenario, I would first review the terms of service and guidelines provided by GoldCat to ensure a clear understanding of what is allowed and what is prohibited on the VR Rage Room app. 

Next, I would actively monitor the content uploaded by users to ensure that no scenarios involve directing VR violence at humans. This would involve regularly checking new uploads, user reviews, and reports of inappropriate content. 

If I come across any content that violates the terms of service, specifically scenarios involving violence towards humans, I would immediately remove it from the app and notify the user responsible for the upload about the violation. Depending on the severity of the violation, I would also take appropriate action, which may include suspending or banning the user from the platform. 

Additionally, I would provide clear guidelines and examples of acceptable content to users to help prevent future violations. Regular communication with users about the importance of following the guidelines and respecting the terms of service would be crucial in maintaining a safe and appropriate environment for all users of the VR Rage Room app.
