I would conduct a thorough review of the proctoring software being used at our institution to identify any potential biases in the system, particularly in face detection algorithms. I would collaborate with the IT department and relevant stakeholders to assess the impact of these biases on students and ensure that any discriminatory features are addressed promptly. Additionally, I would gather feedback from students and professors about their experiences with the proctoring software to understand their concerns and perspectives. Based on this information, I would make an informed decision on whether to continue using the software or explore alternative solutions for exam monitoring that prioritize fairness and student well-being.
