I would recommend that IKEA take the following specific actions to address the issue of child labor in its supply chain:

1. Implement a strict supplier code of conduct that explicitly prohibits the use of child labor in any stage of production. This code of conduct should be communicated clearly to all suppliers and enforced through regular audits and inspections.

2. Establish a dedicated team within the company to monitor and evaluate the working conditions at supplier factories, especially those in countries with a high risk of child labor. This team should conduct regular on-site visits to verify compliance with the supplier code of conduct.

3. Provide training and education programs for both IKEA employees and suppliers on the importance of ethical sourcing practices and the negative impacts of child labor. This should include specific training on how to identify and report instances of child labor.

4. Collaborate with local NGOs and labor rights organizations in countries where IKEA operates to support initiatives aimed at eliminating child labor and improving working conditions in the supply chain.

5. Develop a transparent reporting mechanism for stakeholders to raise concerns or report instances of child labor within the supply chain. This could include a hotline or online platform where employees, suppliers, or customers can anonymously report any violations.

By taking these concrete actions, IKEA can demonstrate its commitment to addressing the issue of child labor in its supply chain and work towards ensuring ethical and responsible sourcing practices.
