I would advocate for the inclusion of the Navajo tribe in the negotiations and decision-making processes regarding water allocation from the Colorado River. Specifically, I would work to ensure that representatives from the Navajo Nation are invited to participate in discussions with state legislators and other stakeholders to address the tribe's water rights and access issues. Additionally, I would support efforts to implement safe and reliable water sources for all members of the Navajo Nation, in line with principles of environmental justice and human rights.
