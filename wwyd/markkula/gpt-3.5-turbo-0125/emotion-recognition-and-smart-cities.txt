I would first review the privacy policies and terms of service of the technology company to ensure that they have robust data protection measures in place. I would also consult with legal experts to understand the implications of sharing video recordings with a third party, even if they claim not to identify individuals. Additionally, I would seek input from the city's residents through public forums or surveys to gauge their opinions on the proposal. If the feedback is generally positive and the legal aspects are sound, I would negotiate a detailed agreement with the technology company outlining strict data usage and protection protocols before granting them access to the video recordings.
