I would advise Grace to have an open and honest conversation with the senior members of the student government about her situation. She should explain her plans to graduate early and the potential impact it may have on her role as a senior class senator. Grace should express her passion for the organization and her desire to continue contributing in a meaningful way. Together, they can brainstorm potential solutions, such as finding a replacement for her seat in the spring or adjusting her responsibilities to accommodate her early graduation. By being transparent and proactive, Grace can work towards a solution that benefits both her and the student government.
