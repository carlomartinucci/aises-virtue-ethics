I would thank the donor for their interest in supporting the university and for their willingness to make a donation. I would express gratitude for their desire to give back to the community. I would then inform the donor that the university values transparency and ethical considerations in all donations received. Given the history of the financial group they were associated with, I would explain that the university has a thorough due diligence process for accepting donations to ensure alignment with the university's values and mission.

I would kindly request more information from the donor about their specific role and tenure at the financial group to better understand their individual involvement and values. I would also inquire about their motivations for supporting the university and their views on ethical practices in business.

Based on the information provided by the donor and after internal discussions with the university's leadership and ethics committee, I would make a decision on whether to accept the donation. If the donor's personal values and actions align with the university's commitment to diversity, inclusion, and ethical practices, I would proceed with accepting the donation and express appreciation for their support. If there are concerns about the donor's past actions or values conflicting with the university's principles, I would politely decline the donation while thanking the donor for their interest in supporting the university.
