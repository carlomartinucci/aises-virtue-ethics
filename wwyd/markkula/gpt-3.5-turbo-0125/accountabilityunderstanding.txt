I would schedule a one-on-one meeting with Jamie to discuss his recent behavior and absences. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about his lack of attendance and communication, and the impact it is having on the rest of the executive council and the initiatives being implemented. I would listen to Jamie's perspective on the situation, including any challenges he may be facing with his classes and other responsibilities.

I would then work with Jamie to come up with a plan to address the issues, which may include setting specific attendance and communication expectations, providing additional support or resources if needed, and establishing consequences for continued non-compliance. I would emphasize the importance of accountability within the student government and the need for all council members to fulfill their commitments.

Ultimately, I would aim to strike a balance between holding Jamie accountable for his responsibilities while also showing understanding and support for the challenges he may be facing. By addressing the issue directly and collaboratively with Jamie, I would work towards finding a solution that benefits both him and the student government as a whole.
