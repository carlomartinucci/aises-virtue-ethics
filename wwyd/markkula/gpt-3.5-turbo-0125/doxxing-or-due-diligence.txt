I would advise Andres to respect the student's request for anonymity in the article. Given that the student is facing social backlash and fears further ostracization, it is important to prioritize his well-being and protect him from potential harm. By honoring his wish to remain anonymous, Andres can uphold ethical journalism standards that prioritize the safety and dignity of vulnerable sources. Additionally, Andres can still report on the student's motives and criticisms without compromising his identity, thus striking a balance between transparency and protecting the student from undue harm.
