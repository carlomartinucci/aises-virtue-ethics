I would thank the donor for their interest in supporting the university and for their willingness to make a donation. I would express gratitude for their desire to give back to the community. 

Given the donor's association with the financial group that engaged in predatory lending practices, I would acknowledge the concerns raised by their past actions. I would inform the donor that the university takes ethical considerations seriously, especially when it comes to the source of donations. 

I would explain that the university has a commitment to upholding ethical standards and ensuring that donations come from sources that align with the university's values, including a commitment to diversity and inclusion in STEM education. I would kindly request more information from the donor about their specific role and involvement during their time at the financial group, to better understand their perspective and intentions.

I would then consult with the university's fundraising team and leadership to discuss the situation further and determine the appropriate course of action. This may involve conducting due diligence on the donor's background, seeking advice from the university's ethics committee, or engaging in a dialogue with the donor to address any concerns and clarify expectations regarding their donations.
