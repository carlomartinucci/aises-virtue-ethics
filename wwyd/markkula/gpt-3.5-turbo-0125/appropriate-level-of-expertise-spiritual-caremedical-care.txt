I would express my deep concern for John's well-being and emphasize the importance of seeking professional help. I would offer to accompany him to an appointment with a mental health professional or a substance abuse counselor to provide support and encouragement. I would also reach out to other church members who may have experience in these areas and could offer additional assistance or resources. Additionally, I would continue to pray with John and provide spiritual guidance while actively encouraging him to prioritize his physical and mental health by seeking appropriate professional help.
