In this situation, Drake should prioritize fairness and impartiality in the funding process. To maintain integrity and avoid any appearance of favoritism, Drake should politely decline Alex's request to review the funding proposal personally. Instead, Drake should encourage Alex to utilize the online resources and tip guides provided by Associated Students to ensure that all student organizations have equal access to guidance and support in the funding process. Drake can offer to answer any general questions Alex may have about the process or provide clarification on any guidelines.

Additionally, Drake should communicate to Alex the importance of following the established procedures and guidelines to ensure a fair and transparent evaluation of all funding proposals. By upholding the principles of fairness and impartiality, Drake can demonstrate his commitment to ethical conduct in his role as Finance Commissioner and maintain the trust of all student organizations involved in the funding process.
