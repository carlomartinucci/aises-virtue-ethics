I would have a detailed discussion with the patient about the legal implications of her drug use during pregnancy, including the mandatory reporting requirements in our state. I would explain the potential consequences of reporting, such as access to immediate inpatient drug treatment but also the risk of a criminal record or involvement with child protective services.

I would then explore alternative options with the patient, such as seeking voluntary treatment programs that provide support for pregnant women with substance use disorders. I would emphasize the importance of her commitment to becoming drug-free for the well-being of her fetus and offer to connect her with resources and support services that can help her achieve that goal.

I would also discuss the importance of prenatal care and monitoring for both her and the baby's health throughout the pregnancy, regardless of her decision regarding treatment options. I would ensure that she understands the potential risks of continued heroin use during pregnancy and the benefits of seeking help.

Ultimately, I would respect her autonomy and decision-making process while providing her with all the necessary information and support to make an informed choice about her treatment options.
