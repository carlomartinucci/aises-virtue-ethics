I would advise Nadia to disclose her involvement in the student organization dedicated to social activism and service learning in her article about the protest. By being transparent about her connections to the organization, Nadia can maintain her credibility as a fair and objective reporter. This disclosure will help readers understand her perspective and potential biases, allowing them to interpret the information presented in the article more critically. Additionally, I would suggest that Nadia actively seek out diverse perspectives on the issue, including those who may have different viewpoints or experiences related to the working conditions of the custodial staff. This will help ensure that her reporting is balanced and comprehensive.
