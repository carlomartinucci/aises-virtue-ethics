I would immediately address the situation by advocating for Michelle's needs. I would speak to the physician and clinic management to emphasize the importance of providing accessible equipment for patients with disabilities. I would request that appropriate accommodations be made for Michelle, such as ensuring there is staff available to assist her onto the exam table or providing alternative examination methods that can be done while she remains in her wheelchair. I would also recommend additional training for the physician in treating patients with mobility disabilities to prevent similar incidents in the future. Finally, I would work with the clinic to develop a plan to prevent such oversights and ensure that all patients receive the necessary care regardless of their physical abilities.
