I would immediately raise concerns within the company about the ethical implications of the clinical trial conducted in Russia. I would advocate for a thorough review of the informed consent process used in the trial to ensure that it met the necessary ethical standards. I would recommend that the company establish a plan to provide ongoing access to the drug and medical care for the trial participants in Russia, even after the trial has ended. Additionally, I would suggest that the company consider ways to make the drug more affordable for those who participated in the trial and may benefit from continued treatment.
