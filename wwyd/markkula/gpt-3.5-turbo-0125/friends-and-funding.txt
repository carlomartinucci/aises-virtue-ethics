I would advise Angela to recuse herself from voting on the funding requests for the campus organizations, including the Hawaiian cultural club's luau event. By stepping back from the decision-making process, Angela can avoid any potential conflict of interest and ensure that the funding allocation is fair and impartial. Additionally, I would suggest that Angela communicate her decision to recuse herself to the rest of the student senate, explaining the reason behind her choice to uphold transparency and integrity in the decision-making process.
