I would suggest that Carlos explore alternative funding options for the retreat before making a decision. He could consider reaching out to potential sponsors or donors who may be willing to contribute to the cost of the retreat in exchange for recognition or other benefits. Additionally, he could look into organizing a fundraising event specifically for the retreat to help cover the increased cost. By actively seeking out additional sources of funding, Carlos may be able to preserve the budget for student government programs while still being able to hold the important retreat.
