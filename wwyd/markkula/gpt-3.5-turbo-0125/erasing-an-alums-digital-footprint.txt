I would advise Marcus to have a candid conversation with Analyssa, the school editor, to discuss the potential implications of redacting his name from the article. During this conversation, Marcus should express his concerns about how the article could impact his current job search and future employment opportunities. He should also acknowledge the importance of transparency and the public interest in accessible information.

To address Analyssa's concerns about setting a problematic precedent, Marcus could propose a compromise. For example, he could suggest adding a note to the article explaining the context of the incident and how he has grown and matured since then. This way, the information remains accessible to the public, but readers are also provided with additional context to consider.

Ultimately, the goal of the conversation should be to find a solution that balances Marcus's need to protect his reputation with the school paper's commitment to transparency and accountability. By engaging in an open dialogue with Analyssa, Marcus can work towards a resolution that addresses his concerns while also upholding the values of the school paper.
