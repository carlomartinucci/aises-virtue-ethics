In this scenario, I would first assess the potential impact of the vulnerabilities on users and systems. I would then communicate with both Google and Microsoft to understand their perspectives and the status of the vulnerabilities. Next, I would work to facilitate a dialogue between the two companies to encourage collaboration in addressing the vulnerabilities and finding a resolution that prioritizes user safety and security. Additionally, I would explore the possibility of involving relevant cybersecurity experts or industry stakeholders to provide insights and guidance on the best course of action.
