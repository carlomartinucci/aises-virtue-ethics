If I were in Miguel's shoes, I would step down from my position in the outdoor club for the time being in order to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. This would allow me to focus on my role in Associated Students and fulfill my duties without any concerns about bias or favoritism. I would communicate openly and honestly with the club members about my decision, explaining that it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the petitioning process and my position in student government. I would assure them that stepping down temporarily does not diminish my support for the club's goals and activities, and that I look forward to potentially rejoining in the future once the petitioning process is complete.
