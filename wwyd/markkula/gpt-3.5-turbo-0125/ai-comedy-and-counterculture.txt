I would reach out to the George Carlin estate and Carlin's daughter to offer my assistance in ensuring that any AI-generated content featuring Carlin's likeness or voice in the future is done with proper authorization and respect for his legacy. I would propose collaborating on developing guidelines or protocols for using AI technology to recreate deceased artists' works, with a focus on obtaining consent from the artists' families or estates. Additionally, I would suggest exploring the possibility of creating a legal framework or industry standards to address the ethical implications of AI-generated content in the entertainment industry.
