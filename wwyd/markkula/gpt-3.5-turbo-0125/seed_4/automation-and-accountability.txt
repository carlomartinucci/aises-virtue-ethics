I would work to support the impacted residents by connecting them with legal aid organizations that specialize in cases involving wrongful accusations of fraud. I would help them navigate the legal system, understand their rights, and explore options for financial relief or compensation. Additionally, I would assist them in gathering evidence and documentation to strengthen their case, and provide emotional support during what is likely a challenging and distressing time for them.
