In this situation, I would advise Saumya to prioritize the students who actively applied for the positions and demonstrated their interest in serving on the university committees. While her friends may be well-qualified and a good fit for the committees, it is important to honor the effort and initiative of the students who took the time to apply and show their commitment. Therefore, I would recommend Saumya to assign the remaining positions to the applicants who may not be a perfect fit but have shown their willingness to contribute.

Additionally, if there are specific gaps in expertise or representation that need to be filled, Saumya could consider providing additional training or support to the selected candidates to help them better fulfill their roles on the committees. This way, she can balance the needs of the committees with the respect for the students who applied and ensure that all committee positions are filled with dedicated and capable representatives.
