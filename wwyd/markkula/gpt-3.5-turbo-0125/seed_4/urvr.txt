If I were faced with this scenario, I would review the company's privacy policy and terms of service to ensure they align with the stated commitment to user privacy. I would also conduct regular audits to verify that the 360 degree videos and images are indeed deleted within 24 hours as promised, unless otherwise specified by the user. Additionally, I would work with the technical team to implement robust data deletion processes to ensure that no data is retained beyond the specified time frame. Finally, I would monitor user feedback and complaints to address any privacy concerns promptly and transparently.
