I would recommend that Tyler schedule a meeting with the other Senators on the University Affairs Committee to discuss his concerns about balancing committee work with connecting with his constituents. During the meeting, Tyler can propose reallocating some of the committee's resources or time to specifically address the issues faced by juniors returning from a semester abroad. By framing the proposal as a way to better serve the student body, Tyler can demonstrate his dedication to representing their changing needs while still fulfilling his responsibilities on the committee.

Additionally, I would suggest that Tyler reach out to juniors who have returned from a semester abroad to listen to their experiences and gather feedback on how the university can better support them. This direct engagement with his constituents will not only help Tyler understand their needs better but also demonstrate his commitment to advocating for their interests.

Furthermore, I would advise Tyler to communicate his intentions and actions transparently with his fellow Senators and seek their support in prioritizing connecting with constituents alongside committee projects. By involving his peers in the decision-making process and highlighting the importance of community engagement, Tyler can build stronger relationships within the Senate and demonstrate his leadership skills in balancing competing priorities.
