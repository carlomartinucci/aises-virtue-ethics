I would schedule a meeting with key stakeholders, including student leaders, faculty members, and administrators, to discuss the situation. During the meeting, I would explain the concerns about email volume and the potential impact on student engagement if the list were to be opened up to faculty members. I would propose a compromise solution where faculty members could submit their information to be included in the weekly email newsletter, ensuring that important information reaches students without overwhelming them with additional emails. I would also suggest exploring alternative communication channels for faculty members to reach students, such as utilizing the university website or social media platforms. By bringing all parties to the table and fostering open communication, I aim to find a solution that balances the needs of students, faculty, and student organizations while maintaining the integrity of the email list system.
