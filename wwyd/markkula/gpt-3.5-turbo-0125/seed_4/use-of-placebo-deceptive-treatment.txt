I would schedule a dedicated appointment with the patient to discuss his concerns about contracting syphilis. During this appointment, I would calmly and empathetically explore his fears and beliefs about the situation. I would validate his feelings and provide clear and accurate information about the results of his tests showing no evidence of syphilis. I would also inquire further about his recent sexual history and any potential sources of misinformation or misunderstandings.

Additionally, I would collaborate with other healthcare professionals involved in his care, such as infectious disease specialists or primary care physicians, to gather more information and support in addressing the patient's concerns. I would aim to provide a unified and consistent message across all healthcare providers involved in his care to prevent further confusion or mistrust.

Finally, I would adjust my treatment approach to address the patient's distress and mistrust, potentially by involving a therapist or counselor to help him process his emotions and thoughts more effectively. It is crucial to maintain a therapeutic alliance with the patient to ensure his ongoing engagement with psychiatric treatment.
