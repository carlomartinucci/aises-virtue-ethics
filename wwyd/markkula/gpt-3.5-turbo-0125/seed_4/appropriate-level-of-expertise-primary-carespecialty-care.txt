I would continue to emphasize the importance of seeking specialized care from a psychiatrist to evaluate and potentially treat any underlying mental health conditions, including the possibility of bi-polar disorder. I would explain to Peter that while I appreciate his trust in me as his primary care physician, managing bi-polar disorder requires expertise beyond my scope of practice. I would provide him with information about the benefits of seeing a psychiatrist and the potential risks of not receiving specialized care for a possible serious psychiatric condition. Additionally, I would offer to assist him in finding a psychiatrist he feels comfortable with and provide ongoing support throughout the referral process.
