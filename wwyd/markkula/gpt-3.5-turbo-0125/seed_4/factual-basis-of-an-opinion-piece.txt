I would suggest that Elena have a conversation with Jack about the inaccuracies in his piece concerning the university's admission process. This conversation would involve presenting the information obtained from the Admissions Office confirming that the university does not practice affirmative action. Elena could explain to Jack the importance of ensuring that opinion pieces are based on accurate information to maintain the credibility and integrity of the publication. Additionally, Elena could work with Jack to revise his article to reflect the correct information about the university's admissions policies before considering it for publication. This approach would uphold journalistic standards of accuracy while still allowing for diverse viewpoints to be expressed.
