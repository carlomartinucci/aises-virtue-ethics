In Olivia's position, I would first seek advice from a trusted mentor or advisor within the university's administration. I would explain the situation honestly and ask for their perspective on whether my actions could be perceived as unfair or unethical. Additionally, I would consult the university's code of conduct or any relevant guidelines to ensure that I am not violating any rules or policies.

If after these consultations, it is determined that my actions could potentially be seen as unfair or unethical, I would consider adjusting my approach. This could involve making the election timeline public earlier than planned, sharing my campaign intentions with the rest of the ASI executive team, or reevaluating the timing of the events in relation to the election period.

Ultimately, I would prioritize transparency and integrity in my actions, ensuring that my campaign preparations align with ethical standards and do not compromise the integrity of the election process.
