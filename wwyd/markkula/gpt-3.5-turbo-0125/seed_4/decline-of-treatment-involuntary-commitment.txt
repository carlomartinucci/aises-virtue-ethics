I would first ensure that Julia is in a safe environment by removing the unopened bottle of powerful pain medication from her possession. I would then have a private conversation with Julia to build rapport and trust, emphasizing that my primary goal is to support her well-being. I would listen actively to her concerns about past treatments for depression causing adverse effects and validate her feelings.

Next, I would conduct a thorough assessment of her current mental health status, including any immediate risk of harm to herself. I would ask specific and direct questions about suicidal thoughts and intentions, ensuring clarity in communication. If there are any indications of imminent harm, I would take immediate steps to ensure her safety, which may include involving emergency services or hospitalization.

Given Julia's reluctance to involve her parents or commit to seeing her regular doctor, I would respect her autonomy as an adult while also explaining the importance of having a support system in place. I would encourage her to consider involving trusted individuals in her treatment journey, emphasizing the benefits of having a strong network of support.

Furthermore, I would explore alternative treatment options with Julia, taking into account her past experiences with negative side effects. I would discuss the possibility of therapy, medication adjustments, or other forms of support that could help alleviate her symptoms. It is crucial to collaborate with Julia in creating a treatment plan that she feels comfortable with and that addresses her unique needs and concerns.

Throughout the interaction, I would maintain a non-judgmental and empathetic attitude, validating Julia's experiences and emotions. Building a therapeutic alliance based on trust and mutual respect is essential in helping her navigate her mental health challenges effectively.
