I would advise Grace to have an open and honest conversation with the senior members of the student government about her situation. She should explain her plans to graduate early and express her passion for the organization and desire to continue contributing. Grace could propose potential solutions, such as finding a replacement for her position in the spring quarter or working closely with the incoming senator to ensure a smooth transition. By being transparent and proactive, Grace can work towards a resolution that benefits both her and the student government.
