In this situation, Bruce should first prioritize the well-being and inclusivity of all individuals involved, including both employees and students. He should have a conversation with Spencer to fully understand the specific needs and accommodations required for the emotional support animal. Bruce should also consult with human resources and legal counsel to ensure compliance with California state laws regarding emotional support animals in the workplace.

After gathering all necessary information, Bruce should assess the feasibility of accommodating Spencer's needs within the organization. He should consider the potential impact on other staff and students, such as allergies or fears of dogs, and work towards finding a solution that balances the needs of all parties involved.

Bruce should also consider the financial implications of accommodating Spencer, taking into account the organization's current financial situation. If accommodating Spencer would create undue financial hardship for the organization, Bruce should explore alternative solutions with Spencer that could meet his needs while also being feasible for the organization.

Ultimately, Bruce should make a decision based on a careful consideration of all factors, ensuring that he acts in a fair and inclusive manner while also taking into account the organization's financial constraints and operational needs.
