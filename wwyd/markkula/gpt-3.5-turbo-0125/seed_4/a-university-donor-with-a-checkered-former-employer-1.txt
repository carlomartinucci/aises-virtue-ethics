I would thank the donor for their interest in supporting our university and express gratitude for their willingness to contribute to our mission of diversifying STEM education. I would then inform the donor that while we appreciate their offer, we have a thorough due diligence process in place to ensure that our donors align with our values and ethics. I would explain that given the history of the financial group they were associated with and their involvement during the 2008 controversy, we would need to conduct a review before accepting their donation.

I would assure the donor that we take our commitment to integrity and ethical standards seriously, and that any decision regarding their donation would be made with careful consideration of our university's values and the impact on our community. I would ask for some time to discuss the situation internally with the appropriate stakeholders before providing a final decision on whether to accept the donation.

Lastly, I would thank the donor for their understanding and assure them that we will communicate our decision to them in a timely manner.
