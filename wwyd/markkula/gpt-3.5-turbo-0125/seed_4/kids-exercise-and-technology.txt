I would raise concerns about the potential negative impact on children's mental health and self-esteem caused by the watch's design features. Specifically, I would recommend conducting a thorough review of the product's psychological implications, especially regarding the use of a virtual character whose emotions are tied to the user's activity levels. Additionally, I would suggest consulting child psychologists and experts in child development to determine the potential risks associated with gamifying exercise and setting up such a reward system that could lead to feelings of guilt or failure in children if they are unable to meet their daily goals. It is crucial to prioritize the well-being of children and ensure that any product designed for them promotes positive behaviors and healthy relationships with physical activity.
