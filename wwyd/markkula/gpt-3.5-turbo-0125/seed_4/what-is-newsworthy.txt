I would recommend that Fatimah consult with her editor or another senior staff member at the school newspaper to discuss her concerns about tweeting campus safety reports. Together, they can review the paper's editorial guidelines and policies to determine whether sharing these reports aligns with the publication's values and journalistic standards. They can also consider the potential impact of such tweets on the reputation of the paper and the well-being of the individuals involved in the incidents. If necessary, they can seek input from the campus community or relevant authorities to gather different perspectives on the matter before making a decision on whether to continue tweeting campus safety reports.
