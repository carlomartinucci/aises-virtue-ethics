I would arrange a meeting with Kyle's parents, the doctor, and a representative from Eminent Scholars to address their concerns and discuss potential solutions. During the meeting, I would propose a plan that combines the personalized learning approach of Eminent Scholars with supplemental social skills development sessions to ensure Kyle has opportunities to work on teamwork, communication, and social interaction. This could involve incorporating group activities, peer tutoring, or social skills workshops into Kyle's schedule to provide him with a well-rounded educational experience that addresses both his academic strengths and social challenges. I would also offer to connect Kyle's parents with other families who have enrolled their children at Eminent Scholars to hear about their experiences firsthand and alleviate any concerns about potential isolation.
