I would assure Alexandra that I understand her concerns about privacy and the potential repercussions of being identified in the article. I would explain to her that I prioritize her safety and well-being, and that I will respect her wish to have her name redacted from the article. I would also inform her that I will take measures to protect her identity throughout the writing and publishing process. Additionally, I would discuss with Alexandra the option of using a pseudonym to further safeguard her anonymity while still sharing her story.
