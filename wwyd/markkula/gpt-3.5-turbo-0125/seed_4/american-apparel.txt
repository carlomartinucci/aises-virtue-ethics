I would first review American Apparel's code of conduct and sexual harassment policies to understand the company's stance on such behavior. Then, I would conduct an internal investigation to gather more information about the specific instances of misconduct involving Dov Charney and determine the impact of his behavior on the company's culture and reputation. Based on the findings, I would work with HR and legal teams to take appropriate disciplinary actions, which may include termination or suspension, depending on the severity of the violations. Additionally, I would communicate transparently with employees, stakeholders, and the public to address the situation and reassure them of the company's commitment to maintaining a safe and respectful work environment.
