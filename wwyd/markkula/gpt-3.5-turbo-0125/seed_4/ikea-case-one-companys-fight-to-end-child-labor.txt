I would work with the relevant departments within IKEA to develop a comprehensive plan to address and eliminate child labor from its supply chain in India. This plan would involve conducting thorough audits of all suppliers in India to identify any instances of child labor, implementing strict policies and procedures to ensure compliance with India's Child Labor Act, providing support and resources to help suppliers transition away from child labor, and establishing a monitoring system to continuously assess and improve the working conditions in the supply chain. Additionally, I would collaborate with local organizations and experts in India to gain insights and guidance on effectively tackling child labor issues in the region.
