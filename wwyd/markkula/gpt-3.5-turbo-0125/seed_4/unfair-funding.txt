I would suggest that Claire holds a meeting with the entire funding committee to discuss the issue openly and transparently. During the meeting, Claire should present the data showing the discrepancy in funding allocations and express her concerns about the potential bias towards Garret's club. She should encourage an open dialogue among committee members to gather their perspectives and insights on the matter.

Furthermore, I would advise Claire to propose implementing a rotation system where committee members are assigned to review funding requests from clubs other than their own. This way, the decision-making process becomes more impartial and reduces the likelihood of any perceived bias towards specific clubs.

Additionally, Claire could suggest establishing clear and objective criteria for evaluating funding requests to ensure fairness and consistency in decision-making. This would help mitigate any potential favoritism towards certain clubs and promote a more equitable distribution of funds across all student organizations.

By addressing the issue openly with the committee members, implementing a rotation system, and establishing clear evaluation criteria, Claire can work towards creating a more transparent and fair funding allocation process within the student government.
