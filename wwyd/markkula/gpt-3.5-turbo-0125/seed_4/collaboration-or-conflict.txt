In this situation, I would recommend that Josh schedule a face-to-face meeting with Alanna to discuss the concerns and issues surrounding the upcoming fair. During the meeting, Josh should express his appreciation for the longstanding collaboration between student government and RHA, and communicate his concerns about the current lack of communication and cooperation.

Josh should then propose a clear timeline and plan of action for moving forward with the event, highlighting the importance of working together to ensure its success. He should also address any specific concerns or reservations that Alanna may have and seek to find common ground in order to move forward collaboratively.

If Alanna remains unresponsive or unwilling to engage constructively, Josh could consider involving a neutral mediator, such as a faculty advisor or a representative from the university administration, to help facilitate communication and decision-making between student government and RHA.

Ultimately, the goal should be to find a solution that preserves the positive relationship between the two organizations while also ensuring the successful planning and execution of the fair for the benefit of the student body.
