In this scenario, I would first thank the donor for their interest in supporting the university and its mission. I would then express appreciation for their willingness to contribute to the expansion of STEM education and the goal of increasing diversity in the field.

Given the donor's association with a financial group known for past predatory lending practices, I would acknowledge the history of the financial group and the concerns it raised in the past. However, since the donor was retired before the controversies arose and is expressing a genuine desire to give back to the community through donations, I would not immediately reject the donation offer.

I would take the opportunity to have a candid conversation with the donor about the university's commitment to ethical practices, diversity, and inclusion. I would explain the importance of upholding these values and how the university is working towards creating a more equitable environment for all students, including those from historically underrepresented backgrounds.

During the conversation, I would also inquire about the donor's motivation for supporting the university and gaining a better understanding of their values and intentions. I would emphasize the importance of transparency and accountability in all donations received by the university.

Ultimately, I would consult with the university's leadership, including the fundraising team and relevant stakeholders, to discuss the situation and decide on the best course of action. This may involve conducting further due diligence on the donor's background and intentions, as well as determining how accepting the donation aligns with the university's mission and values.
