I would advise Tim to firmly refuse the bribe offered by Sam. Tim should explain that accepting the cash is unethical, illegal, and could have severe consequences for both of them, including criminal charges and reputational damage. Tim should emphasize that his integrity and the integrity of the deal are paramount, and any actions that compromise that integrity are not acceptable. Tim should document the encounter and the attempted bribe, and report the incident to his own company's compliance and legal departments, as well as to the appropriate regulatory authorities if necessary. Tim should also seek guidance from a trusted mentor or advisor within the company to navigate the situation and potentially mitigate any negative repercussions on his career.
