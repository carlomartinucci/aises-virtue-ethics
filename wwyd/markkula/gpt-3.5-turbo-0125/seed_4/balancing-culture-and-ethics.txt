I would advise Ben to express his concerns about child labor to JP and the villagers in a respectful and diplomatic manner. Ben could acknowledge the positive aspects of the business development, such as the additional income it provides for the families, but also highlight the potential risks and negative impacts of child labor on the children's well-being. Ben could suggest exploring alternative ways to support the families economically that do not involve child labor, such as providing education and training opportunities for both children and adults in the village. It is important for Ben to approach this sensitive topic with empathy and understanding for the villagers' perspective while advocating for the protection and welfare of the children involved.
