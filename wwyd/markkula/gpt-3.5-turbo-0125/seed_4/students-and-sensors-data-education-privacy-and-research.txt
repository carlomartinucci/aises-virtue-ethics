I would ensure that the use of student data for improving student retention or academic success is conducted with full transparency and accountability. This includes informing students about the specific types of data being collected, how it will be used, and who will have access to it. I would also advocate for clear policies and procedures regarding the handling of student data, ensuring that data is anonymized to protect student privacy to the greatest extent possible. Additionally, I would support the establishment of mechanisms for students to review and challenge any assessments made based on their data, as well as providing them with the option to opt out of certain data collection processes if they so choose.
