I would advise the city leaders to carefully review the proposal from the technology company and consider the potential privacy implications of granting access to the video recordings. I would recommend that they consult with legal experts to ensure that the use of emotion-recognition AI complies with existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and surveillance. Additionally, I would suggest that city leaders engage in transparent communication with the public about the proposed use of the technology, seeking feedback and addressing any concerns raised by community members.
