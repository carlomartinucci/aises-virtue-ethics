I would advise Derek to consider organizing a town hall meeting or forum specifically dedicated to addressing the concerns of students involved in off-campus Greek life. This would provide a platform for these students to openly share their experiences and perspectives on the recent targeted thefts. Derek can invite the Vice Provost to attend and listen to the students directly, allowing her to understand the gravity of the situation from a student's point of view.

Additionally, Derek could collaborate with other student government leaders to gather data and evidence related to the thefts, presenting a compelling case for the Vice Provost to reconsider her stance on discussing Greek life issues. By approaching the situation with concrete information and a platform for open dialogue, Derek can work towards bridging the gap between the students' concerns and the administration's limitations, ultimately fostering a more transparent and supportive relationship between both parties.
