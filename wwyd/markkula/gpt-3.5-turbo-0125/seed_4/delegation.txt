I would schedule a meeting with my student staff to discuss workload distribution and assess their current tasks and responsibilities. During the meeting, I would openly communicate my concerns about potentially overloading them and inquire about their workload capacity and stress levels. I would also seek their feedback on how they are managing their tasks and if they feel capable of handling the responsibilities that have been delegated to them, especially in my absence.

Based on the feedback received, I would work collaboratively with my student staff to prioritize tasks and redistribute responsibilities more equitably. I would ensure that each team member has a manageable workload that aligns with their capabilities and availability. If necessary, I would explore options such as adjusting deadlines, reassigning tasks, or providing additional support and resources to help them fulfill their responsibilities effectively.

Additionally, I would evaluate the importance and impact of my state-level duties advocating for student financial aid and government funding. I would consider the potential consequences of neglecting these responsibilities and assess how critical they are to the overall well-being of the student body. Based on this assessment, I would make an informed decision on whether to reallocate some of my time and focus back to these state-level tasks while still maintaining a balanced approach to neighborhood relations.

Overall, my priority would be to ensure the well-being and effectiveness of my student staff while also fulfilling the essential duties of my role to best serve the university community as a whole.
