I would thank the donor for her generous offer and express gratitude for her desire to support the shelter's mission of helping families experiencing homelessness. I would assure her that her anonymity will be respected as requested.

Given the circumstances of the donor's past involvement in a corporate embezzlement scam and pending trial, I would inform her that the organization has a responsibility to conduct due diligence on all donations received, including large gifts. I would explain that this is a standard procedure to ensure that all donations are received ethically and in accordance with the organization's values.

I would request additional information from the donor, such as the source of the funds and any legal implications that may arise from accepting the donation. I would also inquire if there are any conditions attached to the gift that the organization needs to be aware of.

I would communicate with the executive director and board of directors to discuss the situation and seek their guidance on how to proceed. It may be necessary to consult with legal counsel to ensure that accepting the donation does not pose any legal risks to the organization.

Ultimately, I would prioritize the best interests of the families served by the shelter and the integrity of the organization in deciding whether to accept the donation.
