I would first meet with the two senators individually to discuss potential solutions. For the senior senator, I would explore the possibility of petitioning the professor of the class to see if there is any flexibility in attendance requirements given the circumstances. I would also help the senior senator identify alternative ways to stay engaged with Senate activities, such as providing input on agenda items ahead of time or participating in discussions through written communication.

For the junior senator, I would work with them to identify a trusted proxy who can attend Senate meetings on their behalf and report back to them on discussions and decisions made. I would ensure that the proxy is briefed on key issues and empowered to represent the junior senator's views accurately.

Additionally, I would propose implementing a system where senators are allowed to participate remotely in Senate meetings through video conferencing or other technology if they are unable to attend in person due to class conflicts. This would ensure that all senators can continue to fulfill their duties even if they are unable to physically be present.

Finally, I would communicate with the rest of the Senate members about the unique challenges faced by these two senators and seek their understanding and support for the proposed solutions. It is important to emphasize the commitment and dedication of the senators in question and the efforts being made to ensure their continued participation in Senate activities.
