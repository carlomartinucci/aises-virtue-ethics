I would schedule individual meetings with each board member to understand their perspectives, motivations, and level of commitment to the organization. During these meetings, I would communicate the vision for the nonprofit's future growth and the need for active board engagement to achieve those goals. I would seek input on how to increase board involvement and address any potential concerns or barriers they may have. Additionally, I would explore opportunities for board training or education to enhance their understanding of their roles and responsibilities in fundraising and strategic planning. Finally, I would work with the board chair to establish clear expectations for board member participation and set measurable goals for board engagement moving forward.
