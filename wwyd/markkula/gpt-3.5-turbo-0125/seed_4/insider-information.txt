I would inform Alex that, as the Finance Commissioner, I must maintain impartiality and fairness in the funding process for all student clubs and societies. I would explain that meeting to review his proposal personally could create a conflict of interest, as it may give his club an unfair advantage over others. Instead, I would offer to answer any general questions Alex might have about the funding process or provide clarification on the guidelines available online. I would emphasize the importance of following the established procedures to ensure fairness and equal opportunities for all student organizations.
