I would express my concern for John's well-being and emphasize the importance of seeking professional help. I would offer to accompany him to an appointment with a therapist or counselor who specializes in depression and addiction. I would also encourage him to consider joining a support group specifically for individuals facing similar challenges, such as a depression support group or a group for individuals in recovery from addiction. Additionally, I would continue to provide emotional support, pray with him, and check in regularly to see how he is coping.
