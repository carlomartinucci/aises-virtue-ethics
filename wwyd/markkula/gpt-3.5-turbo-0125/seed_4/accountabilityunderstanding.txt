As Margaret, I would schedule a one-on-one meeting with Jamie to discuss his recent behavior and absences. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about his inconsistent attendance and lack of communication, emphasizing the impact it has on the rest of the executive council and the initiatives they are working on. I would also acknowledge that I understand he has been facing challenges with his classes and other responsibilities at the university.

I would listen to Jamie's perspective and ask him to provide insights into how he believes he can better fulfill his responsibilities despite his current challenges. I would work with him to come up with a plan to address his attendance and communication issues, setting clear expectations and deadlines for improvement. I would also offer support and resources to help him manage his workload more effectively.

If Jamie continues to struggle with meeting his commitments despite our discussions and the agreed-upon plan, I would have to consider implementing a more formal disciplinary action, such as reducing his responsibilities within the executive council or implementing a probationary period. However, I would continue to prioritize open communication and understanding while also holding him accountable for his commitments to the student government.
