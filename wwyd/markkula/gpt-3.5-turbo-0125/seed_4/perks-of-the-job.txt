I would schedule a private meeting with Julia to discuss the issue. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about the misuse of office resources for personal gain and how it impacts the organization's budget. I would mention that while I acknowledge her hard work and dedication to the organization, it is important to adhere to the rules and guidelines set in place for the proper use of resources. I would suggest finding alternative solutions or compromises that could address both her needs and the organization's budget concerns. Finally, I would emphasize the importance of transparency and accountability in upholding the integrity of the student government.
