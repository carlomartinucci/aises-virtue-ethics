In Talia's position, I would schedule a meeting with the university administration to discuss their concerns about the smoking ban. During the meeting, I would ask for more information and clarification on the potential legal implications and student rights issues that the administration is worried about. I would also inquire about any alternative solutions that could address both the public health concerns and the potential legal issues.

After gathering more information from the administration, I would hold a town hall meeting with my sophomore constituents to present the administration's concerns and the information I gathered from them. I would facilitate a discussion to get feedback from the students on their thoughts and opinions regarding the smoking ban and the concerns raised by the administration.

Based on the feedback received from the town hall meeting and considering the legal implications presented by the administration, I would make an informed decision on whether to vote for or against the smoking ban. I would prioritize the well-being and rights of all students while also considering the wishes of my constituency.
