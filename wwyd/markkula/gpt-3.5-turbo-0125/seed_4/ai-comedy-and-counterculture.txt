I would reach out to Carlin's daughter to express my understanding of her concerns and to open up a dialogue about the impact of AI technologies on the legacy of artists. I would offer to collaborate on creating guidelines or safeguards to ensure that similar situations can be prevented in the future, taking into account the ethical implications and the importance of respecting the artistic integrity and legacy of deceased artists like George Carlin. Additionally, I would suggest creating a platform for artists and their families to have more control over how their likeness, voice, and work are used in AI-generated content to protect their legacy and prevent unauthorized exploitation.
