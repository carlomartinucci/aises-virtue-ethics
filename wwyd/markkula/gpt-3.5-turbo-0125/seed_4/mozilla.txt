I would acknowledge Brendan Eich's decision to resign as CEO of Mozilla and respect his choice to step down in light of the controversy surrounding his previous political support for the Defense of Marriage Act. I would ensure that the transition of leadership is handled smoothly and effectively, working with the board and relevant stakeholders to appoint an interim CEO or begin the search for a new CEO who aligns with the organization's values and mission. Additionally, I would communicate openly and transparently with employees, contributors, and users of Mozilla to address any concerns or questions they may have about the situation and reassure them of the organization's commitment to its mission and values.
