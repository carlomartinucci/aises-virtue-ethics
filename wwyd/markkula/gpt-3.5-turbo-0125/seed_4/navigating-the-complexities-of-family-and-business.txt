Given the scenario, I would suggest that Mary proceed by first trying to have a candid conversation with her brother, Donald, to discuss the different viewpoints and concerns each of them has regarding the future of the family business. 

During this conversation, Mary should try to emphasize the importance of finding a solution that not only respects their individual financial interests but also considers the legacy of the family business that has been passed down through generations. Mary could propose a compromise solution, such as exploring the option of hiring external professionals to manage the business temporarily while actively seeking new tenants for the building. This approach could potentially maintain the long-term value of the business while also addressing Donald's desire to disengage from the complexities of the business.

Furthermore, Mary should highlight the potential negative impact of selling the building, such as the significant tax burden and the loss of a valuable asset that has provided stability for their family in the past. By presenting a detailed analysis of the financial implications of selling versus retaining the business, Mary can demonstrate the potential risks and benefits of each option.

Lastly, Mary should also consider seeking advice from a financial advisor or business consultant to provide an objective assessment of the situation and offer potential solutions that align with both her financial interests and the best interests of the family business as a whole.

In conclusion, Mary should prioritize open communication, collaboration, and a focus on finding a mutually beneficial solution that considers both the financial implications and the legacy of the family business. By approaching the situation with empathy and a willingness to explore alternative solutions, Mary can navigate the complex dynamics within the family business while upholding her ethical duty to act in the best interests of all shareholders.
