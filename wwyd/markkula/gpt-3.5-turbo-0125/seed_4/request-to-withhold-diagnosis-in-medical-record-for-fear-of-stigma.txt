I would start by expressing empathy and validating Sophie's feelings of distress. I would then explain the importance of honesty and transparency in medical records, emphasizing the potential risks of withholding information from her medical record. I would discuss the implications of not documenting her depression diagnosis and therapy referrals, including the impact on her future medical licensing applications and potential consequences of being dishonest with licensing boards.

I would recommend that Sophie consider the benefits of seeking appropriate treatment for her depression openly and honestly, as it is crucial for her own well-being and future success as a physician. I would emphasize the importance of mental health support and offer to help her find resources for therapy that may be affordable and accessible. I would reassure her that seeking help for mental health issues is a sign of strength and resilience, and that it is common for medical professionals to experience such challenges.

I would also discuss the potential benefits of disclosing her history of depression to licensing boards, highlighting the progress she has made in managing her condition and the positive steps she is taking to prioritize her mental health. I would encourage her to consider the long-term implications of dishonesty in her medical record and licensing applications, and work with her to develop a plan that prioritizes her well-being while also being mindful of her professional goals.
