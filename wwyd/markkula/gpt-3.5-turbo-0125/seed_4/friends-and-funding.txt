If I were in Angela's position, I would recuse myself from voting on the funding requests for the campus organizations. I would acknowledge the conflict of interest due to my personal relationship with Emily, the president of the Hawaiian cultural club. By recusing myself, I would ensure that the decision-making process is fair and unbiased. Additionally, I would communicate my decision to the Senate and explain the reason for my recusal in order to maintain transparency and integrity in the decision-making process.
