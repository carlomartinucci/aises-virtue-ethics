I would recommend that Carlos explore alternative funding sources for the retreat before considering pulling money from programs that directly benefit the student body. This could involve reaching out to other campus organizations or seeking sponsorships from local businesses to help cover the increased cost of the retreat. Additionally, Carlos could consider organizing fundraising events specifically for the retreat to offset the additional expenses. By exploring these options, Carlos may be able to find a solution that allows the retreat to continue without negatively impacting the programs that benefit the student body.
