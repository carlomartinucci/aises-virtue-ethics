In response to the Tay experience, I would conduct a thorough review of our social media strategy and policies. This review would include:

1. Implementing stricter controls and safeguards to prevent malicious intent from impacting our AI chatbots in the future.
2. Enhancing our monitoring system to detect inappropriate interactions early on and take immediate action.
3. Providing additional training to our development team on the ethical implications of deploying AI on social media platforms.
4. Collaborating with experts in social media ethics to better understand the risks and challenges involved.
5. Developing clear guidelines for engaging with users on social media that prioritize respect, inclusivity, and responsible use of technology.
6. Establishing a crisis communication plan to address any potential ethical issues that may arise in the future.
