Matt should privately reach out to John and express his concerns about the video. He can explain that while he understands the social norms around drinking in college, as a fellow senator, it is important to uphold a professional image and adhere to the rules, especially as a representative of the student government. Matt should offer support to John in case he needs help or advice on how to handle the situation. By addressing the issue directly with John first, Matt can try to resolve the matter internally before considering any further actions.
