In Marcus's position, I would first carefully evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of all the candidates, both the opposing candidates and the supporters who applied for positions. I would consider their qualifications, experience, skills, and potential contributions to the executive cabinet.

Next, I would prioritize the overall goals and needs of the student government organization. I would consider how each candidate could help achieve those goals and contribute to the unity and effectiveness of the cabinet.

Based on this assessment, I would then make a decision on the third appointed member of the executive cabinet. I would aim to select someone who complements the skills and qualities of the other members, creating a balanced and cohesive team.

I would also communicate openly and transparently with all candidates, explaining the rationale behind my decision and emphasizing the importance of working together for the benefit of the organization. I would address any concerns or potential resentments directly, seeking to build trust and collaboration within the executive cabinet from the outset.
