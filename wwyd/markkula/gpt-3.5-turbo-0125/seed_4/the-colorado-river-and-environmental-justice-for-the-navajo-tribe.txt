I would advocate for the inclusion of the Navajo tribe in the negotiations and decision-making processes related to the Colorado River water allocation. Specifically, I would work towards ensuring that the Navajo Nation's representatives are actively involved in discussions to address their water access issues and to secure their fair share of water resources. Additionally, I would support efforts to implement safe and reliable water sources for all members of the Navajo Nation, recognizing their historical rights and addressing the environmental injustice they face in accessing clean water.
