In response to the situation regarding the Diversity in Faces dataset released by IBM Research, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Conduct an internal review within IBM Research to assess the process and criteria used for selecting and annotating the photographs in the DiF dataset.
2. Reach out to the individuals whose photographs were included in the dataset to inform them of the situation and offer options for their photos to be removed if they wish.
3. Clearly communicate the steps IBM is taking to address the concerns raised by the public and media regarding the dataset, including transparency about data usage and removal processes.
4. Collaborate with experts in ethics and data privacy to ensure that future datasets released by IBM Research adhere to the highest standards of ethical data collection and usage.
5. Update the IBM Research website with detailed information on the dataset, its origins, and the steps taken to address privacy and consent issues.
