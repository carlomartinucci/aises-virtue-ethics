I would immediately schedule a meeting with the director of the sexual assault prevention center to discuss the issue of vague and potentially inaccessible information for neurodiverse students. During the meeting, I would present the data showing the increased vulnerability of neurodiverse students to assault and emphasize the importance of clear and specific guidelines for understanding consent. I would propose working together to revise the existing materials to include explicit examples and descriptions of consent that are universally understandable and actionable for all students, regardless of neurodiversity. Additionally, I would suggest conducting focus groups or seeking input from neurodiverse students to ensure the revised materials are effective and inclusive.
