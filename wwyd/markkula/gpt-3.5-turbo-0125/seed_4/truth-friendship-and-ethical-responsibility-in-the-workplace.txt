I would gather all the evidence and information I have about Michael's fraudulent activities, including the details of the scheme, the transactions involved, and any conversations or interactions that could shed light on the situation. I would document all this information meticulously to ensure clarity and accuracy.

Next, I would schedule a meeting with the internal investigation team or the appropriate authorities within the company to disclose everything I know about Michael's fraudulent behavior. During the meeting, I would present the evidence I have gathered and provide any additional context or insights that could help in understanding the extent of the fraud.

I would make it clear that I was not aware of Michael's actions at the time they were occurring and that I had only discovered the fraud during the transition period when taking over his sales territories. I would emphasize my commitment to upholding ethical standards and my desire to ensure that the company addresses the issue appropriately.

While I understand the complexities of the situation, including my friendship with Michael and the potential consequences for both him and myself, I believe that it is crucial to prioritize honesty, integrity, and the well-being of the company. By coming forward with the information I have, I would be fulfilling my duty as an employee and contributing to maintaining trust and accountability within the organization.
