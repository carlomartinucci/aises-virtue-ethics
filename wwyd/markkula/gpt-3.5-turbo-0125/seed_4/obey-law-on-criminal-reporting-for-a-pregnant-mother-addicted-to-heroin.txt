I would have a candid and empathetic conversation with the patient about the legal implications of her drug use during pregnancy. I would explain the state's mandatory reporting laws and the potential consequences, including the possibility of criminal charges and involvement with child protective services. I would inform her of the option to voluntarily enter a specialized inpatient drug treatment program that provides support for both her and the fetus.

I would also discuss the benefits of seeking treatment proactively, emphasizing that it could help ensure the health and well-being of her baby. I would offer to connect her with resources, such as addiction specialists, counselors, and support groups, to assist her in making an informed decision about her treatment options.

Ultimately, I would respect her autonomy and right to make decisions about her own healthcare while providing her with the necessary information and support to help her navigate this challenging situation.
