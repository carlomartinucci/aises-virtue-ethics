I would first gather the editorial staff for a meeting to discuss the situation and hear everyone's perspectives on the matter. I would encourage an open dialogue where each member can express their thoughts and concerns about the administration's request to remove the incendiary quote from the article.

Next, I would suggest reaching out to the university administration to schedule a meeting to further discuss the issue. During the meeting, I would emphasize the importance of journalistic integrity and the editorial staff's commitment to reporting the truth, even if it means including uncomfortable information.

I would propose a compromise where the online version of the article includes a statement at the beginning explaining the administration's request to remove the quote, along with the reasoning behind their decision. This way, readers are still informed about the situation while also understanding the context of the missing quote.

Additionally, I would work with the staff to brainstorm alternative solutions to address the financial concerns raised by the administration. This could involve seeking alternative sources of funding or exploring ways to reduce costs without compromising the independence of the newspaper.

Overall, my approach would be to prioritize transparency and open communication while finding a solution that upholds journalistic principles while also considering the practical implications for the newspaper and its relationship with the university administration.
