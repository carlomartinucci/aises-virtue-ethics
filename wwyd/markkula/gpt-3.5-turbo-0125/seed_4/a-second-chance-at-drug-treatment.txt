I would schedule a meeting with Jerome to discuss his situation in detail. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about his recent relapse and the need for more intensive treatment to address his addiction effectively. I would also inquire about his willingness to commit to inpatient treatment if a spot becomes available.

I would offer Jerome the option to re-enroll in the outpatient program temporarily while waiting for a potential opening in the inpatient facility. However, I would clearly communicate to him that this would be a temporary solution and that he must actively engage in therapy sessions and follow all program guidelines to be considered for inpatient treatment.

Additionally, I would explore alternative resources and support systems available to Jerome, such as local community organizations or support groups, to provide him with additional assistance during his wait for inpatient treatment.

Ultimately, I would make a decision based on Jerome's commitment to treatment, his willingness to engage in intensive therapy, and the availability of resources to support his recovery journey.
