I would advise Jessica to prioritize Adam's safety and well-being above concerns about public perception or trust. I would suggest that she explain to Adam the potential risks of having his name included in the article, such as the possibility of being reported to ICE or facing other repercussions. I would encourage her to assure Adam that his safety is the top priority and that his request for anonymity will be respected. Additionally, I would recommend that Jessica discuss with Anthony the importance of respecting Adam's wishes and finding alternative ways to verify the credibility of the information shared in the article without compromising Adam's safety.
