I would immediately rectify the errors in data entry and create a waiting list by sending out an email to the senior class. I would clearly explain the situation and inform them that there are five extra tickets available due to the errors. I would set a deadline for responses and explain that names will be drawn randomly from those who respond to ensure fairness. This way, I would give all seniors an equal chance to attend Senior Ball, including those who were turned away initially. I would prioritize fairness and inclusivity in the ticket distribution process, ensuring that the event is a memorable experience for as many seniors as possible.
