In this situation, I would advise Hana to cover the story of the student's death in a sensitive and responsible manner. To do this, she should:

1. Reach out to the family of the deceased student to express condolences and discuss the possibility of writing an obituary that highlights his positive contributions to campus life.

2. Consult with mental health professionals or counselors at the school to gather information about the best practices for reporting on suicide and promoting mental health awareness.

3. Craft the article focusing on the student's achievements and involvement on campus while also addressing the importance of mental health care and resources available to students.

4. Include information about suicide prevention helplines and other mental health resources in the article to provide support to those who may be struggling.

5. Avoid sensationalizing or providing graphic details about the death, in line with the recommendations of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.

By following these steps, Hana can honor the memory of the student, raise awareness about mental health issues, and foster a constructive dialogue within the campus community.
