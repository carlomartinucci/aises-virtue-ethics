I would review the company's policies and guidelines regarding rehiring terminated employees, as well as any specific provisions related to employees with disabilities such as ASD. I would then arrange a meeting with relevant stakeholders, including HR, legal, and management, to discuss Matt's request for reinstatement in light of his ASD disclosure. During the meeting, I would advocate for a fair reassessment of the situation, taking into consideration the new information about Matt's condition and his past experiences with discrimination. I would propose a structured plan for addressing any potential challenges related to accommodating Matt's needs in the workplace, ensuring that the company upholds its commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunity.
