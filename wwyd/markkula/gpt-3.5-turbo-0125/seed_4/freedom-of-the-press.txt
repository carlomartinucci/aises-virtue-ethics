Carrie should include the topic of the new statue and student jokes about it in her video about trending conversation topics among students on campus. She can present it in a balanced manner by acknowledging the humor and opinions surrounding the statue while also highlighting the differing perspectives on campus. This way, she can maintain transparency and authenticity in representing student conversations while being mindful of the potential impact on donor relations. Carrie could also consider including positive aspects or alternative viewpoints related to the statue to provide a fair representation of the overall campus sentiment.
