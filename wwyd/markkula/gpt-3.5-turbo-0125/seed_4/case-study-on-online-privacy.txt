I would conduct research to gather information on the efficacy, accuracy, and potential negative impacts of using facial recognition technology and social media monitoring tools in educational settings. This research would involve reviewing studies, reports, and expert opinions on the subject to understand the benefits and risks associated with these technologies. I would also seek out case studies of schools or universities that have implemented these tools to learn from their experiences and outcomes. Additionally, I would investigate any legal or ethical concerns that have been raised regarding the use of such surveillance technologies in educational institutions.
