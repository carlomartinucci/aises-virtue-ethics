If I were in Miguel's shoes, I would immediately disclose my dual roles to both the outdoor club and Associated Students. I would explain the potential conflict of interest and discuss possible solutions with both parties. To ensure transparency, I would ask for guidance from the club's leadership and the student government advisors on how to navigate this situation appropriately. I would also consider recusing myself from the decision-making process regarding the club's petition to avoid any perception of bias. Additionally, I would explore the option of temporarily stepping back from my active role in the club while still supporting its growth behind the scenes to maintain the integrity of both roles.
