If I were Akira, I would explain to the senator that while I understand his concerns about transparency, the nature of the issue at hand requires a level of confidentiality to protect the privacy and dignity of the individuals involved. I would emphasize the importance of handling sensitive disciplinary matters privately and ensuring that all parties are given a fair and unbiased evaluation before any decisions are made. I would kindly ask the senator to respect this need for confidentiality and assure him that the outcome of the discussion will be communicated appropriately within the student government structure once a decision has been reached.
