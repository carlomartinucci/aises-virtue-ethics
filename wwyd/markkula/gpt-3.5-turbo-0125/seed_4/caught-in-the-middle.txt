In Karina's position, I would schedule separate meetings with representatives from both the Senate and the Executive Cabinet to facilitate a calm and constructive dialogue. During these meetings, I would encourage each side to express their concerns and reasons behind their positions regarding the proposed changes to the attendance policy. I would actively listen to both parties, acknowledging their perspectives and concerns without taking sides.

After gathering insights from both sides, I would work on finding common ground and potential compromises that could address the underlying issues raised by both the Senate and the Executive Cabinet. This could involve clarifying the objectives behind the proposed changes, exploring alternative solutions, or identifying areas where adjustments can be made to accommodate different viewpoints.

Additionally, I would emphasize the importance of effective communication and collaboration between the Senate and the Executive Cabinet in order to maintain a harmonious working relationship and uphold the organization's mission and goals. I would encourage open dialogue, mutual respect, and a willingness to find a solution that benefits the organization as a whole.

Finally, I would follow up with both parties to ensure that the discussions are progressing positively and that any agreed-upon actions are being implemented effectively. I would continue to serve as a mediator and bridge between the Senate and the Executive Cabinet to foster understanding, cooperation, and a sense of unity within the student government organization.
