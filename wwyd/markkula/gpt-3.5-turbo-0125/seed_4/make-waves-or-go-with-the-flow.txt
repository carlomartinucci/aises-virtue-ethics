I would advise Claire to have a private conversation with Fred to express her concerns about the unrealistic time budget for the audit engagement. During this conversation, I would suggest that Claire explain the specific tasks that are taking longer than anticipated and provide concrete examples of why the budgeted hours are insufficient. I would recommend she propose a revised estimate for the hours needed to complete the audit work effectively and maintain audit quality standards. Additionally, I would advise Claire to seek clarification from Fred on how to handle charging time spent on training over the weekend, ensuring transparency and adherence to the firm's policies and ethical standards.
