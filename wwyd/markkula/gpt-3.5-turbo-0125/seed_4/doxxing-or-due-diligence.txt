I would advise Andres to respect the student's request for anonymity in the article. Given that the student is facing social backlash and fears further ostracization, it is important to prioritize his well-being and protect him from potential harm or severe consequences. Respecting his wish to remain anonymous will help safeguard his mental and emotional health in light of the current situation.

To address concerns about accountability for controversial views, Andres can provide context within the article to explain why the student's name is redacted. By transparently outlining the reasons for anonymity, readers can understand the decision-making process behind protecting the student's identity.

Furthermore, Andres could offer the student an opportunity to share any reflections or clarifications regarding his original post, even if anonymously. This might allow the student to address any misunderstandings or provide additional context without exposing himself to further backlash.

Ultimately, prioritizing the student's well-being and respecting his request for anonymity while providing transparency in the reporting process can help navigate the ethical considerations in this situation.
