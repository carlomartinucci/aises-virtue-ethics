I would express my gratitude to the President and Vice President for offering me the Director of Marketing position. I would then ask for some time to consider the offer and consult with trusted mentors or advisors within the organization. During this time, I would carefully evaluate my own interests and skills, as well as the needs of the student government as a whole. I would also have a candid conversation with my friend who wanted the marketing position, explaining my thought process and decision-making factors. Additionally, I would reach out to past Directors of Marketing to gain insights into the role and its impact on the organization. Based on all these considerations, I would make a decision that aligns with both my personal growth goals and the best interests of the student government.
