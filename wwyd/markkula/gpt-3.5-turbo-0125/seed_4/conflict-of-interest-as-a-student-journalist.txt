I would advise Nadia to disclose her involvement with the student organization and the protest in her article about the working conditions of the custodial staff. By being transparent about her connections to the cause, Nadia can maintain her credibility as a journalist and demonstrate her commitment to ethical reporting. This disclosure would help readers understand her perspective and potential biases, allowing them to interpret the information presented with that context in mind. Additionally, Nadia should make an effort to seek out a variety of perspectives and voices for the article to ensure a well-rounded and balanced representation of the issue.
