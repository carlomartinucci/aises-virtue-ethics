I would first conduct a thorough review of the informed consent process used in the clinical trial in Russia to ensure that it met all necessary ethical standards. This would involve examining the consent form given to participants, assessing whether they were provided with adequate information about the trial, its risks, benefits, and the nature of the drug being tested. I would also evaluate whether the participants were truly able to understand this information given their educational background and knowledge level.

If it is found that the participants were not able to fully comprehend the information provided to them due to their lack of relevant education and understanding of scientific concepts, I would work with the pharmaceutical company to address this issue. This could involve implementing additional measures to ensure that informed consent is truly obtained, such as providing educational materials in a more accessible format or utilizing trained interpreters to convey complex information in a way that participants can understand.

Furthermore, I would advocate for the pharmaceutical company to establish a plan to provide continued access to the drug and medical care for the clinical trial participants once the trial has ended. It is important to ensure that these individuals do not suffer adverse consequences due to the discontinuation of treatment, especially considering the progress they had made during the trial. This may involve negotiating with the company to provide the medication at a reduced cost or exploring other options to support the ongoing healthcare needs of the participants.
