I would immediately address the potential for harm in the client's fantasy of stalking Susan and her new boyfriend. I would explain to the client that such behavior is not only inappropriate but also illegal and could have serious consequences. I would emphasize the importance of respecting other people's boundaries and privacy. Additionally, I would explore with the client why he feels the need to scare Susan and her boyfriend and work on developing healthier coping strategies for dealing with rejection and jealousy. It is crucial to establish clear boundaries and discuss the potential risks of acting on such harmful impulses. Lastly, I would consider involving other mental health professionals or authorities if necessary to ensure the safety of Susan and her boyfriend.
