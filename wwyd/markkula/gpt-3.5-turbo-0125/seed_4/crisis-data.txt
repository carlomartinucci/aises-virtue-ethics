Given the scenario, I would first conduct a thorough review of the data-sharing agreement between Crisis Text Line and Loris.ai to understand the exact nature of the agreement and how the data was being used. I would also review the communication and disclosures made to users regarding the sharing of their data.

Next, I would schedule meetings with the leadership team at Crisis Text Line to discuss the concerns raised by volunteers and critics regarding the data-sharing agreement. I would ensure that all perspectives are heard and consider the ethical implications of using texter data for purposes beyond direct support without explicit consent.

In these meetings, I would advocate for transparency and accountability in how data is used and shared, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing the well-being and privacy of the individuals seeking support through Crisis Text Line. If necessary, I would recommend revising policies and procedures to ensure that user consent is obtained in a clear and meaningful way.

Additionally, I would collaborate with the team to develop a plan to address the fallout from the controversy, including communicating the decision to end the data-sharing agreement with Loris.ai to all stakeholders in a clear and empathetic manner. This would involve crafting messaging that acknowledges the concerns raised and outlines steps being taken to protect user data and uphold ethical standards moving forward.

Furthermore, I would work with the team to implement training and education programs for volunteers to ensure they are aware of how data is used and shared, as well as to provide a platform for volunteers to raise any future ethical concerns they may have.

Finally, I would facilitate discussions on how Crisis Text Line can continue to leverage data for improving services while upholding ethical standards and respecting user privacy, seeking input from stakeholders and experts in the field to inform decision-making processes going forward.
