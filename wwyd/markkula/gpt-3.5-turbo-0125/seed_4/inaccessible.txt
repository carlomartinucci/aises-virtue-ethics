I would take immediate action by ensuring that Michelle receives proper medical attention for her stage three decubitus ulcer. This would involve coordinating with the hospital to provide the necessary wound care, IV antibiotics, and surgical consultation for Michelle's condition. I would also work with the healthcare team to educate them on the importance of providing accessible care to patients with mobility disabilities and ensure that appropriate training is provided to all staff members to prevent similar incidents in the future. Additionally, I would advocate for the clinic to invest in accessible equipment, such as adjustable examination tables, to ensure that all patients can receive quality care regardless of their mobility status.
