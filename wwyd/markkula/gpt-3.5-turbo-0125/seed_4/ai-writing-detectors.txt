In this scenario, if I were working at Turnitin, I would immediately convene a team of AI and machine learning experts to thoroughly review the current AI detection model. The team would be tasked with identifying and addressing the issues that lead to false positives, especially when the real author is not a native English speaker. The goal would be to improve the model's accuracy and reliability, aiming to reduce the number of false positives to ensure fair treatment of all students, regardless of their linguistic background. Additionally, I would collaborate with educational institutions and researchers to gather feedback on the current AI detection feature and work towards enhancing its effectiveness while minimizing the risk of unfairly accusing students of plagiarism.
