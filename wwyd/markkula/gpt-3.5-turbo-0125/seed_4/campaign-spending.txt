I would advise James to limit his campaign spending in order to level the playing field for Alix. He should consider reallocating some of the funds originally planned for extravagant items like renting sports cars to more equitable initiatives that can benefit both candidates equally. This could involve investing in joint events or debates that showcase the strengths and ideas of both candidates without the need for excessive spending. By making this decision, James can demonstrate his commitment to fairness and integrity in the election process, while still running a strong and effective campaign based on merit rather than financial advantage.
