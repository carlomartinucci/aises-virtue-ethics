I would advise Dave to immediately stop the arrangement with Alex. Dave should report the illegal activity of the non-profit managers to both his own organization and the appropriate authorities in the Dominican Republic. He should provide all the necessary evidence and information to ensure that proper investigations are conducted. Additionally, Dave should seek guidance from his organization's legal team on how to proceed in a way that upholds legal and ethical standards. Finally, Dave should work towards finding a legitimate and transparent way to continue supporting the housing project for the poor without engaging in illegal activities or enabling corruption.
