I would advise Dave to immediately stop the arrangement with Alex and report the illegal currency exchange activities of the non-profit to the appropriate authorities. Dave should also seek guidance from his organization's leadership on how to proceed in a way that upholds ethical standards and legal requirements. Additionally, Dave should work towards finding a legitimate and transparent way to continue funding the housing project for the unhoused individuals in the Dominican Republic.
