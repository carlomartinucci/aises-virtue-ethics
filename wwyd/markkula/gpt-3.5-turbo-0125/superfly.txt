I would carefully review the terms and conditions of SuperFly to ensure that they are transparent and clearly outline what customers can expect from the service. I would pay close attention to any disclaimers regarding the limitations of the VR experience compared to a traditional vacation.

Additionally, I would verify that the smartraVeleR consultants are properly trained to provide accurate information and guidance to customers. I would ensure that they are knowledgeable about the destinations offered and are able to assist customers in customizing their VR vacation experience effectively.

Furthermore, I would monitor customer feedback and reviews to identify any potential issues or concerns that may arise with the SuperFly service. If there are any recurring complaints or problems reported by customers, I would take proactive steps to address them and improve the overall customer experience.

Overall, my focus would be on ensuring that customers are well-informed, supported, and satisfied with their SuperFly VR vacation experience.
