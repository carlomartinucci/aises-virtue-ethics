In Talia's position, I would schedule a meeting with the university administration to discuss their concerns in more detail. I would ask for specific examples of how the smoking ban could potentially violate student rights and open the university to lawsuits. By gaining a better understanding of the administration's perspective, I could potentially work towards finding a compromise that addresses their concerns while still aligning with the desires of the student body. Additionally, I would seek legal advice from the university's legal department or external legal counsel to fully understand the potential legal implications of the smoking ban. This way, I can make a more informed decision that takes into account both the student body's wishes and the university's concerns.
