I would suggest to Kyle's parents that enrolling him in Eminent Scholars could provide him with a more suitable learning environment that caters to his individual needs. I would recommend arranging a meeting with the school's staff to discuss how they address social skills development for students like Kyle. This meeting would allow Kyle's parents to gain a better understanding of the school's approach to fostering social interaction and ensuring that Kyle receives the necessary support in this aspect.

Additionally, I would advise Kyle's parents to request a trial period for Kyle at Eminent Scholars to observe firsthand how he adapts to the one-to-one learning environment. This trial period would provide valuable insights into whether the school's personalized education approach positively impacts Kyle's academic performance and social development.

Furthermore, I would suggest that Kyle's parents explore supplemental social skills programs or extracurricular activities outside of school to ensure that Kyle has opportunities to interact with peers and enhance his communication and teamwork abilities. This holistic approach could help address the concerns about potential social isolation while still benefiting from the tailored education offered at Eminent Scholars.
