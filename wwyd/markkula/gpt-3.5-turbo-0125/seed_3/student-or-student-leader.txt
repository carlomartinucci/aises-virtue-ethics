I would start by discussing the situation with the senators individually to understand their perspectives and commitments. I would then gather input from the rest of the Senate to see if there are any potential solutions or compromises that could be explored. One option could be to allow the two senators to participate in the meetings remotely through video conferencing or by submitting reports in advance. Additionally, we could consider adjusting the attendance policy on a case-by-case basis to accommodate the senators' unique circumstances. This way, we could ensure that their voices are still heard and their constituents are represented, while also upholding the integrity of the organization.
