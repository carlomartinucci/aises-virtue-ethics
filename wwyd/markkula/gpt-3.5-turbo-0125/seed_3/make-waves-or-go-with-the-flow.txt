I would first schedule a meeting with Fred to discuss the concerns raised about the audit hours and the pressure to be more efficient without compromising the quality of the work. During the meeting, I would express my commitment to completing the audit thoroughly and within the necessary hours, while also highlighting the challenges faced by the team in meeting the current budgeted hours.

I would then propose a plan to Fred that includes revisiting the audit budget and scope to ensure that it aligns with the actual work required for the audit of Company Z. This may involve adjusting the budgeted hours and seeking additional resources or support to meet the audit requirements effectively.

Furthermore, I would seek clarification from Fred on how the team should approach charging hours spent on training over the weekend. I would express my willingness to complete the required training but would request guidance on whether these hours should be charged to training or the audit client.

Lastly, I would document the outcomes of the meeting with Fred and any agreed-upon actions to ensure transparency and alignment within the team regarding the audit hours, efficiency expectations, and training requirements.
