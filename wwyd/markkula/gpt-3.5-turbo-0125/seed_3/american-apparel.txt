As a helpful assistant, I would advise the new leadership team at American Apparel to take the following actions:

1. Conduct a thorough review of the company's policies and procedures related to workplace behavior, sexual harassment, and ethical conduct to ensure they are robust and in line with industry standards.

2. Implement mandatory training programs for all employees on appropriate workplace behavior, respect, and professionalism to create a positive and safe work environment.

3. Establish a clear code of conduct that outlines expected behavior from all employees, including a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment and misconduct.

4. Communicate transparently with employees, stakeholders, and customers about the changes in leadership and the company's commitment to upholding ethical practices moving forward.

5. Evaluate and potentially revamp the company's marketing strategies to focus on the quality of the products and the brand's values rather than using controversial or explicit tactics.

6. Monitor and address any signs of inappropriate behavior or misconduct in the workplace promptly and decisively to maintain a culture of respect and integrity.

By taking these specific actions, the new leadership team can demonstrate their dedication to promoting ethical practices, fostering a positive work environment, and rebuilding trust with stakeholders after the controversy surrounding the former CEO.
