I would schedule a meeting with each of my three student staff members individually to discuss their current workload and stress levels. During these meetings, I would openly communicate my concerns about potentially overloading them with responsibilities and inquire about any challenges they may be facing in managing their tasks. I would also seek their input on how I can better support them and ensure that they are able to fulfill their duties effectively.

Based on the feedback received from my staff members, I would reassess the distribution of responsibilities within the team. If it appears that they are indeed overwhelmed, I would work with them to prioritize tasks and potentially redistribute some of the workload to ensure a more balanced distribution of responsibilities. I would also explore potential solutions such as adjusting deadlines, providing additional training or resources, or seeking assistance from other departments if necessary.

Additionally, I would reflect on my own workload and assess whether I have indeed delegated too many responsibilities, especially those outlined in my own position description. If I identify key tasks that are crucial for the overall success of my role, such as advocating for student financial aid and government funding at the state level, I would consider reclaiming some of these responsibilities to ensure that they are effectively addressed.

Ultimately, my goal would be to support my team members, maintain a healthy balance of responsibilities, and ensure that all key duties, including those at the state level, are being adequately addressed to fulfill the responsibilities of my role as the External Relations Vice President of Associated Students Inc.
