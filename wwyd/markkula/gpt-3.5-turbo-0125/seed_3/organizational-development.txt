I would suggest that Carlos explore alternative funding options for the retreat before considering taking money from programs that directly benefit the student body. He could reach out to potential sponsors or partners who may be willing to contribute financially in exchange for recognition or involvement in the retreat activities. Additionally, he could organize a fundraising event specifically for the retreat to offset the increased costs.

If after exhausting all other options, taking money from the student government budget is the only feasible solution, I would recommend that Carlos transparently communicate the situation to the student body. He should explain the importance of the retreat in fostering leadership skills and cohesion among student government members, and the potential impact on student government programs if the retreat is not held. Seeking input and feedback from the student body on this decision could help in making a more informed choice.
