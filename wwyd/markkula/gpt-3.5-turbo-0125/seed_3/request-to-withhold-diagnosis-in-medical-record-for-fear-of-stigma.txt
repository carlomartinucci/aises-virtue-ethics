I would begin by expressing empathy towards Sophie and acknowledging the challenges she is facing. I would then explain to Sophie the importance of addressing mental health concerns openly and honestly, especially in a high-stress environment like medical training. I would educate Sophie about the potential consequences of not disclosing her history of depression, including the impact it could have on her future medical licensing and ability to practice medicine. I would emphasize the importance of seeking therapy in addition to medication for the most effective treatment of depression. I would offer to help her find a therapist who would prioritize her privacy and confidentiality. I would also discuss the possibility of seeking accommodations or support from the medical school to help her manage her workload and mental health during this challenging time. Ultimately, I would encourage Sophie to prioritize her well-being and seek comprehensive mental health care, even if it means facing difficult conversations or potential challenges in the future.
