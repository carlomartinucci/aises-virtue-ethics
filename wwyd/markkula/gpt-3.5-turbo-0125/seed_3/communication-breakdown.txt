I would advise Derek to schedule a meeting with the Vice Provost specifically to address the issue of the targeted thefts affecting off-campus fraternities and sororities. In the meeting, Derek should present the situation as a serious concern affecting a significant portion of the student body, emphasizing the impact on student safety and well-being. Derek should provide specific examples of incidents and their effects on the students involved.

Derek should also propose potential solutions or actions that the university could take to address the issue, such as increased campus security patrols in the affected areas or working with local law enforcement to investigate the thefts. By framing the issue as a matter of student safety and well-being, Derek may be able to appeal to the Vice Provost's sense of responsibility towards the student body and demonstrate the importance of addressing the issue despite the university's official stance on Greek life.

Additionally, Derek could seek support from other student government leaders and student organizations to collectively advocate for addressing the targeted thefts, showing a unified front of student concern and engagement on the issue. By collaborating with other student groups, Derek can strengthen his position and increase the likelihood of the Vice Provost taking action to address the problem.

Overall, by proactively addressing the issue with the Vice Provost, presenting it as a matter of student well-being, and seeking support from other student groups, Derek can navigate the delicate balance between representing student interests authentically and maintaining a productive relationship with the administration.
