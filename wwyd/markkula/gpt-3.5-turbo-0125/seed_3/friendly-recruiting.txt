I would first review the applications of the remaining candidates to see if any of them possess relevant skills or experiences that could potentially fit the needs of the specific committees. If there are applicants who show promise but may need additional support or training to fulfill the roles effectively, I would consider offering them mentoring or resources to help them succeed.

If after this review process, I still feel that the candidates do not fully meet the needs of the committees, I would reach out to the respective committee chairs to discuss the situation. I would explain the challenges in matching candidates to the committees and ask for their input on potential solutions.

If there are no viable options among the existing applicants, I would consider approaching my friends and encouraging them to apply for the positions. However, I would make sure to maintain transparency and integrity throughout the process by informing the committee chairs about the situation and seeking their approval before proceeding with the nomination of my friends.
