I would advise Angela to recuse herself from voting on the funding request for the Hawaiian cultural club's luau event due to her close personal relationship with Emily, the president of the club. By recusing herself, Angela can avoid any potential conflict of interest and uphold the integrity of the decision-making process within the student senate. Additionally, I would suggest that Angela communicate her decision to recuse herself to the other senators present at the meeting to ensure transparency and maintain the Senate's credibility.
