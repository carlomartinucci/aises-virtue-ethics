Given the scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Conduct a thorough review of all current suppliers in countries where child labor is prevalent, such as India, Nepal, and Bangladesh, to identify any instances of child labor within their operations.

2. Implement a new supplier audit process that includes regular on-site visits to production sites to ensure compliance with labor laws and ethical standards, specifically focusing on child labor.

3. Develop a clear and comprehensive code of conduct for suppliers, outlining the prohibition of child labor and the consequences for non-compliance.

4. Provide training and education sessions for IKEA buyers and staff involved in supplier management to raise awareness about the issue of child labor and the importance of monitoring and reporting any violations.

5. Collaborate with local NGOs and labor rights organizations in countries where child labor is prevalent to support initiatives aimed at eradicating child labor and improving working conditions.

6. Establish a transparent reporting mechanism for employees and external stakeholders to report any concerns or violations related to child labor in the supply chain.

By taking these concrete actions, IKEA can demonstrate its commitment to addressing the issue of child labor in its supply chain and work towards improving the well-being of workers in countries where its products are manufactured.
