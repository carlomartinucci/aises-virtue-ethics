If I were in this scenario, I would first assess the potential impact of the situation on Snapchat's reputation and user trust. I would then recommend that the company issue a public statement addressing the situation directly. This statement should acknowledge the seriousness of the emails, express genuine remorse for the content, and outline concrete steps that the company and its leadership are taking to ensure that such behavior is not tolerated within the organization. Additionally, I would advise implementing sensitivity training for all employees, especially those in leadership positions, to promote a more inclusive and respectful work environment. It would also be crucial to monitor public sentiment and engage with stakeholders to address any concerns or questions that may arise.
