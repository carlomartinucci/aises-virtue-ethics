I would meet with Jerome to discuss his situation and express my concerns about his recent overdose and his need for more intensive inpatient treatment due to the severity of his addiction. I would emphasize the importance of his health and well-being, as well as the need for a more comprehensive form of treatment to address his addiction effectively. I would provide him with information on alternative treatment options, including the inpatient facility, and offer to assist him in navigating the process of getting admitted there despite the challenges he may face. I would also express my willingness to support him in any way possible, whether it be through counseling, referrals, or advocacy for his insurance coverage. Ultimately, I would encourage Jerome to consider the inpatient treatment as a crucial step towards his recovery and offer my ongoing support throughout his journey.
