In Olivia's position, I would first seek guidance from a mentor or advisor within the university's Associated Students Inc. to discuss my concerns and get an external perspective on the situation. I would openly share my thoughts and intentions with this trusted individual and ask for their feedback on whether my current actions are appropriate in the context of the upcoming election.

Additionally, I would consider holding a meeting with the other potential candidates for ASI president, if possible, to inform them of the election timeline and discuss the situation transparently. By sharing this information with others who may be impacted, I can ensure that everyone has equal opportunity to prepare for the election process.

Furthermore, I would review the university's guidelines and policies regarding election campaigns to ensure that my actions align with the established rules and principles of fair competition. If necessary, I would make adjustments to my campaign preparation to comply with any ethical standards or regulations that may be in place.

Overall, by seeking advice from a mentor, engaging in open communication with other candidates, and verifying compliance with university policies, I can address my concerns about fairness and ethical conduct in preparing for the ASI presidential election.
