I would politely decline Alex's request to meet and review the funding proposal personally. I would explain to Alex that it is important for all student organizations to have an equal opportunity in the funding process, and meeting with one specific group could create a perception of favoritism or unfair advantage. I would reassure Alex that the online resources and tip guides provided by Associated Students are designed to help all student organizations craft strong proposals, and encourage him to utilize those resources to improve his proposal. I would also offer to answer any general questions Alex may have about the funding process to ensure he feels supported in his application.
