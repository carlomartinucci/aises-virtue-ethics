I would convene a meeting with key stakeholders, including student representatives, faculty members, and upper-level administrators, to discuss the situation. During the meeting, I would explain the concerns raised by students about the email volume and the potential impact on student engagement if additional emails were to be sent out. I would also highlight the value of the current system in promoting student events and ensuring that important information is not overlooked.

I would propose a solution where faculty members are encouraged to collaborate with student organizations to have their information included in the weekly newsletter sent out by the student government. This way, faculty can still reach students with important information, but in a more consolidated and student-friendly format. I would emphasize the importance of maintaining the current balance to prevent overwhelming students with excessive emails.

Furthermore, I would suggest exploring alternative communication channels for faculty members to reach students, such as utilizing existing platforms like the university website, social media, or dedicated bulletin boards. By fostering collaboration and finding creative solutions, we can ensure that both student and faculty needs are met while mitigating the risk of email overload for students.
