I would schedule a dedicated appointment with the patient to address his concerns about contracting syphilis. During the appointment, I would calmly and empathetically explore his beliefs about having syphilis despite multiple negative test results. I would inquire about his recent sexual history to clarify any inconsistencies in his statements.

Based on the information gathered, I would provide psychoeducation about delusions and how they can sometimes manifest in mental health conditions like schizophrenia. I would reassure the patient that his test results are accurate and discuss the importance of adhering to the prescribed psychiatric medication to manage his schizophrenia effectively.

Additionally, I would collaborate with the patient to develop a plan for managing his distress and anxiety related to the perceived syphilis infection. This could involve exploring coping strategies, considering therapy options, or involving other healthcare professionals if necessary.

Ultimately, my goal would be to address the patient's concerns about syphilis in a compassionate and understanding manner while emphasizing the importance of treatment adherence for both his mental health and overall well-being.
