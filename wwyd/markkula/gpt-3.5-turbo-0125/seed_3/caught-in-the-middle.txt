In Karina's position, I would schedule a mediation session between the Executive Cabinet and the Senate to facilitate open dialogue and understanding between the two sides. I would create a structured environment where each side can express their concerns and perspectives without interruptions. I would encourage active listening and seek to find common ground between the differing viewpoints. Additionally, I would propose a compromise solution that takes into account the concerns raised by both the Executive Cabinet and the Senate regarding the attendance policy. This compromise could involve a revised policy that addresses the issues of accountability and trust while respecting the autonomy and leadership of the Senators. Finally, I would work towards building consensus and unity within the organization by emphasizing the shared values and goals of the Executive Cabinet and the Senate.
