In Talia's position, I would schedule a town hall meeting with the sophomore students in her constituency to openly discuss the proposed smoking ban. During the meeting, I would present the concerns raised by the university administration regarding student rights and potential lawsuits. I would also provide a platform for students to share their thoughts and concerns about the ban.

After gathering feedback from the students, I would work on a compromise proposal that takes into account both the desires of the students for a smoke-free campus and the concerns raised by the university administration. This proposal could involve implementing designated smoking areas on campus or enforcing stricter regulations on smoking rather than a complete ban.

I would then communicate this compromise proposal to both the student body and the university administration, emphasizing the importance of finding a solution that balances the health concerns with the rights of the students. Finally, I would cast my vote based on the feedback received from the students and the compromise proposal developed through open dialogue and collaboration.
