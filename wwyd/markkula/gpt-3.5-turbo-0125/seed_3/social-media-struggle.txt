Matt should privately reach out to John and express his concerns about the video. He should explain that while he understands the culture of college and underage drinking, as a member of student government, it is important to uphold a certain level of professionalism and integrity. Matt should suggest that John consider taking down the video or making his profile more private to avoid any negative repercussions for himself or the organization. Matt should offer his support to help John navigate this situation and make better decisions in the future.
