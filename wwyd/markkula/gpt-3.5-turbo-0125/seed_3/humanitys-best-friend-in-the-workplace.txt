I would advise Bruce to have an open and honest conversation with Spencer about the situation. Bruce should express his concerns regarding the accommodation of Spencer's emotional support animal in the program, including the potential impact on students and staff members who may have allergies or fears of dogs. Bruce should also discuss the additional costs that would be incurred by providing separate housing and transportation for Spencer and his dog.

During this conversation, Bruce should explore potential compromises or alternative solutions with Spencer. This could include finding ways to minimize the presence of the dog around students and staff who are allergic or fearful, or discussing the possibility of having the dog accompany Spencer only during specific times or tasks where it is absolutely necessary for his well-being. Bruce should also clearly communicate the organization's financial constraints and the need to balance accommodating Spencer's needs with the overall viability of the program.

Ultimately, Bruce should strive to find a solution that prioritizes both Spencer's well-being and the well-being of the students and staff in the program. By engaging in a respectful and open dialogue with Spencer and exploring creative solutions together, Bruce can demonstrate his commitment to doing the right thing while also considering the practical implications for the organization.
