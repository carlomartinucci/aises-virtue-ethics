I would conduct a thorough review of the product's design and features to ensure that the focus on encouraging physical activity is balanced with considerations for the well-being and mental health of the children using it. This review would involve examining the impact of the celebratory animations, the emotional attachment to the customizable creature, and the potential effects of gamification elements on children's behavior and self-esteem. Based on these findings, I would recommend adjustments to the product's features and notifications to promote a healthier relationship with physical activity and technology for young users.
