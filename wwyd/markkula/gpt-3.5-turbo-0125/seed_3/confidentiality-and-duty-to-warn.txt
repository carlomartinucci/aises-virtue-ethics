I would immediately address the client's fantasy of stalking Susan and her new boyfriend by discussing the potential consequences of such actions, both legally and emotionally. I would emphasize the importance of respecting others' boundaries and choices in relationships. I would explore with the client the underlying emotions and insecurities that may be driving these thoughts, and work on developing healthier coping mechanisms for managing rejection and disappointment. I would also assess the client's risk for potential harm to himself or others and consider involving other mental health professionals or authorities if necessary for the safety of all involved.
