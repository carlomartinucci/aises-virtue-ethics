I would start by reassuring Julia that our conversation is confidential and that my primary concern is her well-being. I would then ask her open-ended questions to understand her perspective and feelings better, such as "Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling lately?" and "What has been particularly difficult for you?" I would listen attentively and show empathy towards her struggles.

Next, I would discuss the seriousness of her situation and the importance of seeking help. I would explain the potential risks associated with untreated major depressive disorder and the importance of exploring different treatment options. I would offer to work with her collaboratively to find a treatment plan that she feels comfortable with, emphasizing that her input is valuable in the decision-making process.

Given her reluctance to involve her parents or commit to seeing her regular doctor, I would respect her autonomy as an adult while also emphasizing the importance of having a support system in place. I would encourage her to consider involving a trusted friend or family member in her treatment journey if she feels comfortable.

Lastly, I would provide her with resources for mental health support, such as crisis hotlines, support groups, and online resources. I would also schedule a follow-up appointment to check in on her progress and continue to offer support and guidance in managing her depression.

Overall, my approach would focus on building trust with Julia, respecting her autonomy, and collaborating with her to create a personalized treatment plan that addresses her concerns and needs.
