I would thank the donor for their interest in supporting the university and for considering making a donation. I would express appreciation for their desire to give back to the community. 

Given the donor's association with the financial group that had a history of predatory lending practices, I would diplomatically acknowledge the past issues associated with the company while also noting that the donor was not personally involved in those controversies. I would explain to the donor that the university is committed to ethical fundraising practices and upholding its values of diversity and inclusion in STEM education. 

I would then suggest to the donor that we could set up a meeting to discuss their philanthropic goals and the specific areas within the university's STEM programs where their donation could make a significant impact. During this meeting, I would seek to understand the donor's motivations for giving back to the community and how they envision their donations benefiting students from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM fields. 

I would also inform the donor that the university has rigorous processes in place to ensure that all donations are used in alignment with the university's values and missions. I would assure the donor that their contribution would support the university's efforts to promote diversity and inclusivity in STEM education. 

Overall, my action would be to engage with the donor in a respectful and transparent manner, while also emphasizing the importance of ethical fundraising practices and the university's commitment to diversity and inclusion in STEM education.
