Given the scenario, I would advise Elena to have a private conversation with Jack to discuss the inaccuracies in his piece. She should explain to him the information obtained from the Admissions Office, clarifying that the university does not practice affirmative action. Elena should request that Jack revise his article to reflect this new information accurately.

Additionally, Elena should provide Jack with resources or guidance on fact-checking and verifying information before submitting future opinion pieces. This conversation should emphasize the importance of maintaining journalistic integrity and accuracy in all published content.

If Jack refuses to revise his article or insists on maintaining his original viewpoint despite the verified information, Elena should consider not publishing the piece. She should explain to Jack that the article contains factual inaccuracies that cannot be endorsed or published by the newspaper. Elena should also express that while the paper values diverse opinions, it cannot compromise on accuracy and truthfulness.

In the event that Jack chooses not to revise the article and insists on its publication, Elena should inform the editorial board or a higher authority within the newspaper organization about the situation. This would ensure that the decision is made collectively and transparently, upholding the newspaper's commitment to accuracy and journalistic ethics.
