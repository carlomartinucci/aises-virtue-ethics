I would advise James to reconsider his campaign spending and actions in light of the significant resource disparity between him and Alix. Instead of renting several black Mercedes Benz sports cars on Election Day to drive students to classes, back and forth across campus, exclusively for those who vote for his ticket, I would suggest that James explore alternative ways to engage with the student body that do not rely on such extravagant and potentially coercive tactics.

James could redirect the funds allocated for renting the sports cars towards more equitable and inclusive campaign strategies. For example, he could invest in additional outreach efforts to connect with a wider range of students, such as hosting open forums, creating informational materials, or organizing events that promote dialogue and understanding of his platform. By prioritizing fairness and inclusivity in his campaign approach, James can demonstrate his commitment to ethical leadership and respect for his fellow candidates and the student body.
