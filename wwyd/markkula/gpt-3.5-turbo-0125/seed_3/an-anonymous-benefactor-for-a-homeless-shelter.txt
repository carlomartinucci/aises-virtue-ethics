I would express gratitude to the donor for their generous offer and let them know that I understand and respect their wish to remain anonymous. I would assure them that their identity will not be disclosed to anyone within the organization, and that their gift will be used to greatly benefit the families in need and the staff at the shelter.

I would inform the donor that the organization has a strict policy on donor confidentiality, and that their request to remain anonymous will be honored. I would then work with our finance and legal departments to ensure that the donation is processed in a way that protects the donor's anonymity while complying with all legal and ethical guidelines.

I would also take this opportunity to update our records with the details of the donation, ensuring that the funds are allocated appropriately for the expansion of the shelter and the support of staff members. Throughout the process, I would maintain open communication with the donor to update them on the impact of their gift and express our ongoing appreciation for their support.
