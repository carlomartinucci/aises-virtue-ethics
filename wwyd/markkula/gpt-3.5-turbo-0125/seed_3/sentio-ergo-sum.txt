I would conduct a thorough review of the company's policies and procedures regarding the use of the Cogito software to ensure that all legal and ethical requirements are being met. This review would include examining the terms of service and privacy policy to ensure that customers are fully informed about the extent of the software's monitoring and analysis of their interactions. Additionally, I would assess the transparency of the notifications provided to call center agents and callers to ensure that they are clear and easily understood. If any gaps or deficiencies are identified, I would work with the relevant stakeholders to implement necessary changes to enhance transparency and protect the privacy rights of both employees and customers.
