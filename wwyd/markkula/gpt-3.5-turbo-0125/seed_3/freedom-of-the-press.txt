Carrie should consider including the topic of the statue in the video, as it is a trending conversation among students on campus. To balance transparency and sensitivity, she could present the discussion in a neutral and objective manner, avoiding overly negative or derogatory remarks. Carrie could focus on accurately reflecting the students' opinions and humor about the statue without endorsing or encouraging disrespectful comments. Additionally, she could include diverse perspectives on the topic to provide a well-rounded view of the conversation. This approach allows Carrie to acknowledge the student sentiment while maintaining a level of professionalism that aligns with the student government's representation of the university.
