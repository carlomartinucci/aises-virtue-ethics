In this situation, I would suggest that Claire implement a new system for the funding committee where Garret is recused from any decisions involving his own club's funding requests. This means that whenever his club's proposals are being discussed, Garret should step out of the room or otherwise not participate in the decision-making process. By doing this, Claire can ensure that there is no perceived bias in the allocation of funds to Garret's club.

Additionally, to address the issue of unequal funding distribution among clubs, Claire could propose a more transparent and objective criteria for evaluating funding requests. This could involve setting clear guidelines for how funding decisions are made, such as considering the club's impact on campus, the number of members benefiting, and the feasibility of the proposed activities. By having a more structured approach to evaluating funding requests, Claire can help ensure a fairer distribution of funds across all clubs and organizations.

Lastly, Claire could also consider introducing a cap on the amount of funding that a single club can receive within a certain time frame. This could help prevent any one club from dominating the funding allocation and ensure that resources are distributed more evenly among all student groups.

By taking these concrete steps, Claire can work towards making the funding allocation process more fair and transparent, while also addressing the potential conflict of interest involving Garret's club.
