Given the scenario, I would first gather all the relevant information about the situation, including the statements made by Mayor Schaaf, ICE officials, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and others. I would review the facts of the case to understand the implications of Mayor Schaaf's decision to announce the ICE raids.

Next, I would assess the potential consequences of Mayor Schaaf's actions, such as whether her announcement could have endangered law enforcement officers, whether it may have helped individuals with criminal records evade capture, and whether it caused unnecessary panic in the immigrant community.

After analyzing the situation, I would recommend that Mayor Schaaf provide a detailed explanation for her decision to announce the ICE raids, addressing concerns raised by ICE officials, law enforcement, and the community. This explanation should clarify her motivations, the sources of her information, and the reasoning behind her actions.

Furthermore, I would suggest that Mayor Schaaf work closely with relevant stakeholders, such as local law enforcement agencies, immigration organizations, and the immigrant community, to develop better communication strategies for future situations involving ICE raids. This could involve exploring alternative ways to disseminate information to affected communities while minimizing potential risks.

Lastly, I would advise Mayor Schaaf to seek legal counsel to ensure that her actions were in compliance with the law and to address any legal challenges that may arise from the Trump administration's lawsuit against California's sanctuary city laws.
