I would conduct a thorough review of the data-sharing agreement between Crisis Text Line and Loris.ai to understand the details of how the data was being used and shared. I would also examine the organization's policies and procedures regarding data privacy and consent to ensure that they align with ethical standards and best practices. Additionally, I would meet with the concerned volunteers to hear their perspectives and concerns firsthand, and work with them to address any issues or gaps in communication that may have led to the controversy. Finally, I would collaborate with the leadership team to establish clear guidelines and protocols for future data-sharing agreements to ensure that user consent is obtained in a meaningful and transparent manner.
