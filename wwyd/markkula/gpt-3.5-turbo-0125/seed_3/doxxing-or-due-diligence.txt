I would advise Andres to respect the student's request for anonymity in the article. Given the student's expressed concerns about facing social ostracization and potential condemnation from progressive students, it is crucial to prioritize his well-being and protect him from further harm. Andres should consider the student's vulnerability in this situation, where he did not anticipate the magnitude of the backlash he would receive for his post. Respecting the student's wish for confidentiality aligns with journalistic ethics, especially when the individual might face severe repercussions due to the publication of his name.
