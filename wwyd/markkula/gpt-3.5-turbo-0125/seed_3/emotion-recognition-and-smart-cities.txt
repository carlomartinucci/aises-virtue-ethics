I would first research the technology company and their reputation in handling sensitive data and privacy issues. I would then review the terms of the proposed agreement to ensure that the data sharing complies with all relevant laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection. If everything checks out, I would recommend setting up a meeting with city leaders to discuss the proposal in detail, including potential benefits, risks, and safeguards that need to be implemented to protect the privacy of the city's residents. I would also suggest involving legal experts to review and potentially draft a data sharing agreement to clearly outline the terms and responsibilities of both parties.
