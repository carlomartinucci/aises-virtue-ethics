I would conduct a thorough review of First Date's data privacy and security measures to ensure that user information is protected and that there are safeguards in place to prevent any potential breaches. I would also assess the accuracy and reliability of the avatar verification process to confirm that it is effective in matching user avatars with their provided photo IDs. Additionally, I would investigate the partnerships with online delivery services and content providers to understand how user data is shared and ensure that users are informed and consent to these collaborations.
