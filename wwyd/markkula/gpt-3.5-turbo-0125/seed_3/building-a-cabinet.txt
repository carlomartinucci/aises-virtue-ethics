In Marcus's position, I would take the following specific action: I would conduct individual interviews with each of the opposing candidates from the presidential election who expressed a willingness to take other positions. During these interviews, I would focus on assessing their motivations for seeking a position on the executive cabinet, their vision for the organization, and how they plan to contribute positively to the team despite the election outcome. I would also inquire about their willingness to set aside any resentments and work collaboratively with Marcus and his team for the benefit of the student government. Based on the interviews, I would then select the most suitable candidate for the third appointed spot on the executive cabinet, taking into consideration their qualifications, attitude, and potential impact on organizational unity and effectiveness.
