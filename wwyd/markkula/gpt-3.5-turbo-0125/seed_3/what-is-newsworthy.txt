I would advise Fatimah to have a discussion with her editorial team to evaluate the purpose and ethical implications of tweeting campus safety reports. During this discussion, they should consider the potential consequences of sharing these reports on social media, such as the impact on the reputation and well-being of the individuals involved. They should also assess whether the intention is to inform the campus community about safety issues or simply to generate engagement through entertaining content. Based on this evaluation, they can make an informed decision about whether to continue tweeting campus safety reports and how to do so in a responsible and ethical manner.
