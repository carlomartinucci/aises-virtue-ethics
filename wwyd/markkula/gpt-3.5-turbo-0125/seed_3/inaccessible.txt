I would immediately address the situation by advocating for Michelle's needs. I would speak to the physician and clinic management to emphasize the importance of providing proper accommodations for patients with disabilities. I would request that appropriate equipment, such as a height-adjustable exam table or a lift, be made available for future appointments. Additionally, I would recommend that the physician receive additional training on how to effectively examine and treat patients with mobility disabilities to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Finally, I would ensure that Michelle receives the necessary medical care and support for her current condition, including coordinating with specialists for her wound care and treatment.
