Given the scenario described, I would take the following specific actions: 

1. Conduct a thorough review of the features and capabilities of the smart lamppost technology deployed in Hong Kong to ensure that privacy concerns are being addressed appropriately.
2. Engage with stakeholders, including government officials, technology providers, privacy advocates, and the public, to gather feedback and concerns related to the smart lamppost program.
3. Work with cybersecurity experts to assess potential risks of data leaks and other security vulnerabilities associated with the smart lamppost infrastructure.
4. Develop clear guidelines and protocols for the responsible use of data collected by the smart lampposts to prevent misuse and protect individuals' privacy rights.
5. Implement transparency measures to communicate to the public how data collected by the smart lampposts is being used and stored, to build trust and address concerns about surveillance.
6. Collaborate with law enforcement agencies and legal experts to ensure that the deployment of smart lamppost technology complies with relevant privacy laws and regulations.
7. Monitor the situation closely and be prepared to make adjustments to the smart lamppost program based on ongoing feedback and developments in privacy and cybersecurity best practices.
