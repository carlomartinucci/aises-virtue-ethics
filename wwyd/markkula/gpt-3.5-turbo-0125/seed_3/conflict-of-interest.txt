If I were in Miguel's shoes, I would first have a direct and transparent conversation with both the outdoor club and Associated Students. I would explain the conflict of interest I am facing and express my concerns about maintaining neutrality and fairness in the decision-making process. 

Next, I would consider temporarily stepping back from my role in the outdoor club during the petitioning process to avoid any appearance of bias or favoritism. This would allow me to focus on my responsibilities within Associated Students and uphold the integrity of the organization. 

I would also work closely with other executive members of Associated Students to ensure that the petitioning process is fair, transparent, and free from any conflicts of interest. Seeking guidance from mentors or advisors within the organization could also help me navigate this challenging situation effectively. 

Overall, by openly addressing the conflict of interest, temporarily stepping back from the club, and seeking support from colleagues, I believe I can maintain my integrity and fulfill my duties within both organizations responsibly.
