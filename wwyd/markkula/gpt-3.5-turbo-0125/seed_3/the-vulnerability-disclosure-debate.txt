I would analyze the situation to understand the potential impact of disclosing vulnerabilities with exploit code before patches are available. I would consider the risks posed to users during the time between disclosure and patch release. I would also assess the implications for the relationship between Google and Microsoft, as well as the broader implications for the tech industry.

Based on this analysis, I would engage in discussions with both Google and Microsoft to facilitate communication and understanding between the two parties. I would encourage them to find common ground on responsible disclosure practices that prioritize user safety while also allowing sufficient time for developers to address vulnerabilities.

I would also consider the perspectives of security researchers and the general public on the matter to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the implications of different disclosure policies. Additionally, I would monitor the situation closely to identify any potential escalations or further vulnerabilities that may require attention.

Overall, my approach would be to foster constructive dialogue, promote collaboration, and advocate for responsible disclosure practices that prioritize user safety and the timely resolution of vulnerabilities.
