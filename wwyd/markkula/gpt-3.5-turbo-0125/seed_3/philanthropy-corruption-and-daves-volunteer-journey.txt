I would advise Dave to immediately stop the arrangement with Alex. Dave should report the illegal currency exchange practices of the non-profit managers to his organization's leadership and local authorities in the Dominican Republic. He should also seek guidance on how to properly handle donor funds and currency exchanges in compliance with local laws and regulations. It is crucial for Dave to prioritize transparency, integrity, and legality in managing the project's finances to ensure that the funds are used ethically and effectively for their intended purpose of helping the unhoused population.
