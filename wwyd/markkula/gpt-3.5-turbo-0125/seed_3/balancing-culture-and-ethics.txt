Ben should express his concerns about the child labor situation in a respectful and sensitive manner. He should acknowledge the positive impact the business development has had on the families in terms of additional income, but also emphasize the importance of prioritizing the well-being and safety of the children. Ben could suggest exploring alternative solutions that would allow the families to continue benefiting financially without having to rely on child labor, such as providing educational opportunities for the children or finding ways to support the families in a manner that doesn't involve exploiting child labor. Ben should offer his support and assistance in finding a more sustainable and ethical way forward for the community.
