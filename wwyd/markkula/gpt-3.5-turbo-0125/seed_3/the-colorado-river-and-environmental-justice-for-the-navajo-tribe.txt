I would advocate for the inclusion of the Navajo Nation in the water allocation decision-making processes related to the Colorado River. This would involve reaching out to relevant stakeholders, such as state legislators, federal agencies, and tribal leaders, to highlight the importance of considering the water rights and needs of the Navajo tribe in any agreements or plans for water allocation. I would work to ensure that the Navajo Nation is given a platform to voice their concerns, share their perspectives, and have a seat at the table during negotiations to address the environmental injustice they are facing in terms of water access. Additionally, I would support efforts to implement safe and reliable water sources for all members of the Navajo Nation, despite the Supreme Court's decision, by collaborating with organizations and policymakers to find sustainable solutions to improve water access on the reservation.
