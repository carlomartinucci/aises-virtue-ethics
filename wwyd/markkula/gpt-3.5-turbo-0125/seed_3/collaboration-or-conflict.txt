In Josh's position, I would schedule a face-to-face meeting with Alanna to express my concerns and discuss the issues openly. During the meeting, I would calmly outline the importance of the event and the benefits of the collaboration between student government and RHA over the past years. I would listen to Alanna's perspective and try to understand the reasons behind her lukewarm response and negative comments about student government. I would emphasize the urgency of the situation and the need for both organizations to work together to ensure the success of the event. I would propose a clear plan of action with specific deadlines and responsibilities for both student government and RHA members to follow in order to move forward with the event planning process effectively. I would also offer my assistance and support to Alanna and her team to address any challenges they may be facing in their busy schedule. Ultimately, my goal would be to find a solution that allows for a successful collaboration between student government and RHA while ensuring the high quality of the event for the student body.
