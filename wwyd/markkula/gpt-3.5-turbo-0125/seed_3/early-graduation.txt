I would advise Grace to have an open and honest conversation with the senior members of the student government about her situation. She should explain her plans to graduate early and the potential impact on the organization if she were to run and win as a senior class senator. Grace should seek their input and advice on how best to proceed, taking into consideration the needs of the student government and the importance of fulfilling commitments. Additionally, she should explore alternative ways to stay involved and contribute to the organization even after graduating early, such as serving in an advisory role or assisting with transition planning for the incoming student government.
