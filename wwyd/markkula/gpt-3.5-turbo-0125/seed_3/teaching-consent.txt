I would reach out to the sexual assault prevention center at the university to schedule a meeting with the staff in charge of creating the resources on consent. During the meeting, I would highlight the specific issue of the vague and non-universally applicable descriptions of consent in their materials, especially in relation to neurodiverse individuals. I would propose the need for clearer, more explicit guidelines that focus on verbal communication and clear boundaries to ensure that all individuals, including those who may struggle with interpreting non-verbal cues, can understand what consent means in social situations. I would offer to collaborate with them to revise the materials to be more inclusive and accessible for all students, regardless of their neurodiversity.
