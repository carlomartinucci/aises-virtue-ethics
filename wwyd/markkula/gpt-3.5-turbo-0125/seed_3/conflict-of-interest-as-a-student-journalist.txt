I would advise Nadia to disclose her involvement in the student organization dedicated to social activism and service learning to her editor, Christian. By being transparent about her connections to the organization and the protest, she can maintain her credibility as a journalist. This disclosure will allow Christian to make an informed decision about whether Nadia should be the one to write the story or if another journalist should be assigned to ensure impartiality in the reporting. Additionally, I would suggest that Nadia discuss her concerns about impartiality with Christian and work together to develop a plan to ensure a balanced and fair representation of all perspectives in the article.
