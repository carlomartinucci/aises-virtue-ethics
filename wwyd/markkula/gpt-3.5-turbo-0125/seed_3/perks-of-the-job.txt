I would schedule a private meeting with Julia to discuss the issue. During the meeting, I would respectfully explain to her the concerns about the misuse of office resources and how it is affecting the organization's budget. I would acknowledge her dedication and hard work for the organization but emphasize the importance of following the rules and policies in place regarding the use of office resources. I would suggest finding alternative solutions, such as using personal resources for her homework or seeking permission for occasional use of office supplies for personal tasks. I would offer my support in finding a resolution that is fair for both Julia and the organization.
