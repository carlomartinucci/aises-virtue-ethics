If I were in this situation, I would ensure that the app's TOS are strictly enforced by monitoring user-generated content for any scenarios that involve directing VR violence at humans. I would promptly remove any such content and take appropriate action, such as banning the user or creator responsible for violating the prohibition. Additionally, I would regularly review the content uploaded by users to ensure that it aligns with the guidelines and does not promote any harmful or inappropriate behavior. Finally, I would communicate with the users and creators to remind them of the rules and the importance of creating a safe and positive environment within the VR Rage Room app.
