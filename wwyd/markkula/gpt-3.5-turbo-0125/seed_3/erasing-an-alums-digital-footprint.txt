I would advise Analyssa to consider redacting Marcus's name from the article, given the potential negative impact it could have on his future job prospects. I would suggest explaining to Analyssa that while transparency is important, in this case, the consequences of not redacting the name outweigh the benefits of keeping it public. By removing Marcus's name, Analyssa can help him move forward without being unfairly judged for a mistake made many years ago. This action can also demonstrate the paper's willingness to consider the evolving implications of digital archives and protect individuals from outdated information that could harm their reputations.
