As Mary, I would first seek to have a candid and empathetic conversation with my brother, Donald, to understand his perspective and concerns better. I would emphasize the importance of finding a solution that considers the interests of all shareholders and maintains family harmony.

To address the issue of the buyout, I would propose exploring other alternatives to satisfy Donald's desire to exit the business without immediately resorting to selling the building. This could include negotiating a buyout amount that reflects the fair market value of his share while also considering the discount typically applied to minority shareholders. I would highlight the financial realities of the business and the potential impact of selling the building on all stakeholders, including the significant tax implications.

In terms of managing the building going forward, I would suggest a compromise solution that involves hiring external professionals to oversee the operations while preserving the long-term value of the asset. I would emphasize the importance of prudent financial management and the potential benefits of retaining ownership of the building for the family's future generations.

Regarding the potential vote on selling the building, I would advocate for open communication and consensus-building within the family to find a mutually agreeable solution. I would stress the need to consider the implications of any decision on both financial and personal levels, aiming to maintain family relationships while also safeguarding the business's interests.

Throughout this process, I would prioritize transparency, fairness, and open dialogue to navigate the complexities of family dynamics and business decisions. I would also seek guidance from legal and financial advisors to ensure that all options are explored thoroughly and that decisions are made with a clear understanding of their implications for all stakeholders involved.
