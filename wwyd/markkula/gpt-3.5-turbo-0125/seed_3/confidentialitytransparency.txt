As Akira, I would politely but firmly ask the senator to leave the meeting, emphasizing the need to protect Joshua's privacy and ensure a fair and confidential discussion on the matter. I would explain that discussing sensitive disciplinary issues in front of an audience, especially one involving a specific individual, could harm that person's reputation and violate their right to privacy. I would also express my commitment to transparency and assure the senator that the decision-making process will be conducted fairly and in line with established procedures.
