I would advise Jessica to prioritize Adam's safety and well-being above all else. Given the sensitive nature of the topic and the potential risks involved for Adam, it is crucial to respect his request for anonymity. Jessica should explain to Adam that his safety is her top priority and that she will honor his wish to keep his identity confidential in the article.

To address concerns about transparency and credibility, Jessica can mention in her article that the source's identity has been withheld to protect their safety due to the sensitive nature of the topic.
