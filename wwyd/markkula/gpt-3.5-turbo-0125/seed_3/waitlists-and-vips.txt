In Callie's situation, I would first acknowledge the mistake in data entry that resulted in five extra tickets. Then, I would immediately send out an email to the entire senior class explaining the error and offering the five tickets on a first-come, first-served basis. I would clearly communicate that this is a one-time opportunity for those who missed out on purchasing tickets earlier. 

To ensure fairness, I would set a specific time frame for responses, such as 24 hours, and inform the seniors that the first five students to reply to the email will be able to purchase the tickets. This approach would give all seniors an equal chance to attend Senior Ball and avoid any potential conflicts of interest that may arise from distributing the tickets only to Callie's friends. 

While managing the responses may require additional effort, it is crucial to prioritize fairness and inclusivity in this situation, even if it means taking time away from other event preparations.
