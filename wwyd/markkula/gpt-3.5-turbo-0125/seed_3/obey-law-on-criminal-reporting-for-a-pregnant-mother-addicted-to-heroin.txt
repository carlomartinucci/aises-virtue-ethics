I would have a detailed discussion with the patient about the legal implications of her drug use during pregnancy, including the mandatory reporting requirements in our state. I would explain the potential consequences of not seeking treatment, such as criminal charges and involvement of child protective services. 

I would emphasize the importance of her commitment to becoming drug-free for the well-being of her fetus and offer her support in accessing appropriate medical and social services. I would work with her to develop a comprehensive treatment plan that prioritizes her health and the health of her baby, while also considering the legal requirements.

I would encourage her to voluntarily enter an inpatient drug treatment program that provides medically-supported heroin withdrawal for both her and the fetus. I would also assure her that I am committed to supporting her throughout the process and that her best interests and those of her baby are my top priority.

I would closely monitor her progress during treatment and provide additional resources and support as needed. I would also ensure that she receives proper prenatal care to address any potential complications related to her drug use.

Ultimately, I would strive to balance the legal obligations with the patient's autonomy and well-being, aiming to provide compassionate and effective care that maximizes the chances of a positive outcome for both the patient and her baby.
