I would advise Hana to cover the story of the student's death in a respectful and responsible manner. She should focus on highlighting the positive aspects of the student's life, such as his involvement in campus activities and the impact he had on others. Hana should avoid sensationalizing the death or providing specific details about the suicide method. Instead, she should emphasize the importance of mental health awareness and resources available on campus. Additionally, including information about mental health helplines and support services can be beneficial for readers who may be struggling. Hana should also reach out to mental health professionals or organizations for input and guidance on how to address the topic sensitively.
