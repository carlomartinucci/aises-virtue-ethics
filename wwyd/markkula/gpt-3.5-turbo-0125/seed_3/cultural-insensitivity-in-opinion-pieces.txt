I would suggest that Jennifer have a conversation with Ishmael to express her concerns about the potentially culturally insensitive nature of his article on boba. Jennifer could explain how the comparison of boba tapioca to "frog eyes rolling in your mouth" may be offensive to some individuals within the school community who view boba as an important cultural symbol. Jennifer could propose that Ishmael consider revising his language to be more respectful and mindful of cultural sensitivities while still expressing his critique of the drink. By discussing these concerns with Ishmael, Jennifer can work towards finding a compromise that upholds both freedom of expression and cultural sensitivity in the article.
