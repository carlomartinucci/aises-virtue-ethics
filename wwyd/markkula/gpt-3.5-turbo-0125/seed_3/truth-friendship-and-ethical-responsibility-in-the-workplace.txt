I would advise Ben to prioritize the integrity and reputation of the company by disclosing all the information he knows about Michael's fraudulent activities to the internal investigation team. Ben should provide detailed accounts of what he discovered in the sales transactions and accounting records, including the fraudulent scheme orchestrated by Michael with the external company.

While Ben may feel conflicted about potentially jeopardizing his friendship with Michael or being seen as complicit in the fraudulent behavior, it is crucial for him to uphold ethical standards and corporate integrity. By providing full transparency to the company's investigation, Ben can demonstrate his commitment to honesty and accountability, which are essential values in any professional setting.

Additionally, by cooperating with the internal investigation and revealing the truth about Michael's actions, Ben can help ensure that appropriate measures are taken to address the financial harm caused by the fraudulent scheme. This will ultimately benefit the company and its stakeholders, including employees, customers, and shareholders, by upholding ethical standards and maintaining trust in the organization.

Ultimately, by choosing to disclose the information he knows and assist in the investigation, Ben can fulfill his responsibility as an employee to act in the best interests of the company and uphold ethical standards, even if it means facing difficult consequences or strains in his personal relationships.
