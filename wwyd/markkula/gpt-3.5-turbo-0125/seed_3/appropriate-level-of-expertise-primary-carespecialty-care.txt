I would explain to Peter that while I appreciate his trust in me, and while I will continue to support him to the best of my abilities, it is crucial for his well-being that he consult with a psychiatrist for a proper evaluation and potential treatment for any serious psychiatric disorder. I would emphasize that my role as a primary care physician is limited in managing complex psychiatric conditions like bipolar disorder, and that he would benefit from the expertise of a specialist in this area. I would offer to help him find a psychiatrist he feels comfortable with and accompany him to the appointment if needed. Additionally, I would reassure Peter that seeking help from a psychiatrist does not diminish the trust he has in me as his primary care physician, but rather complements the care he receives to ensure he gets the most appropriate treatment for his condition.
