I would recommend that Tyler prioritize his connection with his constituents by setting up regular office hours or open forums where students can directly share their concerns and issues with him. Tyler could also organize focus groups or surveys to gather feedback from students on specific topics that matter to them, such as housing after studying abroad. By actively listening and engaging with his constituents, Tyler can better understand their needs and represent them effectively. Additionally, Tyler could work on building relationships with student organizations or clubs to establish stronger ties with the diverse groups on campus. These actions would help Tyler maintain a balance between his committee work and his responsibilities to his constituents.
