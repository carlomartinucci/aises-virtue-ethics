I would schedule individual meetings with each board member to discuss their level of engagement with the organization and their commitment to its mission. During these meetings, I would emphasize the importance of active participation and the potential for growth if everyone works together towards common goals. I would also seek feedback from board members on how to improve board engagement and address any concerns they may have. Additionally, I would propose setting up a board development committee to focus on enhancing board involvement and effectiveness, as well as organizing regular training sessions to educate board members on their roles and responsibilities.
