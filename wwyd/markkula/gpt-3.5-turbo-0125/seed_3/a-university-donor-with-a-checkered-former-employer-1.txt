I would thank the donor for their interest in supporting the university and inquire about their specific motivations for wanting to donate. I would express appreciation for their desire to give back to the community. I would then diplomatically bring up the historical association of their previous employer with predatory lending practices during the 2008 recession, acknowledging that while they personally retired before those issues arose, the connection might raise concerns within the university community.

I would explain that the university is committed to upholding ethical standards and values, including a focus on diversity and inclusion in STEM education. I would respectfully ask the donor to provide more information about their personal values and commitment to social responsibility, to understand if their donation aligns with the university's mission and values. I would also suggest a meeting or further discussion to explore how their donation could support the university's goals for diversity in STEM education, while ensuring transparency and accountability.

Depending on the outcome of this conversation and any additional information gathered, I would consult with university leadership and the fundraising team to make an informed decision about whether to accept the donation. The decision would be made in consideration of the potential impact on the university's reputation, values, and commitment to diversity in STEM education.
