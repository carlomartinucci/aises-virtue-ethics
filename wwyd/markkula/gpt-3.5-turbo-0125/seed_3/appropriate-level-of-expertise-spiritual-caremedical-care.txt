I would schedule a meeting with John outside of his regular spiritual directing sessions to have a heart-to-heart conversation with him. During this meeting, I would express my deep concern for his well-being and emphasize that I am here to support him in any way I can. I would gently but firmly encourage him to consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in depression and addiction issues.

I would offer to help research and find resources for him, such as affordable therapy options or support groups that could provide the specific help he needs. I would assure him that seeking help is not a sign of weakness, but a courageous step towards taking care of himself and his family. I would also remind him that his health and well-being are of utmost importance, and that he deserves to receive the proper care and support during this challenging time.

Additionally, I would continue to pray for John and his family, and offer ongoing spiritual guidance and emotional support as he navigates through these difficulties. I would check in with him regularly to see how he is doing and encourage open communication about his feelings and struggles.
