I would review the company's policies on reinstatement and accommodations for employees with disabilities, including those on the Autism Spectrum. I would then schedule a meeting with relevant stakeholders, including HR, legal, and management, to discuss the situation and determine the appropriate course of action. During the meeting, I would carefully consider the impact of Matt's ASD on his behavior, the company's obligation to provide reasonable accommodations, and any potential legal implications. I would also gather information on Matt's performance history and behavior before the incident to make an informed decision on whether reinstatement is feasible and appropriate.
