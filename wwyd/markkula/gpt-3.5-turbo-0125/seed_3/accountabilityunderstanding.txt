I would schedule a private meeting with Jaime to discuss his recent behavior and the concerns raised by the other council members. During the meeting, I would express understanding and empathy towards his challenging quarter and overwhelming workload. I would listen to his perspective on the situation and explore potential solutions together, such as adjusting his responsibilities or seeking additional support.

At the same time, I would clearly communicate the importance of his commitment to the student government and the impact his absences and lack of communication are having on the team's effectiveness. I would set clear expectations for improvement moving forward and establish a plan for regular check-ins to monitor progress.

If Jaime continues to struggle with meeting his commitments despite our discussion and the agreed-upon plan, I would consider implementing a more formal disciplinary action, such as reducing his responsibilities or temporarily suspending him from the council, while still offering support and resources to help him succeed in his role.
