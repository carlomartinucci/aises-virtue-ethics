Given the concerns raised about bias in face detection and other issues with proctoring software, one specific action I would take is to conduct a thorough review of the proctoring software being used at the institution. This review would involve gathering feedback from students, professors, and technologists about their experiences and concerns with the software. Additionally, I would reach out to the companies that provide the proctoring software to discuss the steps they are taking to address the issues highlighted by critics.

Based on the feedback and discussions, I would then make an informed decision on whether to continue using the proctoring software or explore alternative solutions for maintaining academic integrity in online exams. This decision would be communicated transparently to all stakeholders involved, with a clear explanation of the reasons behind it.
