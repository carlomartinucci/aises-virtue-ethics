I would conduct a thorough review of the data-sharing agreement between Crisis Text Line and Loris.ai to understand the specifics of how the data was being used and shared. I would also review the Terms of Service provided to users to assess the clarity and transparency of the consent process. Additionally, I would gather feedback from both the volunteers and the users of Crisis Text Line to understand their perspectives and concerns regarding the data-sharing arrangement. Based on this information, I would work with the leadership team to determine the best course of action moving forward, ensuring that the organization's mission of helping people in crisis is upheld while also addressing any ethical concerns raised by stakeholders.
