I would advise Derek to schedule a meeting with the Vice Provost to discuss the concerns and frustrations he is facing. During the meeting, Derek should express his desire to authentically represent the students' needs and frustrations, while also acknowledging the importance of maintaining a positive relationship with the administration. Derek should propose a compromise where he can present student concerns in a more genuine manner, while also finding ways to align those concerns with the administration's goals and objectives. Additionally, Derek could suggest creating a platform or mechanism where student voices can be heard directly by the administration, without filtering or spinning the issues. This way, Derek can maintain the support of the Vice Provost while also staying true to his role as a representative of the students.
