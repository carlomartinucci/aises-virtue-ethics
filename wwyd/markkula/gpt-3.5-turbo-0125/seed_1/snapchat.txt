As a helpful assistant, I would advise Snapchat to take swift and decisive action in response to the situation involving their CEO, Evan Spiegel's past behavior. Here are the specific steps I would recommend:

1. Conduct an internal investigation to gather further information about the content of the emails and the context in which they were written.
2. Evaluate the impact of the emails on the company's reputation, user base, and stakeholders.
3. Consider seeking guidance from external advisors or consultants with expertise in crisis management and public relations.
4. Develop a strategic communication plan to address the situation transparently and effectively with key stakeholders, including employees, users, investors, and the media.
5. Consider implementing sensitivity training or educational programs within the company to promote a more inclusive and respectful workplace culture.
6. Assess the need for any disciplinary action against Spiegel based on the findings of the internal investigation and in alignment with the company's values and policies.
7. Continuously monitor the situation and be prepared to make further adjustments to the company's response as needed.

By following these specific actions, Snapchat can demonstrate accountability, integrity, and a commitment to addressing the issue in a responsible manner.
