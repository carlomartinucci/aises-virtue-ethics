I would convene a meeting with representatives from both student organizations and faculty members to discuss the issue. During the meeting, I would explain the concerns regarding the volume of emails and the potential impact on student engagement. I would propose a solution where faculty members could submit their information to be included in the weekly email newsletter, ensuring that students still receive their valuable information without overwhelming the email list. I would also suggest exploring alternative communication channels for faculty members to reach students, such as a dedicated section on the student government website or a designated bulletin board on campus. By involving all stakeholders in the discussion and proposing a compromise that addresses the concerns of both groups, I aim to find a resolution that maintains student engagement while also accommodating the needs of faculty members.
