I would suggest that Fatimah discuss her concerns with her editor or supervisor at the newspaper. She should express her reservations about the nature of the campus safety reports and the ethical implications of sharing such incidents on social media for the sake of increasing readership. Fatimah could recommend considering the potential impact on the individuals involved in these incidents and the overall message being sent to the student body. By having an open dialogue with her editor, they can collectively decide on the best course of action regarding the publication and promotion of campus safety reports on social media.
