I would advise James to reconsider his campaign tactics and make adjustments to level the playing field with Alix. Instead of renting several black Mercedes Benz sports cars to drive students to classes on Election Day, James could opt for a more inclusive and fair approach. He could consider using more modest transportation options, such as vans or buses, that do not require students to vote for his ticket in exchange for a ride. Additionally, James could reallocate some of his campaign funds to support Alix in enhancing her marketing reach, ensuring that both candidates have a more equal opportunity to engage with the student body. By taking these steps, James can demonstrate integrity and fairness in his campaign while still striving to run an effective and competitive race for the presidency.
