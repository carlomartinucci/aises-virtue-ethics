I would first gather all available information on the smart lamppost project in Hong Kong, including the features and capabilities of the technology, the concerns raised by protesters and privacy advocates, and the responses from government officials and companies involved in the project. 

Next, I would assess the potential privacy implications of the smart lampposts, considering the data collection capabilities mentioned in the articles, such as license-plate recognition and audiovisual surveillance. I would also look into any existing laws or regulations in Hong Kong that govern the use of surveillance technology in public spaces. 

Based on my findings, I would draft a report highlighting the privacy risks associated with the smart lamppost project and present it to relevant stakeholders, such as government officials, privacy advocates, and the company that decided to end its contract. In the report, I would recommend transparent communication with the public regarding the purpose and scope of data collection by the smart lampposts, as well as the implementation of strong cybersecurity measures to prevent unauthorized access to collected data. 

Lastly, I would suggest the establishment of an oversight committee to monitor the deployment and operation of smart lampposts in Hong Kong, ensuring that they are used in a manner that respects the privacy rights of citizens while still supporting the city's smart initiatives.
