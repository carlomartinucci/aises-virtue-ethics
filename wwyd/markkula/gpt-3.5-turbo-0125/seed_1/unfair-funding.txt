I would suggest that Claire implement a blind review process for funding requests submitted by all clubs, including the one led by Garret. This process would involve removing any identifying information about the submitting club or individual before the requests are reviewed by the committee. This way, the committee members would evaluate the proposals solely based on their merit and alignment with the funding criteria, without being influenced by their personal relationships or admiration for Garret.

Additionally, I would recommend that Claire establish clear guidelines for evaluating funding requests, outlining specific criteria that all clubs must meet in order to receive funding. This would help ensure that funding decisions are made fairly and consistently across all clubs, regardless of their association with Garret or any other influential member.

By implementing a blind review process and setting clear evaluation criteria, Claire can help promote fairness and transparency in the distribution of funds while also maintaining a positive relationship with Garret and the other committee members.
