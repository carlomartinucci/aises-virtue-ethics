I would schedule a meeting with Jerome to discuss his situation in more detail. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about his recent relapse and the need for more intensive treatment, such as inpatient care. I would explain the limited resources available and the challenges in securing a spot in an inpatient facility. I would also inquire about Jerome's willingness to commit to the program's guidelines and address any underlying issues that may have contributed to his relapse.

Based on the conversation and Jerome's level of motivation and commitment, I would consider providing him with another chance in the outpatient program, with the condition that he actively engages in additional support services, such as individual counseling and support groups. I would also explore alternative treatment options and resources that may be available to assist Jerome in his recovery journey.

Additionally, I would document Jerome's case thoroughly, including his history, treatment progress, and any recommendations for further care. I would collaborate with other healthcare professionals and community resources to ensure Jerome receives comprehensive care and support tailored to his needs.
