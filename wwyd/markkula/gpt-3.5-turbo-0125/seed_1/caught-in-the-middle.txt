In Karina's position, I would schedule a meeting with the Executive Cabinet and the Senate to facilitate a structured dialogue aimed at finding common ground on the attendance policy issue. I would encourage each side to present their perspectives in a respectful and constructive manner, emphasizing active listening and mutual understanding. I would work to mediate the discussion, highlighting areas of agreement and exploring potential compromises that could address the concerns raised by both parties. Additionally, I would recommend establishing a task force comprised of members from both branches to collaboratively review and revise the attendance policy proposal to reflect the diverse viewpoints within the organization.
