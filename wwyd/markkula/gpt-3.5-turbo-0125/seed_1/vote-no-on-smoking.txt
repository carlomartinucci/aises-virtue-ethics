In Talia's position, I would first gather more information on the potential consequences of both implementing the smoking ban and not implementing it. I would reach out to legal experts, public health officials, and student advocacy groups to get a comprehensive understanding of the issue.

Next, I would communicate with my constituency to explain the concerns raised by the university administration and the potential legal implications of the ban. I would present all sides of the argument in a transparent and unbiased manner to ensure that my fellow students have all the necessary information to make an informed decision.

After gathering all the necessary information and consulting with relevant stakeholders, I would hold a town hall meeting or open forum to allow students to voice their opinions and concerns about the smoking ban. I would facilitate a constructive dialogue and encourage a respectful exchange of ideas.

Based on the feedback received from the town hall meeting, the information gathered from experts, and the concerns raised by the university administration, I would make an informed decision on whether to support or oppose the smoking ban. I would prioritize the well-being and rights of all students while considering the legal implications and potential impact on campus culture.

Ultimately, I would vote based on what I believe is in the best interest of the student body as a whole, even if it means going against the wishes of my immediate constituency. I would explain my decision thoroughly and transparently to my fellow students, emphasizing that my goal is to represent their interests to the best of my ability.
