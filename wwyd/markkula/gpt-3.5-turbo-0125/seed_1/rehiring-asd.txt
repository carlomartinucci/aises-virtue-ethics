I would conduct a thorough investigation into the incident, considering all available information and perspectives. I would review the details of the inappropriate comment made by Matt and the impact it had on the female employee. I would also assess the company's sexual harassment policy and how it was violated in this specific instance. Additionally, I would review any past performance evaluations or feedback regarding Matt's conduct in the workplace.

Next, I would meet with Matt to discuss his ASD disclosure and understand his reasons for not disclosing it earlier. I would seek to comprehend how his diagnosis may have influenced his behavior and decision-making in this situation. I would also consider any relevant laws or regulations related to accommodating employees with disabilities, such as ASD.

Based on the findings from the investigation and the discussion with Matt, I would present a recommendation to the company regarding the potential reinstatement of Matt. This recommendation would take into account the severity of the incident, the impact on the female employee, the company's policies, and any accommodations that could be made for an employee with ASD.

Ultimately, I would strive to reach a fair and just resolution that considers the well-being of all parties involved and upholds the company's values and policies.
