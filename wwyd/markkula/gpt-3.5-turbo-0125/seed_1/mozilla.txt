I would acknowledge Brendan Eich's resignation as CEO and the reasons behind it, recognizing the impact it has had on the organization and its stakeholders. I would work with the board and senior leadership to communicate openly and transparently with employees, contributors, and the wider community about the situation, emphasizing the organization's commitment to its values and mission. I would also support efforts to review and strengthen existing policies and practices related to diversity, inclusion, and alignment with the values of the Mozilla Manifesto to ensure a positive and inclusive workplace culture going forward.
