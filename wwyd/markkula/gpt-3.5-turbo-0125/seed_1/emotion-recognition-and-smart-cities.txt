I would conduct a thorough analysis of the potential benefits and risks of this proposal. This would involve examining the accuracy and reliability of the emotion-recognition AI, assessing the potential privacy implications for the residents being filmed, and considering the long-term implications of allowing a private company access to such sensitive data. Following this analysis, I would present a detailed report outlining the findings to city leaders, along with recommendations on whether to proceed with the proposal or not. Additionally, I would consult with legal experts to ensure that the proposed arrangement complies with relevant laws and regulations regarding data privacy and surveillance.
