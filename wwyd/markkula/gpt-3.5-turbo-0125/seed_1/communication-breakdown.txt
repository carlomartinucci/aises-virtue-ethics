I would advise Derek to schedule a one-on-one meeting with the Vice Provost to discuss the situation regarding the off-campus thefts affecting fraternity and sorority members. During the meeting, Derek should present the facts and emphasize the significant impact these incidents are having on a large portion of the student body. He should express the importance of addressing these issues to maintain trust and credibility with the student body.

Derek should also propose potential solutions or actions that the university could take to support the affected students, while highlighting the benefits of addressing these issues in terms of student well-being and campus safety. By approaching the Vice Provost directly and advocating for the needs of the students in a respectful and constructive manner, Derek may be able to bridge the gap between the student government's initiatives and the administration's goals.
