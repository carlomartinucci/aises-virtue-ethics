In this situation, I would advise Drake to maintain a professional boundary with his friend Alex and avoid meeting to review the proposal personally. Instead, he should encourage Alex to utilize the online resources and tip guides provided by the Associated Students organization to craft a strong proposal. By doing so, Drake ensures that all student clubs and societies have equal access to information and resources, promoting fairness in the funding process. If Alex expresses disappointment or frustration, Drake can explain his decision by emphasizing the importance of impartiality and fairness in the allocation of funds to student organizations.
