I would express to John my concerns about his well-being and the potential risks associated with his recent behavior, including the decision to have a drink after 20 years of sobriety. I would strongly encourage him to seek professional help from a counselor or therapist who is qualified to address his mental health and substance abuse concerns. I would offer to help him find a suitable professional and provide him with resources and support to access the help he needs. Additionally, I would continue to offer spiritual guidance and prayers for him during this challenging time, while emphasizing the importance of addressing his mental health and addiction issues with appropriate professional assistance.
