I would arrange a meeting with Kyle's parents, his current teachers, and the admissions staff at Eminent Scholars to discuss their concerns and explore potential solutions. During the meeting, I would suggest a hybrid model that combines the personalized learning approach of Eminent Scholars with opportunities for social interaction and skill development at his current school or through extracurricular activities. This way, Kyle can benefit from the tailored education while still having chances to work on his social skills and interact with peers. Additionally, I would propose setting up regular progress reviews to assess Kyle's development and make any necessary adjustments to ensure he is thriving both academically and socially.
