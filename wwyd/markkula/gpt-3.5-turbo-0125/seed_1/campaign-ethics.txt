In Olivia's position, I would first consult with a trusted mentor or advisor within the university to discuss my concerns about the timing of implementing the initiatives and events for the Community Relations Branch in relation to the upcoming election. I would seek their guidance on whether my actions could be perceived as unfair or unethical given that I am using my current position to potentially gain an advantage in the election.

Additionally, I would consider conducting a self-assessment to reflect on my motivations for implementing these initiatives and events. I would ask myself whether my primary goal is truly to benefit the student body and improve the university community, or if my intentions are primarily focused on boosting my own public appeal and chances of winning the election.

Lastly, I would consider being transparent about my intentions with the other members of ASI and seek their feedback on the situation. By opening up a dialogue and discussing my concerns with my colleagues, I could gain valuable perspectives on the ethical implications of my actions and potentially make adjustments to ensure fairness and integrity in the election process.
