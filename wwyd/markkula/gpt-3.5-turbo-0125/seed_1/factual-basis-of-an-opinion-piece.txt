I would advise Elena to fact-check the article thoroughly to verify the accuracy of the claims made by Jack regarding the university's affirmative action policies. If it is confirmed that the university does not practice affirmative action in its admissions process, I would recommend that Elena have a conversation with Jack to discuss the discrepancy between his claims and the actual university policy.

During this conversation, Elena could explain the importance of factual accuracy in journalism and the responsibility to provide readers with truthful information. Elena could suggest that Jack revise his article to reflect this new information or provide evidence to support his original claims.

If Jack is unable to provide evidence to support his claims or refuses to revise the article, Elena may need to make the difficult decision not to publish the piece. In this case, Elena should communicate her decision to Jack clearly, emphasizing the importance of maintaining journalistic integrity and the need to avoid spreading misinformation.

While some may view this decision as limiting Jack's freedom of speech, Elena can explain that journalistic standards require a commitment to accuracy and truthfulness. She can also emphasize that alternative perspectives are valuable, but they must be based on facts and evidence to ensure a constructive and informed debate.
