I would schedule a meeting with the other members of the University Affairs Committee to discuss the possibility of reallocating some of the workload to other committee members. During the meeting, I would explain my concerns about feeling disconnected from the student body and the importance of representing their needs accurately. I would propose a solution where I could delegate some of my current projects to others in order to free up time to focus on directly engaging with students to better understand their concerns and needs. By involving the committee in this discussion, I would aim to find a balance between fulfilling my responsibilities to the committee and to my constituents.
