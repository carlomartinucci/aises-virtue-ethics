I would schedule a meeting with Julia to discuss the issue privately. During the meeting, I would calmly and respectfully explain to her the importance of adhering to the organization's policies regarding the use of office resources and supplies. I would express my concerns about the impact of her actions on the organization's budget and the potential consequences it may have on other student programs. I would also emphasize the need for all members to set a positive example for the rest of the student government.

I would suggest finding alternative solutions that could help reduce costs, such as utilizing online resources instead of printing large reading packets. I would offer my assistance in exploring these options and finding ways to balance her personal needs with the organization's budget constraints.

Ultimately, I would aim to approach the situation with understanding and collaboration, seeking to find a resolution that upholds the organization's values while also preserving the working relationship with Julia.
