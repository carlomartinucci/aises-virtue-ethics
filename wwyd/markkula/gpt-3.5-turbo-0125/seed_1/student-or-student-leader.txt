I would first speak with the two affected senators individually to discuss the situation and understand their perspectives. I would inquire if there are any alternative solutions they have in mind or if they have any ideas on how to address this issue. 

Next, I would consult with the Senate as a whole to present the problem and seek input from other members on potential solutions. This could involve brainstorming ways to ensure the concerns of the constituents are still adequately represented despite the senators missing meetings. 

One possible solution could be to designate alternate representatives for the constituents of the two senators who have class during the Senate meeting time. These alternate representatives could attend the meetings on behalf of the absent senators and provide updates and feedback to them afterward. This way, the concerns of the constituents can still be heard and addressed even if the senators are unable to physically attend the meetings. 

I would also explore the option of adjusting the attendance policy for these specific circumstances, given the unique constraints faced by the senators. This could involve proposing an exception to the policy for these two individuals, considering their dedication and commitment to the organization. 

Ultimately, the goal would be to find a solution that ensures the effective functioning of the Senate while also taking into account the individual circumstances of the senators involved.
