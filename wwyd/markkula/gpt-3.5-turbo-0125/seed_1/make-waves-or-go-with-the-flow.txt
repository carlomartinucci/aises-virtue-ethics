I would suggest that Claire and her team members should have an open and honest discussion about the situation. They should address the concerns about the unrealistic budgeted hours for the audit engagement and the pressure to be more efficient without clear guidance on how to achieve it. They should collectively express their difficulties in completing the work within the proposed hours and seek clarity on how to proceed.

Furthermore, I would advise Claire and her team members to document their concerns and discussions with their manager, Ted, and seek clarification on whether the time spent on the audit should be charged fully or if there are specific guidelines on how to allocate their time between client work, training, and administrative tasks.

In regards to the training sessions planned for the weekend, I would recommend that Claire and her team members clearly communicate with their manager, Fred, about their plan to complete the required training outside of regular working hours. They should seek guidance on whether this time should be charged to training or if there are any specific protocols to follow for off-site training sessions.

Overall, open communication and seeking clarification from their superiors would be crucial for Claire and her team to navigate this challenging situation effectively.
