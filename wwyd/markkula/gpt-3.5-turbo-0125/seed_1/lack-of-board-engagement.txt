I would schedule one-on-one meetings with each board member to discuss their level of engagement, their commitment to the organization's mission, and their willingness to actively participate in board activities. During these meetings, I would clearly communicate the expectations for board members in terms of attendance, participation, and support for fundraising efforts. I would seek input on how to increase board engagement and solicit suggestions for improvements.

Based on the feedback received during these meetings, I would work with the board chair to implement strategies to increase board engagement, such as restructuring board meetings to be more interactive and engaging, providing ongoing training and development opportunities for board members, and establishing clear performance expectations and accountability measures. I would also explore the possibility of recruiting new board members who are passionate about the organization's mission and have the skills and networks to help advance its goals.

Additionally, I would work with staff to boost morale by fostering open communication, recognizing their hard work and dedication, and involving them in decision-making processes to increase their sense of ownership and empowerment within the organization. I would also explore opportunities for staff professional development and team-building activities to strengthen their commitment to the organization's mission.
