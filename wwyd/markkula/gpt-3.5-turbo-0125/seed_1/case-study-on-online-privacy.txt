As a response to the scenario, I would conduct thorough research on the efficacy and potential risks of implementing facial recognition technology and social media monitoring tools in educational settings. This research would involve studying case studies, consulting with experts in the field of technology and education, and reviewing any available data on the impact of such tools on student safety and well-being. Additionally, I would seek feedback from students, parents, and school administrators to gauge their concerns and perspectives on the matter. Based on this research, I would present a comprehensive report to school leadership outlining the potential benefits and drawbacks of using these technologies, along with recommendations for alternative strategies to enhance school safety without compromising student privacy and autonomy.
