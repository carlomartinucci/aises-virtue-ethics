Given the scenario described, I would take the following specific action:

I would recommend that MetLife update their disclosure practices to include information about the specific data points and analysis conducted by the Cogito software during phone interactions. This would involve clearly informing callers that their voice, tone, and conversation patterns are being monitored and analyzed in real-time to provide feedback to call-center agents. This level of transparency is crucial to ensure that customers are fully informed about the extent of data collection and analysis occurring during their calls.
