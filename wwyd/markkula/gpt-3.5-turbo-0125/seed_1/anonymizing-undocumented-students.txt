In this situation, I would advise Jessica to prioritize Adam's safety and well-being by respecting his request to keep his name anonymous in the article. To maintain transparency and credibility with her readers, Jessica can explain in the article why Adam's identity is being withheld, emphasizing the importance of protecting vulnerable individuals in sensitive situations like this.

Furthermore, Jessica can seek guidance from her school news editor, Anthony, to discuss alternative ways to verify the authenticity of Adam's story without compromising his anonymity. Anthony may provide additional support and insight on how to handle such delicate situations while upholding journalistic integrity. Jessica can also consider including other sources or data to corroborate Adam's experiences and provide a comprehensive view of the issue.

By prioritizing Adam's safety, while also being transparent with her readers and seeking guidance from her editor, Jessica can navigate the ethical considerations of using anonymous sources in her article about the school's sanctuary status with integrity and responsibility.
