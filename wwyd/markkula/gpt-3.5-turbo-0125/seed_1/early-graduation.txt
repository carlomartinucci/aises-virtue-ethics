I would advise Grace to have a transparent conversation with the senior members of the student government about her situation. She should explain her predicament honestly, outlining her passion for the organization, her desire to run for the senior class senator position, and her impending early graduation. Grace should seek input from the senior members on how to navigate this challenge, discussing potential solutions such as finding a temporary replacement for the spring quarter or determining if there are alternative ways for her to contribute to the organization after her graduation.

Grace should also communicate openly with her potential future constituents in the senior class about her graduation plans. She should outline her commitment to fulfilling her duties to the best of her ability for the two quarters she will be able to serve if elected, while also being transparent about the situation that may arise in the spring due to her early graduation. This will allow the senior class members to make an informed decision when voting for their senator.

Overall, Grace should prioritize honesty and open communication in addressing her situation with both the senior members of the student government and the senior class constituents to ensure transparency and collaboration in finding a suitable resolution.
