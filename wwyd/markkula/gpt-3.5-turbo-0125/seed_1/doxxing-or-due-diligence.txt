I would advise Andres to weigh the ethical considerations and potential consequences carefully before making a decision. He should consider the impact of publishing the student's name on his safety and well-being, especially given the backlash the student has already faced. Andres should also think about the journalistic integrity of the newspaper and how redacting the student's name may impact the credibility of the article. Ultimately, I would recommend that Andres consult with his editor or a senior staff member to discuss the situation and determine the best course of action that upholds ethical standards while also considering the student's request for anonymity.
