I would recommend that IBM immediately take down the Diversity in Faces (DiF) dataset from public access on their website. They should also send out a public statement acknowledging the concerns raised about the dataset's creation and distribution, and commit to conducting a thorough review of their data collection practices for future projects involving sensitive information. Additionally, IBM should proactively reach out to the photographers whose images were included in the dataset to offer transparency about how their photos were used and provide options for removal if desired.
