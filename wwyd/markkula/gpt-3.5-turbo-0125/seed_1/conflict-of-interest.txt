If I were in Miguel's shoes, I would prioritize my role on the student government and step down from the executive position in the outdoor club for the time being. I would communicate openly and honestly with the club members about my decision, emphasizing the importance of maintaining neutrality and avoiding conflicts of interest. I would assure them that stepping down does not diminish my support for the club or its goals, but rather demonstrates my commitment to upholding ethical standards in both roles. I would offer to support the club in other capacities, such as providing guidance or mentorship to the new leadership team, to ensure a smooth transition during my absence.
