In the context of the Zika outbreak in Brazil, I would recommend the following specific actions:

1. Conduct thorough research and consultation with experts in ecology, entomology, and public health to assess the potential impacts of releasing genetically modified mosquitoes into the environment in Brazil.
2. Collaborate with local environmental organizations and stakeholders to gather input and address concerns regarding the potential consequences of eliminating the native mosquito population.
3. Implement a pilot study in a controlled environment to monitor the effects of releasing genetically modified mosquitoes before scaling up to a larger intervention.
4. Develop a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plan to track the long-term effects on biodiversity, including the populations of predator species like bats and the impact on pollination of native flora.
5. Engage in open and transparent communication with the public, including pregnant women and local communities, about the risks and benefits of the proposed intervention to combat Zika.
6. Continuously evaluate and adapt the mosquito control strategy based on emerging scientific evidence and feedback from stakeholders to minimize unintended consequences on the ecosystem.

These specific actions aim to address the immediate public health concern of the Zika outbreak in Brazil while also considering the potential ecological impacts of releasing genetically modified mosquitoes into the environment.
