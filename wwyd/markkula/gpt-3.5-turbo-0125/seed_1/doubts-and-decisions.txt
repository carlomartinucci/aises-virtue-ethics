I would schedule a meeting with the President and Vice President to express my gratitude for the offer of the Director of Marketing position. During the meeting, I would honestly communicate my passion for the areas of Leadership Development, Community Service, and Women's Affairs, and explain how those positions align more closely with my interests and goals for personal growth within the organization. I would also mention that I value the input of the President and Vice President in recognizing my potential contributions to student government, but emphasize that I believe I would be able to make a greater impact in the positions I initially applied for. Additionally, I would suggest exploring ways to improve marketing efforts within the organization while still being able to pursue my passion in other areas.
