I would continue to express my concerns about the possibility of bi-polar disorder to Peter, emphasizing that it is important to seek a specialist's evaluation for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. I would explain the limitations of my expertise in treating serious psychiatric disorders and the potential risks of not receiving proper care. I would encourage Peter to reconsider seeing a psychiatrist and offer to help him find a trusted mental health professional who could provide the necessary support and expertise. If Peter remains adamant about not seeing a psychiatrist, I would document our discussions thoroughly in his medical records and continue to monitor his symptoms closely, while also exploring potential alternative options for support and care within my scope of practice.
