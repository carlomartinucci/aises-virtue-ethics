I would conduct a thorough review of the information available regarding Mayor Schaaf's decision to announce the ICE raids, including the statements made by both critics and supporters. I would analyze the potential consequences of her actions, such as the detainment of suspected undocumented immigrants and the criticism from various parties. Based on this analysis, I would identify any potential missteps or violations of laws or ethical guidelines that may have occurred.

Additionally, I would seek clarity on the role of a sanctuary city and the legal boundaries of government officials in providing warnings or interfering with federal immigration enforcement policies. This would involve consulting legal experts or relevant authorities to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the legal framework governing these issues.

Furthermore, I would assess the credibility of the information provided by ICE officials, particularly in light of James Schwab's resignation and claims of misleading statements. Understanding the accuracy of the information presented is crucial in evaluating the impact of Mayor Schaaf's actions and the subsequent criticism.

Finally, I would consider the broader implications of the Trump administration's lawsuit against California over its sanctuary city laws. Understanding the legal and political context surrounding this lawsuit would provide valuable insights into the ongoing debate over immigration policies and the role of local governments in enforcing or resisting federal mandates.
