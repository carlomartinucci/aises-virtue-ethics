In this scenario, I would first recommend that Carlos explore alternative funding options for the retreat. He could consider reaching out to potential sponsors or partners who may be willing to contribute financially in exchange for recognition or involvement in the retreat activities. Additionally, Carlos could look into fundraising initiatives within the student government organization to help offset the increased cost of the retreat.

If after exhausting these options, Carlos still finds it necessary to use funds from the greater student government budget to cover the retreat cost, I would suggest that he communicate transparently with the student body about the decision. Carlos should explain the importance of the retreat in enhancing the effectiveness of student government members and how this ultimately benefits the student body as a whole. By emphasizing the long-term impact of the retreat on the organization's ability to serve the student body, Carlos can help garner understanding and support for the decision to reallocate funds.
