Given the scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Conduct an immediate review of all existing supplier contracts in countries where child labor accusations have been made, such as Nepal, Bangladesh, and India.
2. Implement a strict policy requiring regular and surprise inspections at production sites to monitor and prevent the use of child labor.
3. Develop a comprehensive training program for all buyers and employees involved in supply chain management to raise awareness about child labor issues and ensure compliance with relevant legislation.
4. Collaborate with local authorities and non-governmental organizations in affected countries to address the root causes of child labor and support initiatives that provide alternatives for families relying on child labor.
5. Publicly acknowledge the issue of child labor in the supply chain, apologize for any past wrongdoing, and communicate transparently about the steps being taken to rectify the situation and prevent future occurrences.
