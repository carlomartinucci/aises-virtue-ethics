In Josh's position, I would arrange a meeting with Alanna in person to discuss the concerns and issues surrounding the collaboration for the upcoming fair. During the meeting, I would express the importance of the event for the student body and the history of successful collaborations between student government and RHA. I would try to understand Alanna's perspective and reasons for the lukewarm response and negative comments about student government.

I would propose a clear plan of action and timeline for the necessary tasks that need to be completed for the event, highlighting the benefits of working together efficiently. I would emphasize the shared goals of creating a successful fair and maintaining the positive relationship between the two organizations.

If Alanna remains uncooperative or unwilling to engage in productive discussions, I would suggest involving a neutral third-party mediator, such as a faculty advisor or a staff member from the student affairs department, to help facilitate communication and find a mutually acceptable solution. It is important to exhaust all possible avenues for collaboration before considering ending the partnership.

Ultimately, my goal would be to find a resolution that ensures the successful planning and execution of the fair while preserving the long-standing positive relationship between student government and RHA.
