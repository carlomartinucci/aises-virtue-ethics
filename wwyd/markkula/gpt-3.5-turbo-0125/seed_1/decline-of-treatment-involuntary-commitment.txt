I would first ensure Julia's immediate safety by removing the unopened bottle of powerful pain medication from her possession. I would then conduct a thorough assessment of her current mental health status, including exploring her history of depressive symptoms, any suicidal thoughts or plans, and any past suicide attempts. I would also inquire about her support system and coping strategies.

Given Julia's reluctance to involve her parents or commit to seeing her regular doctor, I would respect her autonomy as an adult and maintain confidentiality unless there is an imminent risk of harm to herself or others. However, I would emphasize the importance of seeking ongoing mental health support and provide her with information on local crisis hotlines and mental health resources.

I would engage in a collaborative discussion with Julia to better understand her concerns about past treatment experiences and explore alternative treatment options that may be more tolerable for her. It is crucial to build trust and rapport with her to encourage ongoing engagement in mental health care.

Additionally, I would document the assessment findings, treatment recommendations, and follow-up plan in Julia's medical record, ensuring that she has access to this information and understands the importance of seeking help in times of crisis.
