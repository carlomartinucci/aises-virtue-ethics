I would address the client's fantasy of stalking Susan and her new boyfriend by clearly explaining the potential consequences of such actions, both legally and emotionally. I would emphasize the importance of respecting boundaries and seeking healthier ways to cope with rejection and feelings of jealousy. I would explore with the client the underlying emotions that are driving this desire to scare Susan and her boyfriend, and work on developing alternative coping strategies, such as practicing mindfulness, engaging in hobbies, or seeking social support. Additionally, I would assess the client's risk for harm to self or others and develop a safety plan if necessary.
