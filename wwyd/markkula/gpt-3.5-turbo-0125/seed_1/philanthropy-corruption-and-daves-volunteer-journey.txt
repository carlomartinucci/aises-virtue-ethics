I would advise Dave to immediately cease the arrangement with Alex. Dave should report the illegal currency exchange activities of the non-profit to his organization's management and local authorities in the Dominican Republic. He should provide any evidence he has of the illegal activities, such as records of the currency exchanges and testimonies from individuals involved. Dave should also seek guidance from his organization's legal team on how to proceed and ensure that proper actions are taken to rectify the situation and prevent further illegal activities.
