I would prioritize Sophie's well-being and mental health by providing her with the appropriate medical care and support she needs. I would explain to Sophie the importance of honesty and transparency in medical records, as well as the potential consequences of not accurately documenting her medical history. I would discuss the risks and benefits of different treatment options with her, including antidepressants and therapy, and emphasize the importance of comprehensive care for her depression.

I would also reassure Sophie that seeking help for mental health issues is a sign of strength and courage, and that she should not feel ashamed or stigmatized. I would encourage her to consider the long-term implications of her decisions regarding her medical records, especially in relation to her future medical career and licensing.

Ultimately, I would work with Sophie to develop a treatment plan that takes into account her concerns about her medical history and future career aspirations, while also ensuring that she receives the best possible care for her mental health.
