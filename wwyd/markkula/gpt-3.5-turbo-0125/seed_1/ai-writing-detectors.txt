I would carefully review the latest research findings and articles on AI detection tools, paying particular attention to their accuracy rates, especially in cases involving non-native English speakers. I would then collaborate with educators, administrators, and experts in the field to assess the reliability and fairness of Turnitin's AI detection feature, considering the potential impact on student engagement and motivation. Additionally, I would explore alternative methods or strategies to address the issue of AI-generated text in student assignments, such as promoting academic integrity through education and fostering a culture of originality in academic work.
