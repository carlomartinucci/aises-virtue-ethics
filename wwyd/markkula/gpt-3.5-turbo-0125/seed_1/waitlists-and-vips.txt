In Callie's situation, I would immediately rectify the errors in data entry and ensure that the five remaining tickets are fairly distributed to those seniors who were initially turned away due to the mistakes. I would create a simple online form where interested seniors can quickly express their desire to attend Senior Ball and randomly select five individuals from that pool to receive the tickets. This method would be efficient, fair, and would not require Callie to individually choose who gets the tickets among her friends or other seniors. By taking this action, Callie can uphold the integrity of the ticket distribution process while also prioritizing her event preparation tasks.
