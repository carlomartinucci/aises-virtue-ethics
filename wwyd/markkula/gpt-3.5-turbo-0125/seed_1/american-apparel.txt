Given the situation with American Apparel and Dov Charney, I would first review the company's current code of conduct and policies regarding ethical practices and workplace behavior. I would then conduct a thorough investigation into any ongoing or past instances of sexual harassment, misconduct, or unethical behavior within the company to ensure a safe and respectful work environment for all employees.

I would also work closely with the newly appointed board directors and management team to implement and enforce strict policies and procedures to prevent any future incidents of misconduct or harassment. This may include mandatory training sessions for all employees on appropriate workplace behavior, clear reporting mechanisms for any concerns or complaints, and regular monitoring to ensure compliance with the company's ethical standards.

Additionally, I would review the company's marketing and advertising strategies to ensure they align with ethical practices and do not exploit or objectify individuals. If necessary, I would recommend changes to the marketing approach to promote a positive and inclusive brand image that resonates with customers while upholding ethical values.

Overall, my focus would be on creating a culture of integrity and respect within the company, fostering innovation and passion for the clothing industry while maintaining ethical standards in all aspects of the business operations.
