I would review the university's current data collection and analysis practices to ensure that student data is being handled in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). I would also assess the transparency of the process and evaluate whether students are adequately informed about how their data is being used and shared. Additionally, I would consider the ethical implications of using student data in predictive analytics and retention efforts, taking into account the need to balance the potential benefits for students with their right to privacy. If necessary, I would recommend implementing measures to enhance transparency and provide students with the option to opt out of certain data collection practices.
