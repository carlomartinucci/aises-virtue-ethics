I would advise Nadia to disclose her involvement in the student organization dedicated to social activism and service learning at the beginning of the article. By being transparent about her affiliations, she can maintain credibility with her readers and demonstrate her commitment to ethical journalism. This disclosure would help readers understand any potential biases and make their own informed judgments about the article's objectivity. Additionally, I would encourage Nadia to remain diligent in her reporting by seeking diverse perspectives, verifying information rigorously, and ensuring that the article presents a balanced view of the issue.
