I would advise Angela to disclose her conflict of interest to the rest of the student senate before the meeting. She should explain her personal relationship with Emily and the Hawaiian cultural club, and how this may impact her decision-making process. By being transparent about her conflict of interest, Angela can allow the other senators to consider this information when making their own decisions about the funding requests. This way, the senate can collectively decide how to proceed in a fair and informed manner.
