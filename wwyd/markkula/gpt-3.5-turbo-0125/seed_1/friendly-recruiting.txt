I would first review the applications of the remaining candidates to see if any of them have any relevant experience or skills that could potentially make them suitable for the committees needing representation. If there are candidates who show promise but may need additional training or support, I would consider providing them with resources to help them fulfill their roles effectively.

If after careful review I still believe that the remaining candidates may not be the best fit for the specific committees, I would reach out to the candidates individually to discuss their interests, strengths, and potential for growth in the roles they have been assigned to. I would offer guidance and support to help them prepare for their responsibilities and ensure they have the tools needed to succeed.

In parallel, I would also approach my friends and encourage them to apply for the positions on the committees where they are a good fit. I would explain the importance of having the right expertise and perspective on each committee and invite them to formally apply through the regular process.

Ultimately, my goal would be to ensure that the university committees have the most qualified and dedicated student representatives while also providing opportunities for growth and development to all candidates, including those who may not initially seem like the perfect match for the roles.
