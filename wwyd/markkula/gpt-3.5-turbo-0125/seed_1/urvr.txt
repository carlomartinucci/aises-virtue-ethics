I would ensure that all employees are trained on the proper handling of user data and privacy protection measures, including the importance of deleting 360 degree videos and images within the specified time frame. I would also conduct regular audits to verify that the data deletion process is being followed correctly. Additionally, I would work with the technical team to implement strong encryption measures to protect user data while it is stored on the servers, even if only temporarily.
