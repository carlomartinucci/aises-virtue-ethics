Tim should firmly refuse the bribe and the altered agreement presented by Sam. He should explain to Sam that such actions are unethical, illegal, and could have severe consequences for both of them, including legal repercussions and damage to their professional reputations. Tim should request a meeting with his boss to disclose Sam's unethical behavior and seek guidance on how to proceed with the deal in an honest and transparent manner. Additionally, Tim should document the attempted bribe and altered agreement to protect himself and ensure a fair resolution to the situation.
