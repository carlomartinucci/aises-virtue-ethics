I would conduct a thorough analysis of the situation, considering the implications of Google's actions on both Microsoft and the users affected by the vulnerabilities. I would then engage in open communication with both Google and Microsoft to understand their perspectives and concerns regarding the disclosure timeline. Additionally, I would review the existing industry standards and best practices related to responsible vulnerability disclosure to guide my decision-making process. Based on this analysis, I would work towards facilitating a constructive dialogue between the two companies to address their differences and find a mutually agreeable solution for future disclosures. Finally, I would document the lessons learned from this incident to help prevent similar conflicts in the future and improve the overall vulnerability disclosure process.
