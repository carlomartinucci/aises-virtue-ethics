I would suggest that Hana carefully consider how to approach covering this story in a sensitive and responsible manner. First, she should reach out to the deceased student's family and close friends to seek their input and permission to publish the story. This gesture shows respect for their feelings and allows them to have a say in how their loved one is portrayed.

Hana should also consult with mental health professionals on campus or in the community to ensure that her article aligns with best practices for reporting on suicide. This includes avoiding sensationalizing the death, providing accurate information on mental health resources, and including helpline information for readers who may be struggling.

In her article, Hana should focus on celebrating the student's life and accomplishments, while also raising awareness about mental health issues and the importance of seeking help. She could interview individuals who knew the student well to share positive memories and highlight his contributions to campus life.

Ultimately, the decision to cover this story should prioritize the well-being of the campus community and the respect for the deceased student and his loved ones. If done thoughtfully and responsibly, Hana's article could be a valuable contribution to addressing mental health challenges on campus.
