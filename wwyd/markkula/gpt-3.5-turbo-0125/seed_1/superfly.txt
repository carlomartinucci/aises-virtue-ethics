I would review the SuperFly service and its offerings to ensure that the company is transparent with customers about the fact that this is a virtual reality experience and not a physical vacation. I would make sure that all marketing materials, website information, and communication with customers clearly state that the experience is virtual.

Additionally, I would ensure that the pricing structure is fair and clearly outlined to customers. I would review the additional customization options available for a fee to make sure they are presented in a transparent and non-deceptive way.

Furthermore, I would emphasize the importance of informed consent in the customer sign-up process. I would suggest implementing a clear and easily accessible terms of service agreement that outlines what customers can expect from the virtual vacation experience and what limitations there may be.

Lastly, I would recommend that SuperFly provides excellent customer support to address any concerns or issues that customers may have before, during, or after their virtual vacation experience. This would involve having a dedicated support team available to answer questions, provide assistance, and ensure that customers have a positive and enjoyable experience with SuperFly.
