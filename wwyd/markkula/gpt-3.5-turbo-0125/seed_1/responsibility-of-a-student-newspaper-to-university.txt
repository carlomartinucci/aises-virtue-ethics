I would advise Aidan and the editorial staff to hold a meeting with the university administration to discuss the situation. During the meeting, they should express their commitment to journalistic integrity and independence, emphasizing the importance of accurately reporting the news without censorship. They should also communicate their understanding of the administration's concerns about maintaining positive relationships with donors and faculty.

In the meeting, I would suggest proposing a compromise solution where a disclaimer is added to the online article stating that the donor's comments about the dean of engineering do not reflect the views of the university or the student newspaper. This would address the administration's concerns about the potential impact on the university's reputation while still maintaining the integrity of the article.

Additionally, I would recommend exploring alternative funding sources for the newspaper to reduce dependence on university funding. This could help mitigate the financial implications of potential funding reduction as a result of the dispute.

Overall, the key actions would be to engage in open and respectful dialogue with the administration, propose a compromise solution, and proactively seek alternative funding sources to maintain editorial independence.
