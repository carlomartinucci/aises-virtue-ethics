As Akira, I would politely but firmly explain to the upset senator that the final agenda item involves a sensitive disciplinary issue regarding a member of the student government, and for the privacy and integrity of the process, it is necessary for the discussion to be held in confidence. While I appreciate his desire for transparency, I would emphasize the importance of handling such matters with discretion to protect the privacy and dignity of all involved. I would kindly request the senator to respect this need for confidentiality and leave the meeting room to allow the executive board to address the issue appropriately.
