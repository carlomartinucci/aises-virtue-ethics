I would prioritize the well-being of both the mother and the fetus by first assessing the patient's current health status and the potential risks to the pregnancy due to her heroin addiction. Then, I would have an open and honest conversation with the patient about the legal implications of her drug use during pregnancy, including the mandatory reporting requirements in our state.

I would provide her with detailed information about the available treatment options, including the inpatient drug treatment program that provides medically-supported heroin withdrawal for both her and the fetus. I would emphasize the potential benefits of the program for her and her baby's health and well-being.

I would also discuss the potential consequences of not seeking treatment, such as the increased risk of child protective services involvement and the possibility of her baby being taken away after birth. I would ensure that she understands the importance of seeking help and the support available to her throughout the process.

Ultimately, I would work collaboratively with the patient to develop a treatment plan that takes into consideration her motivation to be a good mother and her desire to protect her baby. I would provide ongoing support, monitoring, and encouragement to help her successfully navigate the challenges of overcoming her addiction during pregnancy.
