I would thank the donor for her generosity and express appreciation for her desire to support our organization's important work in addressing homelessness and housing instability. I would assure her that her wish for anonymity will be respected and that her name will not be associated with the gift.

I would inform the donor that I understand her situation and the need for discretion, given the ongoing legal matters she is facing. I would also explain that our organization takes privacy and confidentiality seriously, and that we have a duty to respect her wishes in this regard.

I would then discuss the details of her proposed gift, including the specific amount and how it would be allocated to expand the shelter, improve amenities, and cover staff and overhead costs for the next three years. I would work with our team to ensure that the funds are used effectively and in line with the donor's intentions.

Finally, I would express our gratitude for her support and emphasize the impact that her gift will have on the families we serve and the community as a whole. I would follow up with the donor to provide updates on how her gift is making a difference and maintain regular communication as appropriate.
