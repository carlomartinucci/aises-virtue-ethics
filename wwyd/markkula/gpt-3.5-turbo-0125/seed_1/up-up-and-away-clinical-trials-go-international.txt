I would immediately review the ethical guidelines and regulations regarding informed consent in clinical trials set by international bodies such as the World Medical Association, the International Conference on Harmonisation, and the Declaration of Helsinki. I would also consult with legal experts to understand the specific legal obligations that Rx may have violated during the clinical trial in Russia. Subsequently, I would initiate an internal investigation within Rx to assess the actions taken during the trial, particularly regarding the informed consent process, patient education, and post-trial care. Based on the findings of the investigation, I would take appropriate actions, which may include providing post-trial care to the participants, issuing public apologies, and implementing corrective measures to prevent similar ethical breaches in future trials. Additionally, I would engage with relevant stakeholders, such as patient advocacy groups, regulatory authorities, and medical professionals, to address the ethical concerns raised by the trial in Russia and work towards ensuring that all future clinical trials conducted by Rx adhere to the highest ethical standards.
