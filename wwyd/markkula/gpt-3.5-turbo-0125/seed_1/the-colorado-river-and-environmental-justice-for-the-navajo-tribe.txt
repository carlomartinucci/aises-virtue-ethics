I would work to ensure that the Navajo tribe is included in the ongoing negotiations and discussions regarding water rights and allocations from the Colorado River. This would involve advocating for the Navajo Nation's representation at the negotiating table to ensure their concerns, needs, and historical rights are taken into account. Additionally, I would support efforts to address the systemic injustices faced by the Navajo tribe in accessing clean water by working with relevant stakeholders to develop sustainable solutions that prioritize the tribe's water rights and access to safe and reliable water sources.
