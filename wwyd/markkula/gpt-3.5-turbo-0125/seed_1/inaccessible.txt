I would immediately address the situation by acknowledging the oversight in the physical examination of Michelle. I would apologize to Michelle for the missed sacral ulcer and the subsequent impact on her health. I would ensure that Michelle receives prompt and appropriate medical treatment for her stage three decubitus ulcer, including wound care, IV antibiotics, and consultation with surgery as required. Additionally, I would provide support to Michelle by arranging for any necessary accommodations during her hospital stay, such as ensuring her mobility needs are met and coordinating with the appropriate healthcare professionals to address her specific requirements. Finally, I would prioritize Michelle's well-being and recovery by closely monitoring her progress and advocating for her needs throughout her hospitalization.
