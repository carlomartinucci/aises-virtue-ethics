If I were in this situation, I would first thoroughly review the terms of service and guidelines of the VR Rage Room app to ensure I understand the specific prohibitions regarding violence directed at humans. 

Next, I would regularly monitor the uploaded content on the platform to ensure that all user-generated rooms, objects, tools, and scenarios comply with the terms of service. If I come across any content that violates the rules, particularly those involving violence towards humans, I would take immediate action to remove the content from the platform and notify the user of the violation. This action would help maintain the integrity of the app and uphold the safety and well-being of its users.

Furthermore, if I notice a pattern of repeated violations by a specific user or creator, I would escalate the issue to the appropriate department within GoldCat for further investigation and potential enforcement actions, such as suspending or banning the user from the platform.

By proactively monitoring and enforcing the terms of service related to violent content, I would contribute to creating a safe and enjoyable virtual environment for users to engage in therapeutic rage room experiences.
