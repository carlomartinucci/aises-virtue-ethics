I would schedule a dedicated appointment with the patient to discuss his concerns about contracting syphilis. During the appointment, I would calmly and empathetically explore the reasons behind his belief, such as any recent experiences or external influences. I would provide psychoeducation about the symptoms of syphilis and the importance of relying on medical tests to confirm or rule out the presence of the infection. Additionally, I would collaborate with a medical doctor to perform a thorough examination and educate the patient about the negative test results. I would also address any underlying fears or anxieties that may be contributing to his current beliefs and work towards building a trusting therapeutic relationship to ensure his ongoing cooperation with the prescribed psychiatric treatment.
