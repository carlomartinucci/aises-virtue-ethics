I would advise Ana to prioritize Alexandra's well-being and safety above all else. Ana should respect Alexandra's request for anonymity in the article to protect her from potential social repercussions. Ana should ensure that Alexandra's identity is redacted thoroughly to maintain her confidentiality.

To address her concerns about perpetuating taboos surrounding sexual assault, Ana can provide general information about the challenges survivors face without revealing specific details that could identify Alexandra. Ana can also include statistics or expert opinions to emphasize the prevalence and impact of sexual assault without compromising Alexandra's confidentiality.

Additionally, Ana can offer resources for survivors of sexual assault at the end of the article to provide support and guidance for those who may be hesitant to come forward. By taking these steps, Ana can strike a balance between respecting Alexandra's privacy and raising awareness about the issues faced by survivors of sexual assault.
