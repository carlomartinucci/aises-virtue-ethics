I would collaborate with the sexual assault prevention center to organize a workshop specifically tailored for neurodiverse students. The workshop would focus on clear and explicit communication about consent, including verbal cues and boundaries. I would ensure that the materials and resources provided are accessible and understandable for neurodiverse individuals by incorporating visual aids, role-playing scenarios, and concrete examples. Additionally, I would seek feedback from neurodiverse students to ensure that the information presented is effective and relevant to their needs.
