I would work to advocate for the affected Michigan residents by collaborating with legal aid organizations to provide pro bono legal assistance to help them navigate the complex legal processes involved in seeking justice and compensation. This could include helping them gather evidence, file claims, and represent their interests in court proceedings. Additionally, I would engage with policymakers and advocacy groups to push for reforms that increase transparency and accountability in the use of automated systems like MiDAS to prevent similar injustices from occurring in the future.
