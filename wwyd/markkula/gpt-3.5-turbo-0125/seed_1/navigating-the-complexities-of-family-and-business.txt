I would recommend that Mary try to have a candid and open conversation with her brother Donald to discuss their differing viewpoints on the future of the family business. Mary should emphasize the importance of considering all perspectives and potential consequences before making any hasty decisions. 

During this conversation, Mary could propose a compromise solution that takes into account both financial considerations and family dynamics. For example, she could suggest exploring alternative options to manage the building efficiently without selling it, such as hiring external professionals to oversee the operations and explore opportunities to attract new tenants. 

Mary should also highlight the potential tax implications of selling the building and how it might affect each shareholder individually. By presenting a clear picture of the financial impact of selling the business, Mary may be able to persuade Donald to reconsider his position on liquidating the corporation. 

Furthermore, Mary should stress the importance of maintaining family harmony and working together to find a solution that is mutually beneficial for all shareholders. She should remind Donald of the legacy of the family business and the sentimental value it holds for the family members. 

Overall, Mary should approach the situation with empathy, understanding, and a willingness to find a compromise that respects both the financial interests and the family relationships at stake. She should prioritize open communication, collaboration, and mutual respect in navigating the decision-making process regarding the future of the family business.
