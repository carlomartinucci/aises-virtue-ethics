I would schedule a meeting with each of my three student staff members individually to discuss their workload and stress levels. I would ask them to share their current tasks, any challenges they are facing, and how they are managing their responsibilities. Based on their feedback, I would reassess their workload and responsibilities to ensure that they are not overwhelmed and that their tasks align with their job descriptions and capabilities.

After understanding their workload and challenges, I would prioritize the state-level advocacy work that has been neglected and take on a more active role in those responsibilities. I would communicate with my staff about the importance of balancing their workload and provide support in reallocating tasks to ensure that both the community relations work and state-level advocacy are being effectively managed. This could involve redistributing tasks among the team, seeking additional support from other ASI members, or reprioritizing certain responsibilities.

By actively addressing the workload concerns of my staff and taking on a more active role in the neglected state-level advocacy work, I aim to find a balance that allows for effective execution of all aspects of my position while supporting the well-being of my team.
