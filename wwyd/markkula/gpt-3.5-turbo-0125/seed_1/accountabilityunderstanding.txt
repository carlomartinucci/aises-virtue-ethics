I would schedule a one-on-one meeting with Jamie to discuss his recent performance and absences. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about his inconsistent attendance and communication, and how it is impacting the work of the executive council. I would also acknowledge that I understand he has been dealing with a challenging quarter.

I would ask Jamie to share more about the difficulties he has been facing and how we can support him better in managing his commitments. I would express my willingness to be flexible and explore potential solutions together, such as redistributing some of his responsibilities, adjusting deadlines, or providing additional resources.

I would set clear expectations moving forward, emphasizing the importance of regular attendance and effective communication within the team. I would also explain the consequences of continued absences and lack of improvement, while also reiterating my support for his success within the student government.

Ultimately, I would aim to strike a balance between holding Jamie accountable for his commitments and performance while also demonstrating understanding and empathy towards his challenges.
