During the meeting, Tre should present the evidence he has found and express his worries about the potential misrepresentation of sales data to the board of directors and investors. Tre should approach the conversation with a focus on seeking clarification and understanding, rather than accusing or blaming anyone for the issue. He should also inquire about the company's policies and procedures for reporting sales metrics and ask for guidance on how to address the problem effectively.

Additionally, Tre should document the details of the meeting, including the evidence he presented and the responses he received from his supervisor or manager. Keeping a record of the conversation can help protect Tre in case any issues arise in the future.

Overall, by proactively raising his concerns with his supervisor and seeking clarification on the company's reporting practices, Tre can demonstrate his commitment to ethical behavior and integrity while also taking steps to address the issue responsibly.
