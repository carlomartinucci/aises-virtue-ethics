I would ensure that the tool's opt-out feature is prominently displayed and easily accessible for website administrators who do not want their websites to be scanned by PunkSpider. Additionally, I would collaborate with cybersecurity experts to develop guidelines and best practices for responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities identified by PunkSpider to minimize the risk of exploitation by malicious actors. Finally, I would monitor the tool's usage and impact closely to assess whether it is effectively encouraging website administrators to address vulnerabilities without significantly increasing the risk of exploitation.
