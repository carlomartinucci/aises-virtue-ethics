I would advise Ben to prioritize honesty and integrity in this situation. Despite the potential risks to his job and his friendship with Michael, it is important for Ben to disclose all the information he knows about Michael's fraudulent activities to the company's internal investigation team. By providing this information, Ben can help the company understand the extent of the issue and take appropriate actions to address the fraud. This is crucial for maintaining the company's credibility and ensuring that unethical behavior is not tolerated. Additionally, by coming forward with the information he has, Ben can demonstrate his own commitment to ethical conduct and integrity, which will reflect positively on his reputation within the company. It is essential to remember that staying silent about fraudulent activities can have serious consequences in the long run, and it is always better to address such issues transparently and responsibly.
