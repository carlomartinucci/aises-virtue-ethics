I would thank the donor for their interest in supporting the university and inquire about their specific motivations for wanting to donate. I would express appreciation for their desire to give back to the community. I would then politely acknowledge the donor's association with the financial group and the controversy surrounding it, emphasizing the university's commitment to ethical practices and diversity in STEM education. I would ask if the donor is open to a meeting or discussion to learn more about their philanthropic goals and to provide more information about the university's initiatives in supporting underrepresented students in STEM fields. Finally, I would consult with university leadership or the fundraising team on how to proceed with the potential donation while ensuring alignment with the university's values and mission.
