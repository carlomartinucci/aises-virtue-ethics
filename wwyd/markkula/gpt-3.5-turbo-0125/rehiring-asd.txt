I would review the company's policies and procedures regarding rehiring terminated employees, as well as any specific guidelines related to accommodating employees with disabilities such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). I would then schedule a meeting with relevant stakeholders, including HR, legal, and management, to discuss Matt's request for reinstatement in light of his ASD disclosure. During the meeting, I would gather information on the circumstances surrounding Matt's termination, the impact of his ASD on his behavior, and any potential accommodations that could be made to support his successful return to work. Based on this information, I would work with the team to make an informed decision on whether to reinstate Matt and, if so, what steps need to be taken to ensure a smooth transition back to his previous position.
