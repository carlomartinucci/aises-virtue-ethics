I would thank the donor for her generous offer and express gratitude for her desire to support the shelter and the families in need. I would assure her that her wish for anonymity will be respected and that her name will not be associated with the gift in any way. I would explain that the shelter is in great need of funding to expand its capacity and improve services for families experiencing homelessness, and that her contribution would have a significant impact on the organization's ability to serve more families in need. I would then work with our finance and legal teams to ensure that the donation is processed securely and in compliance with all relevant regulations.
