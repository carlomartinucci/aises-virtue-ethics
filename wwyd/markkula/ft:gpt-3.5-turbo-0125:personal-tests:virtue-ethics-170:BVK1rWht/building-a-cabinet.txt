I would first have individual meetings with each of the opposing candidates who expressed willingness to take other positions. During these meetings, I would discuss their motivations for wanting to be part of the executive cabinet, their vision for the organization, and how they plan to contribute positively despite the election outcome. I would also address any concerns about potential resentment and seek assurances that they are committed to working collaboratively for the betterment of the student government.

After these meetings, I would carefully evaluate the responses and select one of the opposing candidates based on their demonstrated commitment to unity, their proposed contributions, and their ability to work effectively within a team dynamic. I would then inform them of their appointment to the executive cabinet and discuss expectations moving forward.

By taking this approach, I aim to make an informed decision based on the candidates' individual merits and potential contributions, while also prioritizing the goal of fostering unity within the organization.
