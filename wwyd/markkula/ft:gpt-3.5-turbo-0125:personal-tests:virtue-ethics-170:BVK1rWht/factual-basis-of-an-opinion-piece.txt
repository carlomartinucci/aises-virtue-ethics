I would first verify the information provided by the Admissions Office to confirm that the university indeed does not practice affirmative action in its admissions process. Then, I would have a meeting with Jack to discuss the discrepancy between his claims in the article and the university's actual policies. I would explain to Jack the importance of accuracy in journalism and the need to ensure that his opinions are based on factual information.

During the meeting, I would offer Jack the opportunity to revise his article to reflect the correct information about the university's admissions process. If Jack refuses to make the necessary corrections, I would inform him that the article cannot be published in its current form due to the factual inaccuracies.

I would also consider offering Jack the option to write a follow-up piece discussing the importance of fact-checking and accuracy in opinion writing, using this situation as a case study. This would allow Jack to still express his views on the topic while also addressing the need for responsible journalism.
