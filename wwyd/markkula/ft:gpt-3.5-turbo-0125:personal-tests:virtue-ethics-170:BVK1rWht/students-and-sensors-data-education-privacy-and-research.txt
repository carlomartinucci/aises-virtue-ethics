I would first review the university's policies and procedures regarding the collection and use of student data to understand the existing framework in place. Next, I would reach out to the researcher and the assistant provost for institutional research to gather more information about the specific data points being collected, how they are being analyzed, and what measures are in place to ensure student privacy and confidentiality. I would also inquire about the process for obtaining student consent and how students are informed about the data collection practices.

Additionally, I would organize a meeting with relevant stakeholders, including students, faculty, academic advisers, and university administrators, to discuss the ethical implications of using student data for predictive analytics. During this meeting, I would facilitate a dialogue to address concerns about privacy, transparency, and consent. I would also explore the possibility of implementing an opt-out mechanism for students who are uncomfortable with their data being used in this manner.

Finally, I would collaborate with the university's IT department to conduct a thorough review of the data security measures in place to protect student information from unauthorized access or misuse. I would ensure that all data handling practices comply with relevant laws and regulations, such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and that students are informed about their rights regarding their personal data.
