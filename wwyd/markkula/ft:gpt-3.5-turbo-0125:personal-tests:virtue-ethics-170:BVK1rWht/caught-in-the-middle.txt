I would schedule a meeting with the Executive Cabinet and the Senate Committee Chairs separately to facilitate a calm and constructive dialogue. During these meetings, I would encourage each side to express their concerns and perspectives openly and respectfully. I would actively listen to their viewpoints and try to find common ground between the two parties. I would also work to mediate a compromise that addresses the concerns raised by both sides regarding the attendance policy. Additionally, I would emphasize the importance of collaboration and unity within the student government organization to achieve its goals effectively.
