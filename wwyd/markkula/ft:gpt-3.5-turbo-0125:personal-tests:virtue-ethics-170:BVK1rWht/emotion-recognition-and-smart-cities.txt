I would first review the privacy policies and terms of service of the technology company to ensure that they have robust data protection measures in place. I would then consult with legal experts to determine if sharing the video recordings with the company complies with local privacy laws and regulations. If it is legally permissible, I would negotiate a detailed data-sharing agreement with the company that clearly outlines the limitations on the use of the data, the security measures that must be implemented, and the duration for which the data will be retained. Additionally, I would establish regular audits to monitor the company's compliance with the agreement and ensure that the privacy of the city's residents is protected.
