I would immediately bring this information to the attention of the museum's executive director and the board of directors. I would recommend that we conduct a thorough due diligence process to gather more information about the accusations against the donor's family and assess the potential risks and implications of accepting the donation. I would also suggest reaching out to legal counsel to understand any legal ramifications of accepting the donation in light of the ongoing investigation. Additionally, I would propose drafting a statement to be transparent with the donor about our awareness of the situation and our need for more information before making a decision.
