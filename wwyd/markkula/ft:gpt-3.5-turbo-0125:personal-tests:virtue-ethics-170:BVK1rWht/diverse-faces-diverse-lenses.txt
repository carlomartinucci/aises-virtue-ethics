I would immediately review the process and criteria used by IBM Research to select and annotate the photographs from the YFCC-100M Creative Commons data set for the Diversity in Faces (DiF) dataset. I would assess whether the selection process was transparent and whether the individuals whose photographs were included were informed and gave consent for their images to be used in this manner. Additionally, I would investigate the measures in place for individuals to request the removal of their photos from the dataset and ensure that these processes are clear and accessible. If necessary, I would work with the team responsible for the dataset to improve transparency, consent procedures, and removal mechanisms to address the concerns raised by the media reports.
