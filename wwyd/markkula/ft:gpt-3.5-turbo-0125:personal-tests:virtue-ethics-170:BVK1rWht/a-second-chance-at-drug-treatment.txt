I would schedule a meeting with Jerome to discuss his situation in detail. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about his recent relapse and the importance of consistent attendance in the program for successful recovery. I would also inquire about his current living situation, support system, and willingness to commit to the program's requirements moving forward.

Given Jerome's history and the severity of his relapse, I would strongly recommend that he consider inpatient addiction treatment for a better chance at long-term recovery. I would provide him with information about available inpatient facilities, including the one with the longer waiting list, and offer to assist him in navigating the admission process.

I would also address the issue of racial discrimination and the potential barriers Jerome may have faced in accessing timely medical care. I would assure him that I am committed to providing him with the support he needs to overcome these challenges and achieve his recovery goals.

Ultimately, I would make it clear to Jerome that while I empathize with his struggles and am willing to support him in seeking inpatient treatment, consistent attendance and active participation in the outpatient program are essential for his overall recovery journey.
