I would convene a meeting with representatives from both student organizations and faculty members to discuss the issue. During the meeting, I would explain the concerns about email volume and student dissatisfaction with the current system. I would propose a compromise where faculty members could submit their information to be included in the weekly newsletter alongside student organization events, rather than sending individual emails to the list. This way, students would still have access to valuable information from faculty members without overwhelming the email list with additional messages. I would also offer to work with faculty members to ensure their information is effectively communicated in the newsletter to maximize student engagement.
