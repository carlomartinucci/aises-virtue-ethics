I would thank the donor for their interest in supporting the university and its mission to diversify STEM education. I would express gratitude for their willingness to contribute to the university's campaign. I would then inform the donor that the university takes ethical considerations seriously and that we have a due diligence process in place for all donations to ensure alignment with our values. I would kindly ask the donor for more information about their background and their specific reasons for wanting to support the university. I would also inform them that their association with the financial group raises some concerns due to the group's past practices, and that we would need to conduct a thorough review before accepting any donations. I would assure the donor that we will get back to them promptly after the review process is completed.
