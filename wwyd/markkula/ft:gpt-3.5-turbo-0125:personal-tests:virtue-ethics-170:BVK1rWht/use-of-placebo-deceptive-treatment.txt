I would schedule a dedicated appointment with the patient to discuss his concerns about contracting syphilis. During the appointment, I would calmly and empathetically explore his beliefs and fears about the disease, as well as his recent sexual history. I would review his medical records together with him to show the negative test results for syphilis and other STDs. I would then explain the importance of addressing his symptoms of schizophrenia and the need for him to continue taking the prescribed psychiatric medications. I would also offer to involve a specialist in infectious diseases to further evaluate his concerns about syphilis and provide additional reassurance.
