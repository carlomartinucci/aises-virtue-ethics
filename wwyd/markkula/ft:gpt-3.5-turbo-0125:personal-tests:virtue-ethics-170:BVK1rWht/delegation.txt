I would schedule a meeting with my three student staff members to discuss their current workload and stress levels. During the meeting, I would ask each staff member to provide an overview of their current responsibilities, projects, and deadlines. I would also inquire about any challenges they are facing and if they feel overwhelmed with their workload.

Based on the information gathered during the meeting, I would reassess the distribution of responsibilities among the team. I would work with each staff member to prioritize tasks and possibly redistribute some duties to ensure a more balanced workload. I would also provide additional support or resources if needed, such as training, mentorship, or assistance from other team members.

Additionally, I would review my own position description and identify the key responsibilities that I must personally handle, such as advocating for student financial aid and government funding at the state level. I would then create a plan to gradually take back these responsibilities from my staff members while still supporting them in their roles.

Overall, my goal would be to ensure that my team members are not overwhelmed, that all essential tasks are being addressed, and that I am fulfilling my duties as the External Relations Vice President effectively.
