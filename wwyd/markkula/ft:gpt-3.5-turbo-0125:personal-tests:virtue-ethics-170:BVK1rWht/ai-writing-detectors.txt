I would conduct a thorough review of the available AI-detection tools, including Turnitin's, to understand their limitations and potential biases. I would analyze the data provided by each tool's developers to assess their accuracy rates, false positive rates, and any specific issues related to non-native English speakers. Based on this analysis, I would recommend to educational institutions the most reliable and fair AI-detection tool to use, taking into consideration the potential impact on students' academic integrity and the risk of false accusations. Additionally, I would suggest implementing a system where flagged cases are reviewed by human instructors to ensure fair treatment of students.
