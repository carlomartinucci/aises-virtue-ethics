I would advise Talia to hold a town hall meeting with her sophomore constituents to openly discuss the smoking ban issue. During the meeting, she should present the concerns raised by the university administration regarding potential legal issues and student rights violations. Talia should facilitate a respectful and informative dialogue where students can express their opinions and ask questions about the ban.

After the town hall meeting, I would recommend that Talia conduct a formal survey or poll to gauge the sentiment of her constituents more accurately. This survey should include questions about their support for the smoking ban, their awareness of the potential legal concerns, and their willingness to compromise on the issue.

Based on the feedback from the town hall meeting and the survey results, Talia should make an informed decision on whether to vote for or against the smoking ban. She should prioritize representing the interests of her constituents while also considering the legal implications and potential consequences of her decision. Talia should communicate her decision transparently, explaining the rationale behind it to her constituents to maintain their trust and support.
