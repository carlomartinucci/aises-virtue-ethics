I would advise Hana to cover the story of the student's death in a sensitive and responsible manner. She should focus on celebrating the student's life and contributions to the campus community, highlighting his involvement in student government, environmental justice advocacy, and interfaith programming. Hana should also address the importance of mental health care and resources on campus, without going into graphic details of the suicide. She should include information about helplines and support services for those struggling with mental health issues. Hana should approach the article with empathy and respect for the student's memory and his family, while also aiming to raise awareness and start a constructive dialogue about mental health on campus.
