I would advise Nadia to disclose her involvement in the student organization dedicated to social activism and service learning in the article about the protest. By being transparent about her connections to the organization, Nadia can maintain her credibility as a fair and objective reporter. This disclosure will help readers understand her perspective and potential biases, allowing them to interpret the information presented in the article more critically. Additionally, I would suggest that Nadia actively seek out and include diverse perspectives in her reporting to ensure a balanced and comprehensive coverage of the protest and the issues surrounding the working conditions of the schoolâ€™s custodial staff.
