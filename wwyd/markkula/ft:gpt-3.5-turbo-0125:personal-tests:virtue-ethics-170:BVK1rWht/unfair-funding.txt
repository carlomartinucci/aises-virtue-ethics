I would schedule a meeting with Garret to discuss the situation openly and transparently. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about the potential bias in funding approvals towards his club, despite his efforts to remain neutral. I would emphasize the importance of fairness and equal opportunities for all clubs and organizations on campus. I would suggest implementing a system where Garret recuses himself completely from the decision-making process regarding his club's funding requests, to avoid any perception of favoritism. I would also propose rotating the responsibility of overseeing his club's funding requests among other committee members to ensure a more impartial evaluation process. Additionally, I would recommend conducting a review of the funding allocation process to identify any systemic issues that may be contributing to the unequal distribution of funds among clubs.
