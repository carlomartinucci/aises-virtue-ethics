I would schedule a meeting with Fred to discuss the concerns about the audit hours not aligning with the proposal and the pressure to be more efficient without clear guidance. During the meeting, I would present the evidence showing that the current budgeted hours are insufficient to complete the audit work effectively. I would also express my discomfort with the implicit message to underreport hours on the time sheets and seek clarification on the expectations regarding time tracking.

Additionally, I would raise the issue of the required firm training and the proposal of doing it over the weekend at a team member's house. I would seek guidance on how to appropriately account for this time on the time sheets and ensure that all team members are clear on the expectations regarding training completion and time tracking.

Overall, I would aim to have an open and honest conversation with Fred to address the concerns and seek clarity on how to proceed in a manner that upholds professional standards and integrity while meeting the firm's expectations.
