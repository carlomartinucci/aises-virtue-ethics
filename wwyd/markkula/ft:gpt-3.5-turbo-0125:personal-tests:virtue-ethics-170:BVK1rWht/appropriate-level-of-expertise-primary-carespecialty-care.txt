I would explain to Peter that while I appreciate his trust in me, diagnosing and treating bi-polar disorder is beyond my expertise as a primary care physician. I would emphasize the importance of getting a proper evaluation from a psychiatrist who specializes in mental health conditions like bi-polar disorder. I would offer to help him find a psychiatrist he feels comfortable with and provide support throughout the process. If Peter continues to refuse to see a psychiatrist, I would document our conversation thoroughly in his medical records, including my concerns about the possibility of bi-polar disorder and his refusal for further evaluation. I would continue to monitor his symptoms closely and encourage him to reconsider seeking help from a mental health professional.
