I would schedule a meeting with the staff at the sexual assault prevention center to discuss the issue of vague and potentially inaccessible information for neurodiverse individuals. During the meeting, I would bring up the specific concerns regarding the current descriptions of consent and suggest revising the materials to include clear, explicit examples of verbal communication and non-verbal cues that can be universally understood. I would offer to collaborate with the staff to create new resources that are more inclusive and accessible to all students, including those who are neurodiverse.
