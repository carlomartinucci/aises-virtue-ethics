I would first consult with the organization's HR department to understand the specific policies and guidelines in place regarding accommodations for employees with disabilities, including those related to emotional support animals. I would also seek clarification on what constitutes an undue hardship for the organization in this context.

Next, I would have a private conversation with Spencer to discuss his needs and how they align with the organization's policies and resources. I would express my support for his well-being and the importance of accommodating his emotional support animal, while also addressing the potential challenges and concerns raised by other staff and students.

I would then convene a meeting with relevant stakeholders, including Spencer, to openly discuss the situation and explore possible solutions. This could involve brainstorming ways to accommodate Spencer's needs while minimizing any negative impact on others, such as implementing a schedule for the dog's presence, providing alternative housing arrangements, or offering additional training for staff and students on interacting with the animal.

Throughout this process, I would prioritize open communication, empathy, and a collaborative approach to finding a resolution that respects Spencer's rights, supports his well-being, and maintains a positive and inclusive environment for all staff and students involved in the program.
