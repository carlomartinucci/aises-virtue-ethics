I would schedule a meeting with the editorial team of the school newspaper to discuss the ethical implications of tweeting campus safety reports. During the meeting, I would bring up the concerns about the potential harm of turning serious safety incidents into entertainment for the sake of increasing readership. I would suggest conducting a survey or focus group with students to gather their opinions on the matter and use that feedback to inform a decision on whether to continue tweeting these reports. Additionally, I would propose exploring alternative ways to engage students on social media that do not compromise the integrity of the newspaper's reporting.
