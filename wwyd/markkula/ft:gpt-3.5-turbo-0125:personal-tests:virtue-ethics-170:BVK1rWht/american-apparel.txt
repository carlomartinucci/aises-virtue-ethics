I would conduct a thorough review of American Apparel's current policies and procedures related to workplace conduct, sexual harassment, and ethical practices. This would involve examining the company's employee handbook, code of conduct, and any training materials related to these issues. I would also review any recent complaints or reports of misconduct within the company to assess the current culture and identify any areas of concern.

Additionally, I would schedule meetings with key stakeholders within the organization, including HR representatives, managers, and employees, to discuss their experiences and perspectives on the company's culture and values. This would provide valuable insights into the current state of affairs and help identify any gaps or areas for improvement.

Based on the findings from these reviews and discussions, I would develop a comprehensive action plan to address any issues related to workplace conduct, sexual harassment, and ethical practices. This plan would include specific steps such as revising policies, implementing additional training programs, and establishing clear reporting mechanisms for employees to raise concerns.

Finally, I would present this action plan to the board of directors and senior leadership team for approval and support. I would then work closely with HR and other relevant departments to ensure the successful implementation of these initiatives and monitor progress over time to ensure sustained improvement in the company's culture and practices.
