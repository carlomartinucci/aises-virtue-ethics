I would gather all the evidence I have regarding Michael's fraudulent scheme, including the sales transactions, accounting records, and any other relevant information. I would then schedule a meeting with the internal investigators conducting the company's investigation into the matter. During the meeting, I would present all the evidence I have gathered and provide a detailed account of what I know about Michael's actions. I would be transparent and cooperative throughout the meeting, answering any questions the investigators may have to the best of my ability.

I would emphasize that I had no knowledge of Michael's fraudulent activities while they were occurring and that I only became aware of the situation after taking over his sales territories. I would make it clear that I am committed to upholding the company's values and integrity and that I believe it is essential to address and rectify any unethical behavior that may have occurred.

I would also express my concerns about the potential consequences of speaking up, including the impact on my own position within the company and the strain it may place on my friendship with Michael. However, I would stress that the importance of honesty and accountability in the workplace outweighs these personal considerations.

Ultimately, I would cooperate fully with the investigation and provide all the information and assistance necessary to help the company understand the extent of the fraudulent scheme and take appropriate action to address it.
