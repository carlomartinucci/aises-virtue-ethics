I would express my gratitude to the President and Vice President for offering me the Director of Marketing position. I would then ask for some time to consider the offer and discuss it with my friend who wanted the position. I would also reach out to the friend to have an open and honest conversation about the situation, explaining my thoughts and feelings about the position and seeking their perspective. Additionally, I would reflect on my own goals and aspirations within the student government organization, considering how the Director of Marketing role aligns with my long-term objectives. Finally, I would make a decision based on a combination of these factors, taking into account the best interests of the organization, my personal growth opportunities, and the impact on my relationship with my friend.
