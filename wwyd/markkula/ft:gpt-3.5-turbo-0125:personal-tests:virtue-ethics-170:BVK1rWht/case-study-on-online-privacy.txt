I would conduct a thorough review of the social media monitoring tools being pitched to schools and universities. This review would involve examining the algorithms used by these tools to analyze social media posts, as well as assessing the accuracy and effectiveness of the sentiment analysis in identifying potential threats. I would also investigate the track record of these tools in terms of false positives and false negatives.

Additionally, I would gather feedback from experts in the field of social media analysis and child psychology to better understand the limitations and potential risks associated with using these tools in educational settings. This feedback would help in evaluating whether the tools are capable of accurately interpreting the context of students' online posts and whether they could potentially harm the relationship between students and school administrators.

Based on the findings of these reviews and consultations, I would provide a detailed report to school administrators outlining the potential benefits and risks of implementing such monitoring tools. I would recommend a transparent and inclusive approach to decision-making, involving students, parents, and school boards in the discussion before any final decisions are made.
