I would advise Olivia to consult with a mentor or trusted colleague within the university's Associated Students Inc. organization to discuss her concerns about the timing of her campaign preparations. This person could provide an objective perspective on the situation and offer guidance on how to navigate the ethical considerations of using her current role to boost her campaign. Additionally, I would suggest that Olivia consider seeking advice from a university ethics committee or relevant authority to ensure that her actions align with the organization's ethical standards. This proactive approach will help Olivia address her concerns and make informed decisions moving forward.
