I would immediately address the situation by apologizing to Michelle for the oversight and the resulting harm caused by not providing appropriate accommodations during her physical examination. I would ensure that Michelle receives the necessary medical treatment for her decubitus ulcer and coordinate with the healthcare team to provide comprehensive care for her condition. I would also schedule a meeting with the clinic staff to discuss the importance of accessibility for patients with disabilities, provide additional training on treating patients with mobility disabilities, and implement protocols to ensure that all patients receive proper accommodations during their appointments.
