I would work to raise awareness about the issue by reaching out to local media outlets to cover the story and bring attention to the plight of the Michigan residents who were wrongly accused of fraud due to the faulty MiDAS system. I would also collaborate with advocacy groups and legal organizations to provide support and resources to those affected, helping them navigate the complex legal process and seek justice for the harm they have suffered. Additionally, I would engage with policymakers and government officials to push for reforms in the use of automated systems to ensure that similar injustices do not occur in the future.
