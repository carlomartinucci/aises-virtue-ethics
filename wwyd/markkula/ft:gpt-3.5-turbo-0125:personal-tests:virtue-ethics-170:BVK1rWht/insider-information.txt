I would explain to Alex that as the Finance Commissioner, I must maintain impartiality and fairness in the funding process. I would offer to provide general advice or answer any specific questions Alex may have about the funding guidelines or process, but I would refrain from reviewing his specific proposal to avoid any perception of bias or unfair advantage. I would emphasize that my role is to ensure all student organizations have an equal opportunity to access funding and that I must adhere to the established procedures to uphold the integrity of the process.
