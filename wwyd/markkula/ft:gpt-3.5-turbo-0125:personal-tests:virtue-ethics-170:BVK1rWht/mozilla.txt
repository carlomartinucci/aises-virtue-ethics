I would acknowledge Brendan Eich's resignation as CEO and communicate with the board and employees to ensure a smooth transition in leadership. I would also work on addressing any concerns or tensions within the organization that arose from this situation, emphasizing the importance of aligning personal values with the values of the company to maintain a positive and inclusive work environment. Additionally, I would review and potentially update the organization's policies and guidelines to prevent similar controversies in the future.
