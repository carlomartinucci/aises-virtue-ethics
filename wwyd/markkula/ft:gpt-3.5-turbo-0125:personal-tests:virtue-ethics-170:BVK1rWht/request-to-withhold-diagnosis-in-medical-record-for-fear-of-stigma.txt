I would explain to Sophie the importance of honesty and transparency in medical records, especially when it comes to mental health issues. I would express my concern for her well-being and emphasize the potential risks of not disclosing her history of depression in her medical records, particularly in relation to her future medical licensure applications. I would strongly encourage her to consider the long-term implications of withholding this information and the potential impact it could have on her career as a physician. I would offer to support her in seeking appropriate treatment for her depression, including therapy and medication, while also exploring ways to address her concerns about the impact on her licensure applications. I would reassure her that seeking help for mental health issues is a sign of strength and resilience, and that there are ways to navigate the licensing process with honesty and integrity.
