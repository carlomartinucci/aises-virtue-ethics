I would schedule a one-on-one meeting with Jamie to discuss his recent behavior and absences. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about his lack of attendance and communication, and how it is affecting the work of the executive council. I would also acknowledge the challenges he has been facing with his classes and other responsibilities at the university.

I would ask Jamie to provide a plan on how he intends to improve his attendance and communication moving forward. I would also offer support and resources to help him manage his workload and commitments more effectively. Additionally, I would set clear expectations for his future participation and follow-up with regular check-ins to monitor his progress.

If Jamie continues to struggle with meeting the expectations set by the executive council, I would consider implementing a probationary period or reducing his responsibilities within the council until he is able to fully commit to his role. Ultimately, my goal would be to find a balance between holding Jamie accountable for his commitments while also providing understanding and support during this challenging time.
