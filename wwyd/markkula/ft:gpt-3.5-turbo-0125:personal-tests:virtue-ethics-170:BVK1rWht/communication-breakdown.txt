I would advise Derek to schedule a meeting with the Vice Provost to discuss the concerns and frustrations he is facing. During the meeting, Derek should express his desire to authentically represent the students' needs and frustrations, even if they do not align perfectly with the administration's goals. Derek should explain the importance of addressing the off-campus Greek life thefts and the impact it has on a significant portion of the student body. He should propose a compromise where he can still maintain a positive relationship with the Vice Provost while also advocating for the students' genuine concerns. Derek should emphasize the value of transparency and open communication in order to find a solution that benefits both the students and the administration.
