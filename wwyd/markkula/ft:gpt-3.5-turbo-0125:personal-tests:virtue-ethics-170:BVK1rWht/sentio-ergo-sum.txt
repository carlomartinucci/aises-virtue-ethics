I would conduct a thorough review of the software's data collection and analysis practices to ensure that they are in compliance with relevant privacy laws and regulations. This would involve examining the terms of service and privacy policy provided to customers to determine if they adequately disclose the extent of voice analysis being conducted. If necessary, I would work with legal counsel to update these documents to provide more transparency to callers about the software's capabilities. Additionally, I would recommend implementing a process for obtaining explicit consent from callers before their voice data is analyzed in this manner.
