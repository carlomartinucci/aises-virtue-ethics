I would arrange a meeting with Kyle's parents, the doctor, and representatives from Eminent Scholars to discuss the concerns and benefits of enrolling Kyle in the school. During the meeting, I would ensure that all parties have a chance to express their thoughts and ask questions. I would provide information about the school's approach to social skills development, including any specific programs or strategies they have in place to support students like Kyle in improving communication and teamwork. I would also inquire about the availability of resources such as speech therapists or social skills groups that could supplement Kyle's education at Eminent Scholars. Additionally, I would suggest a trial period for Kyle to attend the school part-time to assess how well he adapts to the new environment and to address any initial concerns about potential isolation.
