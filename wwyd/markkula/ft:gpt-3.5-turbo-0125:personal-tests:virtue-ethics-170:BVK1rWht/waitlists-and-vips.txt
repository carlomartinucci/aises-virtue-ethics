I would immediately rectify the errors in data entry and create a waiting list by sending out an email to the senior class. I would clearly explain the situation, apologize for the oversight, and inform them that there are five additional tickets available. I would set a deadline for responses and then randomly select five seniors from the waiting list to attend the event. This way, I would ensure fairness in the distribution of the remaining tickets and give other seniors who desperately want to attend a chance to participate in the Senior Ball.
