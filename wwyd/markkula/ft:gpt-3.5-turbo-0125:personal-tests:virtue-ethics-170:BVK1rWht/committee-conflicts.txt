I would schedule a meeting with the other members of the University Affairs Student Senate Committee to discuss my concerns about the time commitment and the need to balance committee work with connecting more directly with the student body. I would propose delegating some tasks within the committee to free up time for me to engage with students, particularly those who have returned from studying abroad. I would emphasize the importance of understanding and addressing the changing needs of our constituents to ensure that our committee work is truly representative and impactful.
