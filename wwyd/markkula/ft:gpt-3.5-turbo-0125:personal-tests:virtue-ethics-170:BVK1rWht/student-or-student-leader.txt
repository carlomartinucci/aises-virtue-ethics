I would first meet with the two senators individually to discuss the situation and explore potential solutions. I would ask them if there are any alternative ways they can fulfill their responsibilities as senators despite missing the meetings. This could include providing written reports, participating in discussions via email or video conferencing, or delegating specific tasks to other members.

If these options are not feasible, I would propose to the Senate that an exception be made to the attendance policy for these two senators due to their unique circumstances. I would emphasize the importance of accommodating students who are facing academic challenges that are beyond their control, and stress the value of having diverse perspectives represented in the student government.

I would also work with the senators to ensure that they stay informed about the discussions and decisions made during the meetings, so that they can continue to effectively represent their constituents despite their absence. Additionally, I would encourage them to communicate with their constituents regularly to gather feedback and address any concerns that arise.

Overall, my goal would be to find a solution that allows the two senators to fulfill their duties to the best of their abilities, while also upholding the integrity of the student government and ensuring that all voices are heard.
