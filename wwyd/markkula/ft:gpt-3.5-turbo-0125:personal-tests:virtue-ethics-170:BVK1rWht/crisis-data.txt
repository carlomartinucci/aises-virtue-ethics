I would conduct a thorough review of the data-sharing agreement between Crisis Text Line and Loris.ai to understand the specifics of how the data was being used and shared. I would also review the Terms of Service provided to users to assess the clarity and transparency of the consent process. Additionally, I would gather feedback from both the volunteers and the users of Crisis Text Line to understand their perspectives and concerns regarding the data-sharing arrangement. Based on this information, I would work with the leadership team to determine the best course of action moving forward, which may include revising the data-sharing practices, enhancing user consent processes, and improving communication with volunteers and users about how their data is being used.
