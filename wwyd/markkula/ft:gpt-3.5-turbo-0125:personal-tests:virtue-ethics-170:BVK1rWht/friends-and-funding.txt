I would recuse myself from the vote and inform the Senate about the conflict of interest. I would explain the situation honestly, emphasizing the importance of maintaining fairness and impartiality in the decision-making process. I would suggest that the Senate postpone the vote until a later meeting when more senators are present to ensure a quorum and a more representative decision-making process.
