I would conduct a thorough review of the smart lamppost project in Hong Kong to understand the specific surveillance capabilities of the lampposts and assess the level of privacy invasion they may pose. I would then work with relevant stakeholders, including government officials, technology experts, privacy advocates, and community representatives, to address the concerns raised by the protesters and the public. This would involve transparently communicating the findings of the review, discussing potential modifications to the lampposts to enhance privacy protections, and establishing clear guidelines for the use of surveillance features to ensure they are not abused for intrusive purposes. Additionally, I would explore ways to rebuild trust with the public and mitigate any potential security risks associated with the smart lampposts.
