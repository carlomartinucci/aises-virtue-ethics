I would review the process and technology used by First Date to verify user avatars against photo IDs to ensure that it is secure and respects user privacy. I would also assess the effectiveness of this verification process in preventing fraudulent activity and ensuring the safety of users. Additionally, I would investigate the partnerships with online delivery services and content providers to confirm that they are reputable and provide a positive experience for users.
