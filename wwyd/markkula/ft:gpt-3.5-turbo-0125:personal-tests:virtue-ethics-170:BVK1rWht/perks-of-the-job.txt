I would schedule a private meeting with Julia to discuss the issue. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about the misuse of office resources and supplies for personal homework. I would explain that while I appreciate her dedication and hard work for the organization, it is important to adhere to the rules and guidelines set by the student government regarding the use of resources. I would suggest finding alternative solutions, such as using her own personal resources for homework or finding a compromise that respects the organization's budget constraints. I would emphasize the importance of setting a good example for other members and maintaining transparency and integrity within the organization.
