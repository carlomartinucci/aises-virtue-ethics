I would step down from my position in the outdoor club for the time being to avoid any potential conflict of interest. I would communicate openly and honestly with the club members about my decision, explaining that I need to prioritize my role in Associated Students and maintain neutrality in the petitioning process. I would assure them that I support the club's growth and success, and that stepping down temporarily does not diminish my commitment to the club's mission. I would also offer to assist in finding a suitable replacement or provide guidance during the transition period to ensure the club continues to thrive in my absence.
