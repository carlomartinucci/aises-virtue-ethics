I would conduct a thorough investigation into the situation, including gathering all available information about the emails, their content, the circumstances surrounding their release, and the public response to them. I would also review the company's code of conduct and policies to determine if any violations occurred. Additionally, I would consult with legal counsel to understand any potential legal implications for the company and its stakeholders. Based on the findings of the investigation, I would recommend appropriate actions to the board of directors, which may include disciplinary measures for Spiegel, such as a public apology, sensitivity training, or even his removal from the CEO position if deemed necessary to protect the company's reputation and values.
