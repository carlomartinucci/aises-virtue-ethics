If I were Akira, I would calmly explain to the upset senator the importance of maintaining confidentiality in discussing sensitive disciplinary matters involving individual members of the student government. I would emphasize that this is not about hiding information but rather about respecting the privacy and dignity of the individuals involved. I would assure the senator that the decision-making process will be fair and transparent, and that any relevant information will be shared with the student body at the appropriate time. If the senator continues to insist on staying, I would politely but firmly ask them to respect the confidentiality of the meeting and to leave the room to allow the executive board to deliberate on the matter privately.
