I would review the company's policies and procedures regarding rehiring terminated employees, particularly in cases where new information, such as a medical diagnosis, is disclosed after termination. I would then schedule a meeting with relevant stakeholders, including HR, legal, and management, to discuss Matt's request for reinstatement in light of his ASD disclosure. During the meeting, I would advocate for a fair and thorough review of the situation, taking into consideration both the initial breach of company policy and the new information about Matt's diagnosis. I would also ensure that any decision made is in compliance with relevant employment laws and regulations.
