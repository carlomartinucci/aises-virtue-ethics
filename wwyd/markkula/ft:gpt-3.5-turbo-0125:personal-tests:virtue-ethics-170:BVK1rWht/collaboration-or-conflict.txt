I would schedule a face-to-face meeting with Alanna to express my concerns about the lack of communication and collaboration between student government and RHA. During the meeting, I would emphasize the importance of the event to the student body and the positive impact of our past collaborations. I would listen to Alanna's perspective and try to understand any challenges or issues she may be facing. I would propose a clear plan of action with specific deadlines and responsibilities for both organizations to ensure the event's success. If Alanna continues to be uncooperative, I would involve our respective advisors to mediate the situation and find a resolution that benefits both organizations and the student body.
