I would advise Jessica to respect Adam's request to omit his name from the article. I would suggest that she explain to Adam the importance of maintaining his anonymity for his safety and well-being. I would recommend that Jessica focus on highlighting the content of Adam's testimonial and the impact of immigration policy on students without compromising his identity. Additionally, I would suggest that Jessica consider including information about the reasons for Adam's anonymity in the article to provide transparency to her readers.
