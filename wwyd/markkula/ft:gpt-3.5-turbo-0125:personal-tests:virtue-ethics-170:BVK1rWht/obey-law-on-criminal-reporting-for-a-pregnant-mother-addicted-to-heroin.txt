I would have a detailed discussion with the patient about the legal implications of her drug use during pregnancy, including the mandatory reporting requirements in our state. I would explain the potential consequences of reporting, such as immediate access to inpatient drug treatment but also the risk of a criminal record or involvement with child protective services. I would also discuss the benefits of seeking treatment voluntarily and the support available to her.

I would then work with her to develop a comprehensive treatment plan that includes medical and social support for her heroin addiction during pregnancy. This plan would focus on her and her baby's well-being, with the goal of achieving a drug-free pregnancy and ensuring the best possible outcome for both of them. I would provide her with information on available resources, such as addiction treatment programs, prenatal care, and counseling services, and help her access these services.

Throughout the pregnancy, I would closely monitor her progress and provide ongoing support and encouragement. I would also involve other healthcare professionals, such as addiction specialists and social workers, to ensure she receives comprehensive care.

I would respect her autonomy and decision-making capacity while also emphasizing the importance of seeking help and support to protect the health and well-being of herself and her baby.
