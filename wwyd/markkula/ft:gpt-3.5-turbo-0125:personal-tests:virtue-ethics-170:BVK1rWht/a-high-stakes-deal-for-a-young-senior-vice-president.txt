I would advise Tim to firmly refuse the bribe offered by Sam and to report the situation to the appropriate authorities within his company. Tim should explain the situation truthfully, emphasizing the attempted bribery and the altered agreement presented by Sam. He should also seek guidance from the company's legal department or compliance team to ensure that the deal is conducted ethically and in compliance with all regulations. Additionally, Tim should document all interactions and evidence related to the attempted bribery for his own protection and to assist in any potential investigations. By taking these steps, Tim can uphold his integrity, protect his reputation, and ensure that the deal is conducted in a transparent and lawful manner.
