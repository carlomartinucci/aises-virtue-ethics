I would conduct a thorough review of the proctoring software being used at our institution to identify any potential biases in the system, particularly in face detection algorithms. I would collaborate with the IT department and relevant stakeholders to assess the impact of the software on students and professors. Based on this review, I would make a recommendation to the administration on whether to continue using the software, implement changes to address biases, or explore alternative solutions for exam monitoring.
