I would first review the specific details of the vulnerabilities discovered by Google's security research team in Microsoft software. Then, I would assess the severity and potential impact of these vulnerabilities on users and systems. Next, I would communicate with the team that discovered the vulnerabilities to understand their rationale for adhering strictly to the 90-day disclosure policy.

Following this, I would reach out to Microsoft to discuss the vulnerabilities, the potential risks they pose, and the timeline for releasing patches. I would emphasize the importance of collaboration in addressing these vulnerabilities to ensure the security of users. Additionally, I would propose a meeting between Google's security team and Microsoft's developers to facilitate a coordinated effort in resolving the issues.

Furthermore, I would engage with industry experts and stakeholders to gather diverse perspectives on responsible disclosure practices and the implications of immediate public disclosure versus coordinated vulnerability disclosure. This information would help inform future decisions on disclosure policies and practices within the organization.

Finally, I would work with the relevant teams to prepare a detailed report on the vulnerabilities, the communication with Microsoft, the proposed solutions, and the overall lessons learned from this incident. This report would serve as a valuable resource for improving the organization's approach to responsible disclosure in the future.
