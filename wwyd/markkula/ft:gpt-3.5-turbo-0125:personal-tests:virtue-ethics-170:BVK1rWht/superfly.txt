I would carefully review the terms and conditions of SuperFly to ensure that all information provided to customers is transparent and accurate. I would verify that the pricing structure is clearly outlined, including any additional fees for customization options. I would also confirm that the confidentiality agreement with the smartraVeleR consultant is clearly explained to customers, emphasizing the protection of their personal information and travel preferences. Additionally, I would ensure that the environmental benefits of using SuperFly are accurately represented, providing customers with clear information on how the service contributes to reducing their carbon footprint.
