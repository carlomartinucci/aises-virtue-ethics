I would advise James to reconsider his decision to rent several black Mercedes Benz sports cars to drive students to classes on Election Day. While it may be within the rules to spend money on such a campaign tactic, it could be seen as unfair and potentially unethical given the significant advantage he already has over his opponent, Alix, in terms of resources. Instead, I would suggest that James redirect some of the funds allocated for the sports cars towards supporting Alix's campaign efforts, such as by offering to share some of his advertising space or providing financial assistance for her marketing initiatives. This would help level the playing field and ensure a more equitable competition between the candidates.
