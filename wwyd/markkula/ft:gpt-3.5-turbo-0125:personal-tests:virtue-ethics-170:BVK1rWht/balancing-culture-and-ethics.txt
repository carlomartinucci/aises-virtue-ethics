I would thank the villagers for their warm hospitality and express my gratitude for the opportunity to learn about their community and the new business development. I would acknowledge the positive impact the business has had on providing additional income for the families in the village. However, I would also express my concerns about the involvement of children in the labor at such a young age, highlighting the potential risks to their health and well-being. I would suggest exploring alternative ways to support the families economically that do not involve child labor, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing the children's education and overall development.
