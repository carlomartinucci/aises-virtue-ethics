I would respect the student's request for anonymity in the article, as he is not a vulnerable source in need of special protection. However, I would include a brief note in the article acknowledging that the student requested to remain anonymous due to concerns about potential social ostracization. This way, the article maintains transparency while also respecting the student's wishes.
