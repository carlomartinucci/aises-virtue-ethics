I would conduct a thorough internal review of the decision-making process that led to Mayor Schaaf's announcement of the ICE raids. This review would involve gathering all relevant information, including the sources of the information about the raids, the potential risks and benefits of making the announcement, and the legal and ethical considerations involved. I would also interview key stakeholders, such as Mayor Schaaf, city officials, and law enforcement personnel, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the situation. Based on the findings of the review, I would develop recommendations for how to handle similar situations in the future, taking into account the need to balance public safety, transparency, and legal obligations.
