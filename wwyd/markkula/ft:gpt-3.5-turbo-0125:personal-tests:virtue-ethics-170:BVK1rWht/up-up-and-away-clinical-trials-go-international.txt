I would immediately raise concerns within the company about the ethical implications of the clinical trial conducted in Russia. I would advocate for a thorough review of the informed consent process used with the trial participants, highlighting the lack of relevant educational background and potential misunderstanding of the risks and benefits involved in the trial. I would recommend that the company take responsibility for ensuring ongoing access to the medication and medical care for the trial participants, even after the trial has ended. Additionally, I would suggest establishing a communication channel for the participants to reach out to the doctors who took care of them during the trial for any follow-up care or questions they may have.
