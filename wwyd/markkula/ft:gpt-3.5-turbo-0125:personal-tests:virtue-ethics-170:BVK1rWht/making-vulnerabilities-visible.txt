I would reach out to the creators of PunkSpider, particularly Alejandro Carceres, to discuss the potential risks associated with publicly disclosing unpatched vulnerabilities. I would suggest implementing additional safeguards in the tool to prevent malicious actors from exploiting the vulnerabilities before website administrators have a chance to address them. This could include a delay in making certain vulnerabilities public or providing a secure platform for website administrators to receive notifications about vulnerabilities affecting their sites. Additionally, I would recommend conducting a thorough risk assessment to identify and mitigate any unintended consequences of releasing this tool to the public.
