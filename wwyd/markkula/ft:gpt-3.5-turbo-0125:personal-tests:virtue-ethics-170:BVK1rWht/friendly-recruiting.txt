I would first review the applications of the remaining candidates to see if any of them have relevant experience or skills that could potentially make them suitable for the specific committees. If I find a candidate who could be a good fit, I would assign them to the respective committee.

If after reviewing the applications I still feel that none of the remaining candidates are suitable for the specific committees, I would reach out to the candidates individually to discuss their interests, skills, and potential contributions to the committees. I would try to gauge their willingness to learn and adapt to the requirements of the committees.

If, after these discussions, I still believe that my friends would be the best fit for the committees, I would inform the candidates that I have identified other individuals who may be better suited for the positions and offer them the opportunity to apply for other available positions or get involved in other ways within the student government. I would then encourage my friends to apply for the positions and go through the same selection process as the other candidates.
