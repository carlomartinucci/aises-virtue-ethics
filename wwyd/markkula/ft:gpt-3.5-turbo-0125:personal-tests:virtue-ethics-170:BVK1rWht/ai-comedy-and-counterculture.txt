I would immediately reach out to the George Carlin estate and offer my assistance in ensuring that all unauthorized AI-generated content featuring George Carlin is removed from the internet. I would also offer to help monitor for any potential future instances of such content being created and distributed without permission. Additionally, I would suggest collaborating with the estate to create a clear and comprehensive strategy for protecting Carlin's legacy from unauthorized AI-generated works in the future.
