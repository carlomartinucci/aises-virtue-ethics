I would review the uploaded content on the VR Rage Room app regularly to ensure that all scenarios and objects comply with the terms of service prohibiting violence against humans. If I come across any content that violates this rule, I would immediately remove it from the platform and notify the user responsible for the upload about the violation. Additionally, I would provide clear guidelines and examples of acceptable content to help users understand the boundaries of what is allowed on the app.
