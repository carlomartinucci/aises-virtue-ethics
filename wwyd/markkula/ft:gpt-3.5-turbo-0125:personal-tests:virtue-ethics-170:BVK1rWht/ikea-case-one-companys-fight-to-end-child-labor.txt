I would work with the suppliers in India to implement a comprehensive monitoring and auditing system to ensure that child labor is not being used in the production of rugs for IKEA. This system would involve regular on-site visits to production sites, conducting surprise raids, and working closely with local authorities to enforce compliance with India's Child Labor (Prohibition and Regulation) Act of 1986. Additionally, I would collaborate with non-governmental organizations and local communities to provide support and resources to families in need, in order to address the root causes of child labor in the region.
