I would thank Alexandra for sharing her story and expressing her concerns. I would explain to her that I understand her fears and respect her decision to remain anonymous in the article. I would assure her that her confidentiality will be strictly maintained and that her story will be shared in a sensitive and respectful manner.

To address my concerns about perpetuating taboos surrounding sexual assault, I would include a statement in the article emphasizing that survivors have different reasons for choosing to remain anonymous and that their decision should be respected. I would also highlight the importance of supporting survivors and creating a safe environment for them to come forward.

Additionally, I would reach out to the campus advocacy groups, such as the Violence Prevention Program and Feminists for Justice, to get their perspectives on the issue and include their viewpoints in the article. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the potential impact of the federal guidelines on survivors of sexual assault on college campuses.
