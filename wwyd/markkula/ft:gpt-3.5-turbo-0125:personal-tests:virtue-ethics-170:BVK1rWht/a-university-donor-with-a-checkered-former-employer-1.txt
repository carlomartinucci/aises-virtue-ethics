I would thank the donor for their interest in supporting the university and for their willingness to make a donation. I would express gratitude for their desire to give back to the community. I would then inform the donor that the university is committed to upholding ethical standards and values, including a focus on diversity and inclusion in STEM education. I would explain that the university carefully considers the background and values of potential donors to ensure alignment with its mission.

I would then request a meeting with the donor to discuss their intentions further and to learn more about their personal values and motivations for supporting the university. During the meeting, I would ask the donor about their views on diversity and inclusion in education, as well as their thoughts on the importance of ethical business practices. Based on the conversation and the donor's responses, I would evaluate whether their values align with those of the university.

If, after the meeting, I determine that the donor's values are in line with the university's commitment to diversity and ethical practices, I would proceed with accepting the donation. I would also discuss with the donor the possibility of earmarking their donation specifically for scholarships or programs that support underrepresented students in STEM fields. If, however, I find that the donor's values do not align with the university's mission and values, I would politely decline the donation and explain the reasons for the decision.
