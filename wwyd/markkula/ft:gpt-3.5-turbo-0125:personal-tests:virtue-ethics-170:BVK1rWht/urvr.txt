I would review the company's data retention policies and procedures to ensure that they are being followed accurately. I would verify that all 360 degree videos and images are indeed deleted within 24 hours unless the user specifies otherwise. I would also check that there are no backups or copies of the content stored on any servers after the specified time period. If I find any discrepancies or violations of the data retention policy, I would escalate the issue to the appropriate department for immediate correction.
