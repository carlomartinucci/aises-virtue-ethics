I would first ensure Julia's immediate safety by confiscating the bottle of pain medication and ensuring she does not have access to any other harmful substances. I would then conduct a thorough assessment of her current mental health status, including asking direct questions about suicidal thoughts and intentions. I would also explore her past experiences with treatment for depression to understand her reluctance and potential triggers for her current distress. I would provide a safe and non-judgmental space for her to express her feelings and concerns. If Julia continues to refuse additional diagnostic tests or treatment options, I would respect her autonomy while emphasizing the importance of addressing her mental health for her overall well-being. I would collaborate with the school psychologist and other mental health professionals involved in her care to develop a safety plan and provide ongoing support and monitoring.
