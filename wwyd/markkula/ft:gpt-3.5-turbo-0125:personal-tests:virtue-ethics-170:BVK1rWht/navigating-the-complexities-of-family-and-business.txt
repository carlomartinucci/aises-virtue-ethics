I would first try to have a private conversation with Donald to understand his motivations and concerns better. I would explain to him the financial implications of selling the building and the significant tax burden that would result. I would propose exploring other options, such as hiring professionals to manage the business or finding alternative ways to generate income from the building. I would emphasize the importance of preserving the family legacy and the potential long-term benefits of keeping the business running. If Donald remains adamant about selling the building, I would then discuss the situation with the other shareholders to see if a compromise can be reached that considers both financial and familial interests. I would also seek advice from a financial advisor or legal expert to explore all possible solutions and their implications.
