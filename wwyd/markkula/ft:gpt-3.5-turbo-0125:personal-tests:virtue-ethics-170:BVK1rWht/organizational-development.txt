I would first gather input from the student government members about the importance of the retreat and its impact on their leadership development and effectiveness in serving the student body. I would also seek feedback on potential alternatives to the coastal retreat site that may be more cost-effective while still providing a valuable experience. Based on this information, I would then make a decision on whether to allocate the additional funds from the student government budget for the retreat or explore other options that may be more financially sustainable.
