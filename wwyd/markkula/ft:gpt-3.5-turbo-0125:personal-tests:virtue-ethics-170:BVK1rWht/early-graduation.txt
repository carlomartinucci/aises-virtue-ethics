I would have a conversation with the senior members of the student government to discuss my situation and the potential impact of my early graduation on the organization. I would explain my passion for the role and the initiatives I have planned, but also be transparent about my impending graduation and the implications for my term as a senior class senator. I would seek their advice on how to proceed, considering the best interests of the student government as a whole. If they advise me to find another way to participate or suggest alternative solutions, I would carefully consider their input and make a decision based on the collective welfare of the organization.
