I would immediately address the client's fantasy of stalking Susan and her new boyfriend. I would explain to him that such behavior is inappropriate, illegal, and could potentially harm Susan and her boyfriend. I would explore with him the underlying emotions that are driving this fantasy and work on developing healthier coping mechanisms to deal with rejection and jealousy. I would also assess the risk of harm to Susan and her boyfriend and take appropriate steps to ensure their safety, such as involving law enforcement if necessary.
