I would work to ensure that the voices of the Navajo tribe are included in the negotiations and discussions regarding water allocation from the Colorado River. This would involve advocating for the Navajo Nation to be actively involved in decision-making processes related to water rights and allocations, as well as pushing for their concerns and needs to be addressed and prioritized. Additionally, I would support efforts to implement safe and reliable water sources for all members of the Navajo Nation, in line with principles of environmental justice and human rights.
