I would advise Dave to immediately stop the arrangement with Alex and report the illegal activities of the non-profit managers to the appropriate authorities. Dave should also seek guidance from his organization's leadership on how to proceed in a way that upholds ethical standards and ensures that the donor funds are used appropriately for the intended purpose of building houses for the poor. Additionally, Dave should work with his organization to implement proper oversight and controls to prevent similar unethical practices in the future.
