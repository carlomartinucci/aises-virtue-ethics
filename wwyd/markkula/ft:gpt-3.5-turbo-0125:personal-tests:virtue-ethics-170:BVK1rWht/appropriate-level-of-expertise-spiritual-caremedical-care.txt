I would express my deep concern for John's well-being and emphasize the seriousness of the situation. I would stress the importance of seeking professional help from a doctor or counselor, especially given his history of alcoholism and the recent relapse. I would offer to accompany him to his doctor's appointment or to an AA meeting for support. I would also involve other church members who may have experience with similar issues to provide additional support and resources for John.
