I would schedule individual meetings with each board member to discuss their level of engagement and commitment to the organization. During these meetings, I would clearly communicate the organization's goals and the importance of active participation from all board members. I would seek to understand any barriers preventing their engagement and work collaboratively to address those issues. Additionally, I would provide specific examples of how their involvement can make a meaningful impact on the organization and the community it serves.
