I would build and deploy a caller-facing opt-out feature in the MetLife IVR flow so that every incoming customer hears, right after “Thank you for calling MetLife,” a one‐sentence prompt, for example:  
“Please note: this conversation will be analyzed in real time to gauge emotion and improve service. To continue without analysis, press 3 now.”  

Concrete steps:  
1. Work with the IVR (interactive voice response) team to add a new menu option (“press 3”) immediately after the standard welcome message.  
2. Update the call‐routing logic so that if the caller presses 3, the IVR flags the call record with a “no-analysis” tag and routes it to agents without loading the Cogito overlay.  
3. Modify the agent desktop application to check that “no-analysis” flag before launching the Cogito panel; if flagged, the panel never appears and no emotional metrics are recorded.  
4. Log all opt-out selections in the CRM so supervisors can report on opt-out rates and any impact on customer satisfaction.  
5. Train agents during their next team meeting on how to handle calls that bypass the analysis system (e.g., no heart or cup icons will appear).  

This change ensures every customer is explicitly informed about—and can decline—real-time emotional analysis.
