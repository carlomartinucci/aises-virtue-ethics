Here’s exactly what I would do, step by step, if I were Bruce:

1. Gather and Confirm Documentation  
   • Pull together Spencer’s ESA documentation and medical provider letter.  
   • Email Spencer a short form acknowledging receipt and confirming that the organization is initiating its accommodation process.

2. Meet with HR/Risk Manager (Day 1–2)  
   • Schedule a 30-minute Zoom with HR to review California’s ESA/service-animal rules and the “undue hardship” standard.  
   • Get HR’s template for an official “Reasonable Accommodation Agreement.”  

3. Draw Up an Accommodation Plan (Day 2–3)  
   In a one-page memo, I’ll propose:  
   a. Private Single Dorm Room for Spencer and dog (as required).  
   b. A “Dog-Allowed Office” (20 × 10 ft) with vinyl flooring I’ll reserve in Building C—this lets Spencer meet students and do prep work with his dog.  
   c. A separate “Dog-Free Office” down the hall for allergy-sensitive staff.  
   d. A weekly cleaning contract for both offices (additional $50/week).  
   e. A private back-seat on the program bus with a secured dog crate and harness attachment point.  
   f. A daily log for dog presence (to track any complaints and respond immediately).

4. Identify and Inform Affected Staff/Students (Day 3–4)  
   • Send a two-sentence email to all summer-program staff: “We’re adding an emotional-support dog in Building C. If you have allergies or fear of dogs, please contact me by Friday 5 PM and we’ll arrange alternative workspaces or duties.”  
   • Post a small “Dog in Use—ESA” sign on the Building C office door.  
   • Add a one-line note in next week’s student-orientation packet: “We will have a certified ESA in our dog-friendly work area. Let us know if you need dog-free zones.”

5. Adjust Housing and Transportation Logistics (Day 5–7)  
   • Call the university’s housing office: convert one single dorm into Spencer’s ESA suite—confirm no extra nightly fee for a single room.  
   • Reserve the back-row seat on each program bus run; buy or borrow a steel-frame crate and harness anchor (approx. $200 one-time).  
   • Get students’ consent forms for bus seating (add a checkbox about “I consent to sitting in the same bus if a certified ESA is present”).

6. Finalize Offer Letter and Accommodation Agreement (Day 7)  
   • Update Spencer’s written offer: include clause “Accommodation: single room, office space, bus crate.”  
   • Attach the “Reasonable Accommodation Agreement” for Spencer to sign, detailing his responsibilities (e.g., dog must be leashed, vaccinated, crate kept clean).

7. Run a Trial Week and Monitor (Program Week 1)  
   • During the first week of program, I’ll collect any incident reports or allergy complaints.  
   • If someone on staff or a student reports a dog-related problem, I’ll address it within 24 hours—either by moving that person’s workspace or, if truly untenable, providing noise-canceling headphones and relocating them to the dog-free office.

8. Track Costs and Outcomes (Ongoing)  
   • Enter cleaning, crate, housing-upgrade, and any other expenses into our finance spreadsheet under “ESA Accommodation.”  
   • At program’s end, compare those to the added value of Spencer’s AI teaching and student-engagement metrics (e.g., student survey scores).  

By following these concrete steps, I would both comply with California law and minimize disruptions. This plan gives Spencer the ESA support he needs while clearly delineating dog-free areas and fallback procedures for anyone allergic or fearful.
