1. Draft a one‐page Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) for Jamie. In it I would:  
   • List the exact commitments he has missed (e.g. “Missed 3 of the last 4 weekly meetings,” “Did not reply to Council emails within 48 hours”).  
   • State the target behaviors (“Attend every weekly meeting for the next four weeks,” “Acknowledge or respond to all Council emails within 24 hours”).  
   • Specify the methods of proof (meeting attendance logs, email “read” receipts or responses).  
   • Set a four‐week deadline for full compliance.  

2. Call Jamie in for a private meeting before the next weekly session and walk him through the PIP.  
   • Ask him to sign the PIP so that we share a clear understanding of expectations and timeline.  
   • Offer him a “backup buddy” on the executive council—another officer who will give him meeting notes immediately after each session and remind him of deadlines via a group chat.  

3. Adjust his workload temporarily. If Jamie accepts the PIP:  
   • Reassign one lower‐priority project from his portfolio to another council member for the four‐week probation period.  
   • Make clear that, if he meets all PIP targets, he will get his full portfolio back.  

4. Conduct weekly check‐in meetings for the duration of the PIP.  
   • Review attendance records and email logs together.  
   • Have the “backup buddy” confirm that Jamie received notes and reminders.  
   • Record each check‐in on a shared Google doc so Margaret and Jamie can see progress.  

5. At the end of four weeks:  
   • If Jamie has met every target, remove the probation status, return his full duties, and thank him for stepping up.  
   • If he has missed any targets, hold a final review meeting, remove him from the executive council roster, and reassign his portfolio permanently. Then post an open call among eligible student government members to fill the vacancy.
