1. That afternoon, I’d walk into the local office, gather all twelve uncashed checks I’ve written to Alex over the past year, and tear them up in front of my DR team.  2. I’d immediately email the U.S. finance director at my parent organization, attach copies of my bank‐deposit stubs showing the peso amounts I received from Alex, and request a teleconference first thing tomorrow to disclose the black-market arrangement.  3. During that call, I’d hand over:  
   • A spreadsheet listing each monthly $30,000 check, its deposit date, and the peso total I received.  
   • Alex’s company name, address, and details of our deal (200,000 pesos per $30K check).  
   • A recommendation that the U.S. office commission an external forensic audit of both our DR partner NGO and Alex’s sandpaper business.  
4. I’d cut Alex out of any further checks, notify him by text that I can no longer route funds through his firm, and offer to pay him the small official‐rate spread (4 pesos per dollar) within 48 hours for any outstanding balance I owe—on the condition that he provide formal invoices and bank receipts. 5. I’d spend the next two days in the DR capital working with the U.S. office’s in-country financial controller to open an official-dollar account (in the NGO’s name) at one of the authorized exchange banks, learn exactly how to queue for government FX, and draft a step-by-step process so that each month we deposit our USD gift checks into that official account and convert at the 4:1 rate—even though it slows construction. 6. Finally, I’d inform the local NGO managers that as of this week we’ll be using strictly legal exchange channels, share with them the new standard operating procedure in writing, and set up weekly check-in calls to make sure all cash flows are transparent, bank-verified, and documented for our U.S. auditors.
