1. Gather and document my actual hours and tasks  
   • Export my weekly timesheets and save PDFs showing hours charged to Company Z, training, and administrative codes.  
   • Attach copies of Ted’s and Fred’s emails/comments about “dialing back” hours and the firm’s training-completion notices.  
   • Write a one-page memo with dates, hours worked, and discrepancies between estimated and actual audit-completion hours.

2. Call the firm’s Ethics & Compliance Hotline  
   • Dial the internal hotline number I found in the employee handbook.  
   • When prompted, select “audit quality concerns” and “time recording integrity.”  
   • Provide my employee ID, then read from my memo: outline that managers have pressured the team to underreport audit hours and are unclear on how to book weekend compliance training.  
   • Ask what guidance exists for properly classifying hours in situations where budgeted audit time is insufficient and “training” occurs off-site on weekends.

3. Send a follow-up email to the Quality & Risk Management partner and National Office Resource team  
   • To: QRM Partner (Carol), cc: National Office Resource & Quality (no reply-all to Fred or Ted)  
   • Subject: Urgent: Time Reporting and Training Classification on Company Z Engagement  
   • Body:  
     – Briefly summarize the hotline call and attach my memo, emails, and timesheet PDFs.  
     – Request written confirmation of the correct time-charging policy before I submit my next timesheet.  
     – State that I will follow whatever classification they confirm, but I need that guidance to comply with firm standards and PCAOB requirements.

4. Pause any further adjustments to my timesheet until I receive formal guidance  
   • Continue logging all hours honestly in my private draft timesheet.  
   • Do not reallocate audit hours to training or admin codes without explicit, documented approval from the QRM partner or National Office.  

5. Complete required training by the firm deadline using personal time if necessary  
   • Schedule my compliance training modules for weeknights after client hours if the policy prohibits weekend billing.  
   • If policy allows weekend billing for required training, charge those hours only to the training code once I have received written approval in step 3.  
   • Notify my teammates of the official policy once clarified so we all comply uniformly.
