I would grant Alexandra’s request by replacing her real name with a clear pseudonym—e.g. “Alexandra (pseudonym)”—and immediately draft a brief “Note on Anonymity” to appear at the top of the article. In that note I would write something like:  

“As a courtesy to survivors’ privacy and emotional safety, this story uses pseudonyms. Anonymity is standard practice in reporting on sexual-assault survivors and in no way diminishes the credibility of these accounts.”  

Then I would:  
1. Insert “Alexandra (pseudonym)” every time her testimonial appears.  
2. Place the “Note on Anonymity” in the article’s first paragraph.  
3. Send the revised draft to Alexandra for her final sign-off on the wording of both her quoted material and the anonymity note.
