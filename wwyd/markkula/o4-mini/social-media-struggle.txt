I would open Facebook Messenger, find John’s profile, and send him a one‐paragraph note along these lines:  
“Hey John—just saw your chugging video with the SG sweatshirt on. It’s set to friends only, but people in the organization have already seen it and are worried about liability and our reputation. Could you please delete the post by the end of today? If you need help downloading it for your own archive first, let me know. Thanks.”
