1. Draft and circulate an e-mail to all clubs by Friday afternoon announcing a “Proposal Tune-Up Workshop” next Wednesday from 3–5 pm in Student Union room 214.  
2. In that e-mail, attach the standard funding-proposal rubric and ask every club to RSVP by Tuesday noon with a copy of their draft proposal.  
3. Block out two one-hour slots on Drake’s calendar that afternoon as “Proposal Workshop—drop-in advising.”  
4. Tell Alex: “I’m hosting that open workshop next Wednesday. Bring your draft there, and I’ll walk every club through the same set of comments step by step.”  
5. Prepare for the workshop by printing one copy of each submitted draft, highlighting in advance any missing line-items or unclear justifications according to the rubric.  
6. During the workshop, address Alex and every other group one at a time: read aloud question by question from the rubric, point out common omissions, suggest precise wording tweaks (e.g., replacing “equipment costs” with “10 microphones at \$50 each”), and annotate each copy in real time.  
7. After the workshop, upload all annotated drafts (with reviewer initials redacted) to the shared drive so every club can download not only their own feedback but examples of peer proposals and commentary.
