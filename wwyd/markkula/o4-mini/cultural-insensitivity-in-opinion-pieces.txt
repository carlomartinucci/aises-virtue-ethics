1. Call an immediate meeting with Ishmael and me (as the section editor) to review his draft line by line. I’d point out the “frog eyes rolling in your mouth” simile and ask him to suggest two or three alternate humorous comparisons that don’t single out boba’s Taiwanese origins. For example, “chewy marbles in pudding” or “gumdrops lost in soda.”  
2. While Ishmael works on replacements, email the Taiwanese Student Association president to arrange a 15-minute read-through of the revised lines. I’d send them just the new simile options and ask for a quick thumbs-up or thumbs-down by the end of the day.  
3. If at least one of Ishmael’s new similes passes the TSA’s review without comment, slot that version into the article.  
4. Add a one-sentence editor’s note at the top of the opinion page: “The following piece uses satire to critique the taste and texture of boba. We welcome alternative viewpoints and cultural insights—see Jennifer’s upcoming column for more.”  
5. Publish both opinion pieces side by side: Ishmael’s revised critique on page A6, Jennifer’s defense of boba on page A7, with a shared box directing readers to an online forum where they can post respectful responses.
