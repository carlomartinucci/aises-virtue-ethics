I’d take the following concrete step as soon as I walked into the boardroom as one of the newly appointed directors:  

1. Within 48 hours, engage a reputable outside employment‐law firm (for example, Littler Mendelson or Ogletree Deakins) under a written retainer to perform two tasks simultaneously:  
   a. A forensic review of every sexual-harassment complaint, investigation report, employee signed “sexually charged workplace” acknowledgments, and expense report going back at least five years.  
   b. A confidential, floor-by-floor, one-on-one interview program with every production-floor and retail-store employee, plus a random sample of headquarters staff, to surface any remaining incidents or patterns of misconduct.  

2. At the same time, finalize and roll out an anonymous whistle-blower hotline managed by that same law firm, with a guaranteed 72-hour response commitment and a weekly summary (redacted to protect privacy) to the full board.  

3. Within 10 days of that kickoff, convene an all-staff town hall—led by the chair of the audit/ethics committee and the lead partner from the outside firm—to announce:  
   • The completion date for the forensic review (no more than six weeks away).  
   • The hotline number and a clear promise that no retaliation will be tolerated.  
   • The immediate suspension of any marketing or advertising campaign that features overtly sexualized imagery until it passes a new “respectful‐workplace” review by a subcommittee of the full board.  

By locking in an outside‐law-firm investigation, an anonymous reporting channel, and a freeze on sex-driven ads, the board both stabilizes governance and signals to employees, investors, and retailers that this is no longer Dov Charney’s operation.
