I would carve out one of my current UA‐Committee projects and turn it into a joint “Returnee Experience” working group that serves both my constituents and the committee’s agenda. Here’s exactly how I’d do it:  
1. Identify a UA project I can hand off. For example, if I’m running weekly dining‐hall satisfaction surveys, I’d choose that because student dining feedback is already being collected by another senator.  
2. Draft a one‐page “handover memo” outlining the dining‐hall survey’s status, timeline, key contacts (dining‐services manager, survey platform admin, data‐analysis TA) and outstanding tasks. Email it to the senator who’s best placed to take it over, cc’ing the UA committee chair and the dining‐services liaison.  
3. Immediately after, schedule a 30-minute meeting with the three juniors just back from abroad whom I’ve already met informally. Tell them: “I’m launching a new ‘Returnee Experience’ group. I need your firsthand perspective to design an official survey, a housing‐referral map, and an academic‐credit checklist.” Ask each to commit 2 hours over the next two weeks.  
4. Build the survey: spend one afternoon drafting a 10-question Google Form (housing, credit transfer, social reintegration). Share the draft in Slack with those three students. Collect their feedback, finalize the survey in 48 hours.  
5. Book a two-hour pop-up office hour in the student center next Wednesday, advertise it on class Facebook pages and in the study-abroad office. Bring printouts of the survey, a campus map, and a signup sheet for 15-minute help slots.  
6. Simultaneously, at the next UA committee meeting, propose turning the “Returnee Experience” findings into a sub‐project under university‐services improvements: “Incorporate data on returning students’ housing and credit needs into the next campus‐services strategic plan.” Distribute the survey results and suggest co‐sponsoring the initiative with the Housing & Dining subcommittee.  
7. Over the following month, lead two focused feedback sessions: one with the director of housing services and one with the registrar’s office. Take minutes, record action items (for example, “housing office to draft five one-page referral handouts by June 15; registrar to publish an online credit‐transfer flowchart by July 1”).  
8. Finally, publicize each milestone to my constituents via a weekly “Returnee Roundup” email and a two-paragraph update on the class newsletter. Track open rates and attendance at office hours.  

By handing off a routine UA project in a structured way and replacing it with a targeted, constituent‐driven initiative that still advances campus services, I both stay active on the committee’s scoreboard and spend real time solving my classmates’ most urgent post-abroad problems.
