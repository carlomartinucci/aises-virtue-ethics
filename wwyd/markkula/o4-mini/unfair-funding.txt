1. Revise the funding‐request form so that every proposal is stripped of identifying information (club name, president’s name, logos) before it goes to the committee.  I would work with ITS or our student‐government webmaster today to create a version of the online form that automatically redacts those fields and replaces them with a unique proposal ID.  
2. Draft and circulate a detailed scoring rubric with exact point values for each evaluation category—e.g. outreach potential (0–10), budget clarity (0–5), demonstrated past‐use effectiveness (0–5), alignment with school priorities (0–10).  I would email the committee the rubric this afternoon and schedule a 30-minute training session before our next meeting.  
3. Require that all committee members annotate each rubric immediately upon reading a proposal, before any group discussion begins.  I’d hand out printed score sheets at the start of the meeting and collect them before opening discussion.  
4. Continue to allow Garret to submit and present his club’s proposals, but enforce the same blind‐review process on him: he would upload his materials to the anonymized form and still abstain from discussion and voting.  
5. After two funding cycles under this new system, I would pull the anonymized scores and compare average scores and approval rates across all clubs.  If Garret’s club still disproportionally outperforms others by more than, say, 20%, I would bring that analysis to the student‐government floor and propose either a temporary cap (for that club only) or an extra review stage for high-scoring proposals to ensure balance.
