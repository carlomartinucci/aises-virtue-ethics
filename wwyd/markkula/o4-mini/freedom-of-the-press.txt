1. Draft a two-minute “Trending on Campus” segment that opens with a 5-second slow pan of the statue, overlaid with the title card “What Students Are Really Saying about Our New Statue.”  
2. Write a shot list:  
   • 10–12 vox-pop interviews with students (20–30 seconds each) saying one joke or critique about the statue.  
   • 5–8 seconds of B-roll of the statue from multiple angles (morning light, students walking by, close-ups of details).  
3. Recruit a small crew (one camera operator, one sound person, one assistant) and set up outside the statue at peak foot-traffic times (between classes, lunchtime).  
4. Approach students with a clipboard and a sign that reads “SG Video: Quick Question”—capture on-the-spot one-liner reactions (e.g. “It looks like a giant paperweight,” “We’re definitely brown-nosing donors,” “It’s like a spaceship crash-landed here.”)  
5. After collecting at least 10 usable sound bites, transfer footage to your editing workstation and assemble:  
   • 0:00–0:05 Establishing shot of statue  
   • 0:06–0:20 Title card and music sting  
   • 0:21–1:30 Montage of student jokes (intercut with B-roll)  
   • 1:31–1:55 Quick wrap-up: “Those are just a few of the hot takes you’re hearing around campus—what do you think?”  
   • 1:56–2:00 End card with Student Government logo and social-media handles  
6. Export a draft video in MP4, upload to a private Student Government folder, and email the communications officer and one friendly admin liaison with a note: “Here’s a raw cut of the Trending segment on the new statue—upload scheduled next Wednesday unless there’s a request for edits by Friday.”  
7. On Wednesday morning, publish the video on SG’s official Instagram and TikTok accounts, pin a comment inviting alumni or donors to send in their own impressions, and track view counts and comments for reporting back to the student body.
