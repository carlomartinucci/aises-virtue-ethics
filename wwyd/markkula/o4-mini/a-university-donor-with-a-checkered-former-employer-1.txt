1. Pull up the university’s Gift Acceptance Policy on my office computer.  
2. Draft a one‐page “Donor Background Brief” in our fundraising CRM that includes:  
   • Donor’s name, contact info, and stated giving capacity  
   • Employment timeline at the financial group and publicly documented controversies (with dates)  
   • Any press or watchdog‐group citations linking the donor or the company to predatory practices  
3. Submit that Brief, along with a copy of the Gift Acceptance Policy, to our next weekly Gift Acceptance Committee meeting agenda.  
4. Email the committee (chair, general counsel, CFO, VP of Advancement) a DOT form request for a basic third-party background check on the donor—specifically screening for regulatory actions or lawsuits naming the individual.  
5. In my fundraising CRM, tag this donor record with a “Pending Committee Review” status so that no pledge agreements or gift receipts are generated until the committee issues its formal recommendation.
