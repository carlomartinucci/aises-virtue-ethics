I would set up and facilitate a Navajo-centered water-allocation working group that feeds directly into the Colorado River negotiations.  Concrete steps:  

1. Secure funding and charter  
   • Draft a one-page charter defining the group’s mission (“determine the Navajo Nation’s minimum annual water entitlement and infrastructure needs”).  
   • Work with the Bureau of Reclamation and Interior Department to commit $250,000 in technical-assistance funds under existing tribal water grants.  

2. Assemble delegates and experts  
   • Ask the Navajo Nation President’s office to appoint three tribal council delegates and two chapter officials.  
   • Ask Arizona’s state water-resources department to appoint one liaison.  
   • Contract a small hydrology team (2 engineers, 1 financial analyst) to map current Navajo water access and infrastructure gaps.  

3. Schedule the first workshop  
   • Reserve a conference room at the Navajo Nation’s Window Rock council chambers for a two-day meeting within 30 days.  
   • Send formal invitations, agenda, and a one-page data sheet on the Colorado River’s current and projected flows.  

4. Workshop agenda (Day 1)  
   • Morning: Hydrology team presents mapped gaps—number of homes without piped water, gallons/day deficits, cost estimates to extend mains or install satellite systems.  
   • Afternoon: Tribal delegates list priority projects (e.g., connect 500 homes along Highway 264, install two mobile tanker stations).  

5. Workshop agenda (Day 2)  
   • Morning: Public-meeting segment where chapter residents testify (time slots, translated into Diné).  
   • Afternoon: Draft a one-page “Navajo Minimum Entitlement Request” specifying:  
      – Annual volume needed (e.g., 50,000 acre-feet)  
      – Infrastructure plan (cost and timeline for 10 pipeline extensions and 5 solar-powered pump stations)  
      – Commitment to co-manage project oversight with Bureau of Reclamation  

6. Issue and circulate the deliverable  
   • By Day 35, finalize and print 50 copies of the “Navajo Minimum Entitlement Request.”  
   • Send certified copies to: Interior Secretary, the seven state governors’ water-negotiation teams, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner, and the Colorado River Board of California.  

7. Embed the work group into the main negotiations  
   • Propose at the next “7-state plus Mexico” negotiating session that a member of the Navajo working group have a guaranteed seat and speaking slot.  
   • Provide each negotiating state with a one-page summary of Navajo projected needs and planned pipeline/infrastructure timeline.  

By delivering hard data, costed infrastructure plans, and an organized tribal delegation with formal standing in the multi-state talks, this Navajo-centered working group ensures the Nation’s water rights are quantified, visible, and impossible to ignore in the final cutback agreement.
