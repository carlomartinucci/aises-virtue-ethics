I would take these concrete steps:

1. Conduct a focused suicide‐risk assessment now, using a validated tool (for example, the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale).  Ask Julia directly:  
   • “Have you made any plans to kill yourself?”  
   • “Do you have the means right now to carry out a plan?”  
   • “When was the last time you thought about acting on those thoughts?”  

2. If she endorses any plan or intent, invoke the state’s emergency mental-health statutes to place her on an involuntary psychiatric hold (“5150” in California or equivalent in your jurisdiction).  This requires:  
   • Contacting the hospital emergency department to notify them you’re initiating a 72-hour hold for danger to self.  
   • Calling 911 or arranging an immediate ambulance transfer for her to the nearest ED with a psychiatric unit.  

3. During transfer, complete brief safety measures:  
   • Remove all potentially lethal means (her bag, purse, coat).  
   • Sit with her, maintain calm, low-stimulus environment.  
   • Phone ahead so the ED psychiatric team is ready on her arrival.  

4. Document every step in the medical record:  
   • Her expressed thoughts, your questions, her responses.  
   • The legal ground for the involuntary hold.  
   • Who you notified (police/EMS, ED psychiatrist) and when.  

5. Once she’s in ED, notify her personally (not via third party) that because she presented with active suicidal ideation and access to pills, you were legally required to place her on hold.  Tell her you will update her on next steps once the ED team evaluates her.
