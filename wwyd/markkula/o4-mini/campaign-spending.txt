I would take these concrete steps:

1. Immediately cancel the Mercedes-Benz rentals.  
   - Call the rental agency, give them the reservation numbers, and invoke their standard cancellation policy to recoup as much of my deposit as possible.  
   - Document the cancellation via email so I have written proof of the refund request.

2. Redirect that freed‐up budget to a neutral campus shuttle program.  
   - Contact Campus Transit Services today, secure three 15‐passenger vans (they run at cost to student groups).  
   - Book those vans for Election Day shuttle runs between dorms, the student union, and polling sites—open to every voter, regardless of whom they support.  

3. Publicize the change to voters.  
   - Send out a text blast and post on my campaign’s official Instagram and Facebook pages:  
     “UPDATE: Instead of exclusive Mercedes rides, we’re sponsoring free campus shuttle rides for every voter on Election Day. Let’s make sure everyone’s voice is heard!”  
   - Hang two new posters on campus bulletin boards showing a simple shuttle map and times (no candidate branding on the vans themselves).

4. Reallocate any refunded car‐rental money into a joint “Get Out the Vote” effort with Alix.  
   - Email Alix’s team with a $250 check and an invitation: “Let’s combine resources on Election Day shuttle service—so logistics help every student vote, no matter their choice.”  

By canceling the luxury cars, funding neutral campus vans, publicizing the shuttle for all voters, and sharing resources with my opponent, I both remove the unfair advantage and maximize turnout fairly.
