I would stand up a dedicated “MiDAS Claims Review and Remediation Unit” inside the Michigan Department of Treasury and then immediately rerun every 2013–2015 fraud determination through a human‐review process. In practice that means:  
1. Spin up a cross-functional team of 10 case officers (two from UI claims, two from child support, two from tax, two from IT/data-forensics, two from legal) whose sole job for the next six months is to reevaluate every MiDAS fraud flag issued in that period.  
2. Pull the full list of ~40,000 flagged files and assign them in batches of 50 to each case officer, along with all supporting documents (application forms, payment histories, bank‐transaction records).  
3. For each file, the case officer will:  
   a. Compare the algorithm’s fraud rationale (e.g. “multiple IP addresses,” “income discrepancy”) against the claimant’s actual documents.  
   b. Interview the claimant by phone (or in person, where feasible) using a standardized 15-question template to fill in gaps in the record.  
   c. Make a binary fraud/no-fraud determination based on state law and documented evidence, ignoring the computer’s original score.  
4. As each file is closed, instruct finance to reverse any fines, garnishments, or withheld refunds within 10 business days for all cases reclassified as “no fraud.” Issue a one-page statement to the claimant explaining exactly which records changed the decision.  
5. Track progress via a live dashboard showing “Files Reviewed,” “Confirmed Fraud,” “Cleared,” and “Refunds Issued.” Publish weekly totals publicly on the Treasury website.  
6. After 30 days of operation, run a quality-control check by having a second reviewer audit 10% of the “Confirmed Fraud” findings. If the overturn rate in that sample exceeds 10%, pause all garnishments until remediation is complete and notify the governor’s office.  

By launching this unit within two weeks, rerunning every case in six months, and publicly reporting both progress and error rates, we would both remediate past harms and create a blueprint for human-in-the-loop oversight going forward.
