1. At the start of tonight’s meeting, stand, address the chair, and say: “Point of personal privilege—I have a close friendship with Emily, president of the Hawaiian Cultural Club, creating a clear conflict of interest on their funding request. I am recusing myself from the discussion and vote on that item.”  
2. Stay in the room so that your physical presence still counts toward quorum (per our bylaws, members who recuse on an item remain “present” for quorum purposes).  
3. Immediately after recusing, pull out your phone, open the group chat for student senators, and post: “We have quorum if I’m here in the room even though I’m not voting on the Hawaiian Club request. Please join remotely via Zoom if you can’t make it physically—link’s in this chat.”  
4. If any senators respond that they’re too sick to log in, send a follow-up within five minutes: “I’ll share the meeting minutes and recorded discussion on Slack. If you can log in for a voice vote on these funding items, please do so by 8:10 PM so we can proceed tonight.”  
5. When the time for the Hawaiian Club vote arrives, quietly step aside, hand your ballot to the clerk with “ABSTAIN – conflict of interest,” and return to your seat without commenting on the merits of the request.  
6. Once votes are tabulated, resume full participation for the remainder of the agenda.
