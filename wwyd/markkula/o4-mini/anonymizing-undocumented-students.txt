1. Right after the interview, I’d email Anthony (the news editor) a two‐sentence memo: “Adam, who asked to remain unnamed, shared a vivid account of daily deportation‐fear on campus. I recommend we run his quotes under a pseudonym and omit any identifying details.”  
2. I’d call Adam within 24 hours to confirm in writing how he wants to appear. I’d send him a simple release form stating:  
   – “I, Adam [pseudonym to be filled in], consent to the use of my interview quotes with my real name withheld.”  
   – A checkbox for “Use my first name only,” “Use a made‐up name,” or “Do not use any name at all.”  
3. Once Adam checks “Use a made‐up name,” I’d assign him “Miguel” in all story references and ask him to initial that change on the release form.  
4. I’d remove all identifying context: no photo, no building names where he lives or studies, no mention of his specific hometown in El Salvador.  
5. I’d draft the article with his quotes under “Miguel,” and add a 2-sentence editor’s note at the top: “To protect our source from deportation risk, ‘Miguel’ is a pseudonym.”  
6. I’d send that draft to Anthony for approval, emphasizing: “We maintain transparency by explaining our anonymous‐source policy, and Miguel sees it before publication.”  
7. I’d then forward the final draft to Miguel (“Here’s the story with your quotes under ‘Miguel.’ Please confirm by replying ‘OK to publish’ by tomorrow 5 p.m.”).  
8. As soon as I get his OK, I’d file the story for publication. If he withholds approval, I’d strike all direct quotes and rerun the piece focusing on policy details without his testimonial.
