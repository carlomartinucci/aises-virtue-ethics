I would take the following concrete steps:

1. Extract the raw sales data. In our BI tool (e.g. Tableau), I’d build a simple pivot table listing each customer by department, the line-item product (Basic vs. Advanced), and the dollar amount.  
2. Flag every record where a “Basic” product sale was folded into the Advanced total. I’d add a column called “Misclassified?” with a TRUE/FALSE formula.  
3. Create a two-slide deck:  
   • Slide 1: A snapshot of the pivot—showing, for example, Acme Corp. Ops $300K Basic + $200K Finance Advanced vs. the $500K all-Advanced entry in our official report.  
   • Slide 2: A summary count of how many transactions and how much revenue (in dollars) have been misclassified over the last two quarters.  
4. Email that deck to my direct manager (in Finance & Analytics), copying the head of Revenue Operations and the internal Audit mailbox. In the body I’d write:  
   “I’ve noticed these misclassifications in our Advanced vs. Basic sales reporting. I’ve attached a two-slide summary. Can we meet tomorrow at 10 AM to review and correct the mapping rules in our sales feed?”  
5. Block the 10 AM slot on both calendars. In that meeting, I’d walk through the two slides, ask for their view on source-system settings, and propose updating the ETL logic so that Basic items map to the Basic bucket going forward—and back-correct prior quarters if necessary.
