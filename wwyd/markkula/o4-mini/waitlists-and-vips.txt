1. Immediately draft and send a short email to the entire senior class with today’s date in the subject line (“Senior Ball: 5 Extra Tickets Available – First-Come, First-Served Waitlist”), including:  
   • A one-paragraph description of the situation (“We discovered five extra spots. To give everyone a fair shot…”).  
   • A link to a Google Form that asks for each student’s name, student ID, and email.  
   • A clear deadline: “Form closes at noon tomorrow.”  
2. Open a simple Google Form with three fields: “Full Name,” “Student ID,” and “Email Address.” Set it so each student can only submit once.  
3. Enlist one or two fellow student-government members to monitor form submissions while you handle venue checks. Give them edit access to the form’s response spreadsheet.  
4. At noon the next day, export the responses spreadsheet and sort by timestamp to remove any late entries.  
5. Use random.org (or =RANDBETWEEN() in Google Sheets) to assign each remaining entry a random number, then sort by that number to randomize the list.  
6. Select the top five entries and immediately send personalized invitation emails template-filled with their names, event details, and instructions on where and when to pick up their printed tickets.  
7. In that same email, CC your two student-government colleagues so they can assist at check-in and verify that nobody else claims a spot.  
8. Archive the response spreadsheet and your email thread for accountability, then resume your venue setup, confident that you’ve filled the five spots fairly without burdening yourself with hundreds of follow-up messages.
