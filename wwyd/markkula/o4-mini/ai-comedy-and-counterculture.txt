I’m the YouTube content‐policy moderator assigned to reviewing this upload. Here’s exactly what I would do, step by step:

1.  Run the video through our in-house deep‐fake and voice‐imprint detection model.  
   – I’d submit the audio track into our “voice‐clone detector” API endpoint, which compares it against George Carlin’s known recordings.  
   – The model returns a high confidence score (≥ 0.9) that this is an unauthorized Carlin voice clone.

2.  Flag the video for copyright review.  
   – I’d click “Flag for Copyright” in our moderation dashboard, selecting “Unauthenticated celebrity voice impersonation.”  
   – That auto‐notifies our legal team and queues the video for a DMCA/rights‐holder check.

3.  Send an immediate notice to the uploader.  
   – Using our templated “Notice of Potential Infringement,” I’d inform them:  
     • “We have detected what appears to be an unauthorized AI‐generated impersonation of George Carlin. Please provide proof of express permission from the Carlin estate within 48 hours or face takedown.”

4.  Notify the Carlin estate’s representative.  
   – I’d look up their designated DMCA agent contact from the U.S. Copyright Office index, then forward them our detection report and flagged-video link with a “platform action pending” alert.

5.  Place the video into “uploads on hold.”  
   – While the 48-hour window runs, I’d change its status to “private” so no new views accumulate.  
   – A record of the view-count freeze appears on the dashboard.

6.  If no valid permission appears in 48 hours: issue a formal takedown.  
   – I’d select “Takedown” in the dashboard, choosing “unauthorized celebrity voice clone.”  
   – YouTube’s system automatically emails the uploader a takedown notice and initiates a three-strike process.

7.  Update policy guidance.  
   – I’d add a new clause under “Deepfakes & Voice Cloning” stating: “Any AI‐generated impersonation of a deceased or living public figure requires documented, verifiable rights‐holder consent before public upload.”  
   – I’d notify the policy‐update mailing list to ensure all moderators apply the new rule.

By following those concrete steps—automatic detection, user notice, rights-holder notification, takedown, and policy update—I’d ensure we remove the Carlin impersonation quickly and prevent further uploads.
