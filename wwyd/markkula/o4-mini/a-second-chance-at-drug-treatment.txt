1. Re-admit Jerome to the outpatient dosing line first thing this morning.  I will override the “one-chance” flag on his record and personally sign the paper form that authorizes his daily methadone dose so he doesn’t miss another day of medication.  
2. While he’s waiting for his dose, I’ll escort Jerome back into the private counseling office for a 30-minute “crisis re-engagement” session.  In that session I will:  
   a. Update his clinical risk assessment (suicide, overdose, housing needs).  
   b. Re-set a brief safety plan (who he calls if he feels like using, remind him to carry his take-home naloxone).  
   c. Confirm his availability for an extra two one-to-one counseling slots this week (I block out 45 minutes each on Wednesday and Friday afternoon).  
3. Immediately after that session, I will:  
   a. Email and then call the intake coordinator at the nearest inpatient facility (River Valley Addiction Center) to request an emergency provisional bed for Jerome, citing his recent overdose and my updated clinical report.  I will ask for their next cancellation list date and put Jerome’s name at the top.  
   b. Submit an internal “exception funding request” through our program’s Medicaid-supplement grant to cover any out-of-network costs or transportation vouchers to get him to River Valley when a bed opens.  
4. I will personally draft a one-page “clinical appeal” to Jerome’s insurance company, attaching:  
   – His history of prescription-to-street opioid transition  
   – The recent overdose ER record  
   – My latest ASAM assessment showing that outpatient alone is now insufficient  
   I will fax and follow up by phone within two hours.  
5. Back at our center, I’ll assign Jerome a volunteer peer mentor, Marcus (an African-American former program graduate), and schedule their first meeting for tomorrow at noon.  I’ll also give Jerome an unlimited-use bus pass to ensure he can attend every dose and group.  
6. Finally, I’ll notify my supervisor and the program director by 5 pm today: “I’ve made clinical exceptions to readmit Jerome, initiated an inpatient emergency referral, and put supports in place while we await that bed.  Please let me know if you need additional documentation or a team review.”  
7. I will document every step in Jerome’s EHR immediately after each call/meeting so there is an auditable trail of why and how we made an exception for him.
