1. At the start of our next session, I’d pull up his most recent RPR and TP-PA lab reports on the clinic computer, hit Print, and hand him the paper copies.2. I’d sit next to him at a small table, place the printouts in front of him, and walk through each line: “Here’s last week’s RPR: nonreactive. Here’s the confirmatory TP-PA: negative. Both labs ran on June 5th at LabCorp.”3. When he asks how labs work, I’d grab a simple one-page diagram of the syphilis testing algorithm (screening test → confirmatory test) and trace each arrow with my finger, pointing out that two consecutive negatives make active syphilis extremely unlikely.4. I’d then say, “Because I know this belief feels urgent to you, I’ve just called the lab courier. You can come down this afternoon for a repeat RPR draw—no copay, no paperwork—so we can both be absolutely sure.” I’d give him a clinic slip with today’s date and time stamped.5. Finally, I’d transition back to his psychiatric care: “Once that draw is done, let’s talk about how you’ve been sleeping and see if we can adjust your Seroquel dose by five milligrams. I want you stable enough to drop into the lab without extra stress.” And I’d book that phlebotomy slot on the schedule, send him a text reminder, and document the entire conversation in his chart.
