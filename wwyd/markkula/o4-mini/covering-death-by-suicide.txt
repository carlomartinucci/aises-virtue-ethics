1. Contact the student’s family to request their blessing and any biographical details they’re comfortable sharing.  
2. Schedule a 15-minute phone call or in-person meeting with the family to confirm the timeline of his campus involvement and ask for two or three favorite memories or achievements.  
3. Email the campus counseling center director asking to interview her for ten minutes about what campus mental health services exist, how students can access them, and any upcoming programs.  
4. Draft the obituary focusing on:  
   • His roles in student government, environmental justice projects, and interfaith events  
   • Personal anecdotes provided by the family and two friends in student government  
   • What he taught peers about leadership and collaboration  
5. Write a sidebar head-lined “Getting Help on Campus” that lists:  
   • 24/7 campus counseling crisis line and hours  
   • Local and national suicide-prevention hotlines  
   • Dates and times of next student mental-health workshops  
6. Follow the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention’s reporting checklist:  
   • Omit method details of his death  
   • Include a brief sentence acknowledging his struggle with depression, as confirmed by the family  
   • Avoid sensational language (“tragic,” “suicide epidemic,” etc.)  
7. Send the full draft to the counseling center director for a two-hour review to ensure no graphic or triggering material remains.  
8. Share the approved draft with the editor-in-chief for a final editorial pass focusing on tone and placement (e.g., front page of the campus life section).  
9. Publish the obituary and sidebar together, and simultaneously post a link on the student news social-media channels.  
10. Within one week of publication, organize a moderated campus forum in partnership with the counseling center, promoting it at the end of the obituary (“Join us…”).
