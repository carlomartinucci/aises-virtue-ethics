I would draft and roll out a “Board Member Commitment Agreement” and require every one of the 20 board members to sign it by a firm deadline. Here’s exactly what I’d do:

1. Within 48 hours, draft a two-page Commitment Agreement that spells out:  
   • Attendance requirement (minimum 75% of meetings and retreats per calendar year)  
   • Fundraising expectation (e.g. a $5,000 personal gift or fundraising equivalent)  
   • Committee engagement (signing up for at least one standing committee)  
   • Consequence for non-compliance (formal review by the Governance Committee)

2. Email that Agreement to all 20 board members with a clear subject line (“Please sign by June 15: 2024 Board Member Commitment Agreement”), attach a pre-addressed return envelope and a DocuSign link.

3. In the body of the email, call out exactly what you need them to do:  
   a. Review the Agreement.  
   b. Sign and return by June 15 via DocuSign or hard copy.  
   c. Indicate in the DocuSign form which committee they’ll join.

4. Within 24 hours of sending, schedule 15-minute follow-up calls with every board member who hasn’t signed by June 10. Use a shared calendar invite to lock in those calls.

5. After the June 15 deadline, report—by name—who has and hasn’t complied at the next board meeting’s Governance Committee report. For anyone still unsigned, the Governance Committee will meet and vote on either placing them on probation or submitting their seat for replacement.

That sequence puts clear, concrete expectations in front of each board member and creates measurable accountability.
