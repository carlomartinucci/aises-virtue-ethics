1. At the top of the “Joshua disciplinary” item, say: “I move that we enter an executive (closed-door) session for this item only. Only voting executive-branch members and our adviser will remain.”  
2. Put the motion to a quick voice vote. If it carries (simple majority of those present), say: “Thank you. This portion of the meeting is now closed to the public. Senator X, could you please wait in the lobby until we finish?”  
3. If the senator refuses, stand, approach him calmly, hand him a printed copy of the motion, and say, “The board just voted to discuss this matter in a private executive session. I’m enforcing our board’s decision. Please step out now.”  
4. Once he leaves, lock or close the door, note in the minutes that the public was cleared, and proceed with the discussion.  
5. After you reach a decision on Joshua, reconvene the open session, announce the outcome (“By a vote of 6–2 we’ve decided to suspend Joshua’s voting privileges for two weeks pending sensitivity training”), and thank everyone for returning.  
6. Finally, on your next public docket, introduce a specific bylaw amendment granting the president power to call closed sessions on personnel or disciplinary matters, and schedule it for first reading so future meetings aren’t left to improvised procedure.
