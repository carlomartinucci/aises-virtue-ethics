1. Locate and review the institution’s written gift‐acceptance and conflict‐of‐interest policy (filed under “Staff Handbook,” section 4.2). 2. Email a copy of that policy to your direct supervisor (the owners) with a one-sentence note: “Please confirm whether I may accept these tickets or if I need to decline, per policy.” 3. In the same email, attach a short bullet summary of today’s meeting with Judith’s parents, including:  
   • Their request for Hannah in a group-learning slot  
   • Your explanation of private-learning costs versus group assignments  
   • Their offer of two event tickets  
4. While waiting for their reply (set a reminder to follow up in 48 hours), draft a parent‐letter templates:  
   – Option A (if tickets must be declined): Thank them for their trust, politely decline the gift “so as to remain consistent with our institution’s policies,” and restate how they can secure Hannah via the private package.  
   – Option B (if tickets may be accepted): Acknowledge receipt of the tickets, thank them, and confirm that Judith remains in the randomized group-learning schedule.  
5. Do not change Judith’s instructor assignment. Keep her in the next available randomized slot. 6. Once you receive the owners’ decision, send the appropriate letter template to the parents within 24 hours. 7. Independently of gift acceptance, schedule a 30-minute “learning-plan” session for Judith during existing group hours: prepare a customized worksheet or reading list so Judith receives a small boost without altering her instructor or program tier. 8. Log the entire incident and your correspondence in the institution’s compliance folder (shared drive path “/Governance/Gifts‐and‐Grants/2024/”).
