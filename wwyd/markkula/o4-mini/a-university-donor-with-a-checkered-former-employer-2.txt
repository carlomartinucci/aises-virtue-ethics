I would draft and submit a brief to our Gift Acceptance Committee by the end of the day. In that memo I would:  
1. Summarize the donor’s employment dates at the financial group and note that they retired before 2008.  
2. Attach publicly available press clippings about the 2008 predatory‐lending scandal.  
3. Highlight any existing university gift‐acceptance policies on reputational risk.  
4. Recommend next steps—either approving the gift with standard thank‐you language, approving with a “use restrictions” clause (for scholarships or programs benefiting single mothers), or politely declining if the committee feels reputational risk outweighs benefit.  

I would then schedule a slot on tomorrow morning’s Committee agenda to discuss and decide.
