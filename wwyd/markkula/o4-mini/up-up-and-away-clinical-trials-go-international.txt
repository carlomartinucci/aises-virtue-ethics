I would negotiate and implement an “early‐access and transition care” program for those Russian trial volunteers, with these concrete steps:  
1. Draft a proposal for Rx’s executive team and legal department to reserve a fixed allocation of the new arthritis drug—enough for all 310 trial participants—for an additional 12 months at no cost or deeply subsidized cost.  
2. Secure a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with at least one Russian regional clinic network or NGO (for example, the Local Arthritis Relief Foundation in Moscow Oblast) to:  
   • Distribute the reserved drug supply directly to trial enrollees.  
   • Provide routine follow-up appointments (every 8 weeks) for monitoring and basic supportive care (lab tests, pain management counseling).  
3. Work with Rx’s supply chain team to:  
   • Manufacture and ship the designated drug allotment under “compassionate use” labeling to the partner clinic.  
   • Track inventory closely via batch numbers to ensure continuity.  
4. Develop and translate into Russian a simple “continuation package” that includes:  
   • A two-page summary of why patients benefitted and how to take the drug safely.  
   • Contact information for the partner clinics and a 24-hour hotline staffed by a bilingual nurse.  
5. Launch an enrollment drive by sending former trial patients postcards and making follow-up calls—using phone numbers collected during the trial—inviting them to register for the transition program at no charge.  
6. Monitor adherence and adverse events by requiring partner clinics to submit monthly case reports back to Rx’s safety team, so we can track outcomes and adjust the program as needed.  
By doing this, we ensure the people who carried risk in our trial don’t lose access overnight and can continue benefiting from the medication while we scale up global supply.
