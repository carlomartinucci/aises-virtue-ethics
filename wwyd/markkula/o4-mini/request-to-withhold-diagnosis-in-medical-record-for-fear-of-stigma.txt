1. Schedule Sophie for a full initial psychiatric‐medicine visit in my own clinic tomorrow morning and reserve a 45-minute slot so I can do a thorough assessment.  
2. At that visit, complete a standardized depression inventory (e.g. PHQ-9) and document in the chart her history of two prior depressive episodes, the menstrual-related treatment coding she requested, and her current symptoms (sadness, anhedonia, appetite loss, lethargy).  
3. Based on her moderate to severe score, write a prescription for sertraline 50 mg daily, titrating up to 100 mg in two weeks if tolerated. Enter into her chart under the diagnosis “Major Depressive Episode, recurrent, moderate.”  
4. Arrange a referral to Dr. Patel, a licensed clinical psychologist in private practice who bills “self-pay only” and does not submit claims to insurance. In the referral note I’ll list “outpatient psychotherapy for depressive symptoms” so billing is transparently tied to depression.  
5. Inform Sophie that I will not alter or omit diagnostic details in her medical record; explain that any off-the-record notes would violate Medical School clinic policy and state medical record statutes.  
6. Offer to coordinate with our student health office to see if Sophie qualifies for confidential counseling under the school’s physician-health program, which does not report to licensing boards. Provide her the application form before she leaves.  
7. Schedule a follow-up in four weeks to reassess her response to the SSRI, monitor side effects, and review her progress in therapy.  
8. Copy all documentation into our secure electronic chart immediately after the visit so there is no gap or unrecorded “shadow” chart.
