1. Contact both schools’ administrators this week and propose a 90-day hybrid schedule for Kyle:  
   a. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, Kyle attends Eminent Scholars from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM for one-to-one instruction in math, reading and science.  
   b. Tuesdays and Thursdays, he attends the local public elementary school from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM in a self-contained special-needs classroom that groups him with three other students.  

2. Draft and share with both schools a detailed weekly timetable that:  
   – Respects Kyle’s sleep pattern by starting no earlier than 10:00 AM.  
   – Allocates 45-minute blocks at Eminent Scholars for core academics at Kyle’s accelerated pace.  
   – Reserves two 30-minute “social labs” on Tuesdays and Thursdays at the public school, where Kyle practices turn-taking board games and group reading with peers.  

3. Hire a board-certified behavior analyst (BCBA) who:  
   – Comes to both campuses every Wednesday afternoon for a 60-minute social-skills session with Kyle and three classmates.  
   – Creates a visual “social story” and video modeling library showing appropriate eye contact and conversational turns.  

4. Set up a shared online portal by next Friday that:  
   – Gives Kyle’s parents daily access to lesson summaries, sleep-log updates and social-lab attendance.  
   – Allows both schools and the BCBA to update behavior goals and track progress in real time.  

5. At the end of the 90-day trial:  
   – Hold a joint meeting with parents, the public school special-ed coordinator, Eminent Scholars’ director and the BCBA.  
   – Review attendance records, academic progress reports and social-lab observations.  
   – Decide whether to continue the hybrid plan, adjust the balance of one-to-one vs. group time, or explore alternative placements.
