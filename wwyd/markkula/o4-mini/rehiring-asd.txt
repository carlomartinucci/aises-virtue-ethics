I would open a formal interactive‐process file under the ADA and proceed as follows:  
1. Send Matt a written notice acknowledging receipt of his ASD disclosure and reinstatement request.  
2. Ask him to provide up-to-date medical documentation of his ASD diagnosis (e.g., a note from his treating clinician).  
3. Schedule a 1-hour interactive‐process meeting (via Teams or in person) with Matt, HR, and our EEO officer to discuss:  
   • How his ASD affects his job duties and workplace interactions  
   • Whether the harassment incident was related to an unmet support need or misunderstanding  
   • What reasonable accommodations (coaching, communication aids, mandatory peer-mentor check-ins) might prevent future policy breaches  
4. While that meeting is pending, place Matt’s reinstatement request on hold but keep him informed of timelines (e.g., “We will meet by 5/15 and aim to reach a determination by 5/22”).  
5. After the meeting, draft a written determination that either:  
   a) Offers reinstatement under specified accommodations (e.g., mandatory weekly supervisor check-ins for three months, completion of a tailored workplace-behavior coaching program) and a probationary period, or  
   b) Denies reinstatement if his offense cannot be reasonably accommodated given its severity.  
6. Send that determination to Matt, copy his manager and HR file, and, if offering reinstatement, prepare a return-to‐work plan outlining training dates, accommodation start dates, and probationary review points.
