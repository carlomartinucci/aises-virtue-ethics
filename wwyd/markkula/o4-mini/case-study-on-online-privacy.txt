I would launch a two‐week “reality check” audit of the social-media tool by doing the following concrete steps:

1. Assemble a small review panel:
   • One licensed school counselor  
   • Two teachers (one from middle school, one from high school)  
   • Two student representatives (with parent permission)  

2. Pull every post the vendor flagged in the past 30 days (anonymized for privacy).  

3. Over 10 working days, have the panel read and classify each flagged post into one of three buckets:
   A. Genuine concern (threat of violence or self-harm)  
   B. Harmless joke, satire or out-of-context quote  
   C. Other (e.g. profanity, off-topic drama)  

4. Log results in a simple spreadsheet:
   • Post ID  
   • Panel classification (A, B or C)  
   • Short note on why (e.g. “quoted movie line,” “clear threat to ‘blow up’ cafeteria”)  

5. At the end of two weeks, calculate:
   • True-positive rate = #A ÷ total flagged  
   • False-positive rate = #B+#C ÷ total flagged  

6. Present the spreadsheet and summary statistics to the superintendent and school board with a recommendation:
   – If false positives exceed 50%, pause the automated alerts until vendor improves accuracy  
   – If true positives are under 20%, renegotiate tool thresholds or drop the service  

7. Share the panel’s executive summary (no names, just stats and example quotes) with parents via email and post on the district website.  

By doing this audit, I’ll know exactly how many alerts are spurious, force the vendor to refine its algorithm, and give parents and students concrete data rather than vague assurances.
