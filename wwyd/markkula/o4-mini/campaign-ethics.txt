I would take the following concrete steps:

1. Restore the Community Relations events to their original, fall‐semester dates.  
   – Open the ASI Branch Events spreadsheet, revert each delayed event’s date cell back to the autumn slot.  
   – Send a calendar update to Facilities & Student Life reserving the original rooms and time slots.  

2. Notify my supervisor and the ASI advisor in writing that I’ve realized my dual role could appear to give me an unfair advantage in the election.  
   – Draft and send an email to the ASI Executive Director and the Advisor on ASI policy, stating: “I’ve adjusted our event schedule back to its original timing to remove any overlap with the upcoming campaign season. Please let me know if you see any further conflicts of interest.”  

3. Segregate my campaign planning from my Community Relations work.  
   – Create a separate “Campaign Ideas” document in my personal folder (not on the shared ASI drive).  
   – Stop using ASI office hours or ASI resources (printing, meeting rooms, staff time) for any campaign‐related activity until the official campaign period opens.  

4. Confirm completion of these steps.  
   – After I’ve sent the email and restored the dates, I’ll print the updated events calendar and initial each line item by hand, then file it in our Branch binder. That way there’s a clear, auditable record that the fall dates are back in place and no events are being held to influence the spring election.
