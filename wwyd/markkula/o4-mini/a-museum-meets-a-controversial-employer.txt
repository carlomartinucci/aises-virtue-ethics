1. I would immediately flag this pledge to our Gift Acceptance Committee and ask the Executive Assistant to schedule an emergency meeting within the next three business days.  
2. I’d assemble a one-page briefing packet for that meeting, including:  
   • A printout of the donor’s offer email (with dates and amounts)  
   • Screenshots of the news articles alleging child-labor and wage-theft by the donor’s family  
   • A one-paragraph summary of our museum’s Gift Acceptance Policy (the section on reputational risk)  
3. I’d send that packet to all committee members—Development Director, CFO, General Counsel, Board Governance Chair—so they have 48 hours to review before we meet.  
4. In parallel, I would ask our General Counsel to draft a short follow-up questionnaire to the donor, to be sent only if and after the committee votes to “provisionally accept” the gift. That questionnaire would request:  
   • A description of the legal entity through which the funds will flow (e.g. family trust, LLC, personal account)  
   • Representation that the donor’s source of funds is not connected to any ongoing litigation or labor-rights investigations  
   • A statement of indemnification in case any future investigation ties the museum to those allegations  
5. Finally, I would instruct the CFO to set the $X pledge aside but not deposit it into our operating account until the committee completes its due-diligence review and either:  
   a. Votes to accept the gift unconditionally, or  
   b. Votes to accept it under conditions (e.g., delay until the family’s case is resolved), or  
   c. Votes to politely decline if the reputational risk is deemed too high.
