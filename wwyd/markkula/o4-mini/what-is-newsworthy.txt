I would launch a single follow-up Twitter poll tied to that viral freezer tweet to collect hard data before deciding whether to keep pushing campus safety reports. Specifically:  
1. Draft a two-option poll tweet replying to the original post:  
   • Option A: “Keep these quick safety report tweets coming.”  
   • Option B: “Only tweet major incidents—skip minor/freezer-type stories.”  
2. Publish the poll 24 hours after the original tweet (to catch the same audience while they’re still engaged).  
3. Let the poll run for 48 hours.  
4. Export the poll results and engagement metrics (votes, comments, link clicks) via Twitter Analytics.  
5. Present those numbers—percent agreement, total reach, comparative CTR on any links—to the newspaper’s editorial meeting.  

Based on the clear numeric split from the poll and accompanying click-through data, decide concretely whether to keep daily “safety report” tweets, curtail them to only high-impact incidents, or retire the segment altogether.
