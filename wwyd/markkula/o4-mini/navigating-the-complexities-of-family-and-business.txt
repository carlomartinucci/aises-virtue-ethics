1. Commission a formal, written cash-flow and market‐rent analysis by a commercial real estate advisor.  • Contact three local firms (e.g. CBRE, Cushman & Wakefield, JLL) this week and ask each for a 10-page report on likely rental rates, vacancy forecasts, management fees, and net operating income if the building is re-tenanted within six months.  • Set a one-month deadline for delivery of these reports.  
2. Prepare a two-page board memo summarizing those three proposals plus a 12-month profit‐and‐loss projection under each scenario:  
   – “Do nothing” (zero tenants; $0 income)  
   – “Hire external management” (projected rents at 75% occupancy within six months)  
   – “Sell building” (net proceeds after commissions, closing costs, taxes, and a 25% minority discount).  
3. Circulate the memo and the three advisor reports to Donald, Sally, the cousins, and an independent corporate attorney at least ten days before the next board meeting. Include an agenda item titled “Vote on management vs. sale.”  
4. At the board meeting:  
   a. Present the cash‐flow analysis side by side with the exit valuation.  
   b. Show that, under the management proposal, each 25% shareholder would receive approximately $60,000 per year in net distributions once tenants are secured—compared to a one-time after-tax payout of roughly $500,000 if the building is sold at depressed market value.  
   c. Propose a binding motion: “Authorize CFO Mary to engage [chosen management firm] under a six-month trial contract, with a performance clause that if occupancy does not reach 60% by month six, then the board reconvenes within 30 days to consider sale.”  
5. Call the vote on that exact motion.  
6. If the motion passes (51% or more):  
   – Instruct Mary’s office to draft and sign the management agreement immediately.  
   – Task Donald’s office with approving the first quarter’s budget for marketing and tenant improvements.  
7. If the motion fails (meaning Donald and one other vote for sale):  
   – Invoke the same board resolution to commission an independent valuation for a minority‐discount buyout, capped at 70% of full‐value pro-rata share.  
   – Present that single figure to Donald as a take-it-or-leave-it offer, to be paid out over five years with interest, rather than forcing an immediate full‐value sale.  
   – If Donald rejects this offer within 30 days, prepare to list the building for sale under corporate bylaws, with clear instructions to the property broker to seek at least three offers and report back to the board for final approval.  
8. Whichever path unfolds, document every step in the board minutes and circulating email so that family relationships remain intact by keeping decision-making transparent, fact‐based, and strictly tied to the numbers in the cash-flow and valuation reports.
