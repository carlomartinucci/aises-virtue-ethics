I would embed PunkSpider’s data feed straight into my team’s ticketing and firewall workflow. Here’s exactly what I’d do:

1. Subscribe to the PunkSpider API or RSS feed and filter for any entries matching our domains.  
2. Write a small Python script (deployed on our internal DevOps server) that runs every hour to pull new vulnerability records for “mycompany.com” and “api.mycompany.com.”  
3. Parse each record to extract:  
   • URL path  
   • Vulnerability type (e.g. XSS, SQLi)  
   • Severity rating  
4. For every new record, automatically open a JIRA ticket in our “WebApp Security” project with:  
   • Summary: “[PunkSpider] <vuln-type> at <URL path>”  
   • Description: the exploit steps verbatim from PunkSpider plus a link to the full entry  
   • Priority: map PunkSpider severity to JIRA priority (e.g. “Critical” → P1)  
   • Assignee: the on-call “WebApp Security” engineer  
5. Post a Slack notification to the #web-sec channel tagging @sec-oncall with ticket link and “Please triage & patch within 24h.”  
6. Meanwhile, update our NGINX configuration to block PunkSpider’s UA string (“PunkSpiderScanner/2.0”) by adding a rule in nginx.conf:  
   if ($http_user_agent ~* “PunkSpiderScanner”) { return 403; }  
7. Add a meta‐tag and robots.txt entry to discourage indexing—while knowing it’s not foolproof:  
   • <meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow">  
   • robots.txt: “User-agent: PunkSpiderScanner Disallow: /”  
8. Track each JIRA ticket’s progress on our weekly security dashboard, and escalate any ticket older than 48 hours to the CISO if not resolved.  

This way, every PunkSpider hit against our assets automatically turns into a prioritized, SLA-tracked remediation task, and we immediately deny their scanner at the web server level.
