I’d spin up a private test session of the “exotic” package and walk through every step of the user journey myself, logging technical and experiential issues as I go. Concretely, I’d:  
1. Sign up under a throw-away test account.  
2. Select the “exotic” package and book a one-week itinerary.  
3. Meet my smartraVeleR consultant avatar, then in a spreadsheet record:  
   • How long the booking screen takes to load at each click (aim: <1 second).  
   • Whether I can adjust weather, NPC friendliness, crowd density—and if any slider hits a dead end.  
   • Any visual glitches (tearing, frame-drops) or audio dropouts during the live demo.  
4. Move through each “day” of the mock vacation:  
   • Enter a market scenario, attempt five haggles with the NPC merchant, and note if the haggling AI ever repeats the same phrase.  
   • Visit the “VIP dance party” in the Great Pyramid, crowd-count the avatars (target 50), and verify my celebrity guest appears in the proper spot.  
5. At the end of the session, compile a prioritized bug list (load times over 1 s, missing NPC actions, audio/video glitches) and send it to engineering with screenshots, timestamps, and console logs.
