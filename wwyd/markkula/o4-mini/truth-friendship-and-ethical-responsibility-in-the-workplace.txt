1. Pull all of Michael’s “pending” orders into a single spreadsheet, with columns for Order ID, Booking Date, Commission Paid Date, Delivery Date (original vs. most-recent rescheduled), and Amount paid to Michael.  
2. In a secure folder on the company network (so there’s an audit trail), save:  
   • Copies of the accounting entries showing commission payouts for those orders  
   • E-mail chains or CRM notes where delivery dates were repeatedly pushed  
   • Any scanned memos or PDFs of Michael’s split-commission agreement with the external firm  
3. Send an e-mail to the Head of Compliance (using your corporate e-mail account, flagged “High Importance”) that says:  
   “I’ve uncovered possible commission fraud in Michael X’s former territory. I’ve attached a spreadsheet and supporting docs. Please confirm receipt and next steps.”  
4. Attach the spreadsheet and at least one representative PDF for context.  
5. Request in that same e-mail: “I’d like to invoke our Whistleblower Protection policy—please confirm that my identity and these materials will be handled under that protocol.”  
6. After sending, log into the compliance portal (or ticketing system) to verify the report was entered under your name, and print a screenshot or save a PDF of the ticket confirmation.  
7. Keep all source documents and your confirmation of report receipt in a personal folder (encrypted if your company allows) so you can demonstrate you acted in good faith and followed company procedure.
