I’d pick one concrete action and run with it: redesign the texter consent flow so that secondary uses of data (training, research, for-profit spin-outs) require an explicit, plain-language opt-in separate from “just getting help.”  

Steps:  
1. Draft a two-step SMS flow:  
   a. “We’re Crisis Text Line. To get started, reply HELP.”  
   b. As soon as someone replies HELP, send:  
      “To provide support, we collect the messages you send today.  We also sometimes use anonymized conversations to train counselors and improve software.  If you’re OK with that, reply Y; if you’d rather we only use your messages to help you right now, reply N.”  

2. Wire that into our messaging platform so that anyone texting HELP for the first time sees the above and can’t proceed until they choose Y or N.  Store that choice on the front end of the conversation.  

3. For folks who reply N, flag their transcripts so they never flow into data-science pipelines or Loris.ai experiments.  For folks who reply Y, route as we do today.  

4. Run an A/B test over one month to measure opt-in rates, retention of texters, volunteer outcomes, and the impact on our counselor-training models.  

5. After 30 days, pull the metrics:  
   • % of new texters who opt in  
   • % who opt out  
   • Difference in counselor confidence scores when trained with datasets that exclude opt-out conversations  
   • Any change in average response time or escalation rates  

6. Use those results to refine:  
   • The exact wording of the opt-in question (simplify further if opt-in is too low)  
   • The placement (e.g. after a first greeting rather than immediately)  
   • Whether we need a brief “why this matters” bullet  

Deliverables in 90 days: a working two-step opt-in flow in production, analysis report on pilot metrics, and a recommendation to adopt, tweak or roll back.
