I would build and integrate an automated, frame-by-frame moderation pipeline that flags and quarantines illegal or abusive content before it ever drops off the server. Here’s exactly how:

1. Infrastructure setup  
   a. Spin up a dedicated “pre-processing” S3 bucket (or equivalent blob store) to temporarily hold incoming 360° uploads.  
   b. Behind that bucket, configure an AWS Lambda (or GCP Cloud Function) trigger for every new upload.

2. Frame extraction  
   a. In the Lambda function, use FFmpeg to extract one equirectangular frame per second from the video.  
   b. Convert each frame to a standard JPEG at 640×320 resolution to limit processing time.

3. Machine-vision scanning  
   a. For each extracted frame, call a hosted moderation API (for example Google Cloud Vision SafeSearch or AWS Rekognition).  
   b. Collect the SafeSearch categories (“adult,” “violence,” “racy,” etc.) plus confidence scores.

4. Flagging rules  
   a. If any frame returns “VERY_LIKELY” or “LIKELY” for “adult” or “violence,” mark the entire video as “quarantine.”  
   b. Store the original upload in an “under-review” bucket and tag it in your database with status=“pending-review.”

5. Human review workflow  
   a. Push a review task into your internal queueing system (e.g. Jira Service Management or Zendesk) with a link to the quarantined file.  
   b. Assign it to a dedicated Trust & Safety reviewer to watch the clip in full VR preview mode.  
   c. Reviewer either releases it for normal delivery or rejects it for violating terms.

6. User notification  
   a. If the clip is cleared, automatically move it from the “under-review” bucket to the normal transient storage bucket, where it will follow the 24-hour deletion policy.  
   b. If the clip is rejected, send an in-app push notification:  
      • “Your recent VR moment could not be shared because it violates our content policy. Please edit or remove prohibited content.”  
   c. Don’t delete the upload immediately—hold it in quarantine for 7 days so the user can appeal via support.

7. Monitoring and metrics  
   a. On launch, build a Grafana dashboard tracking:  
      • Number of uploads scanned per hour  
      • Quarantine rate (%)  
      • Average human-review turnaround time  
   b. Schedule a weekly report to the product/security team to ensure the process remains under 2-hour review.

By slotting this five-stage pipeline into the existing upload flow, URVR can maintain its 24-hour retention promise while ensuring no unlawful or abusive content ever reaches recipients.
