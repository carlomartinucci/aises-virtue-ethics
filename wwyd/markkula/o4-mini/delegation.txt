1. This afternoon, send a calendar‐invite to your three staff for a one‐hour “Task Audit” meeting. On the agenda, have each person list every duty you’ve delegated to them, plus how many hours per week each takes.  
2. During that meeting, identify the two lowest‐impact tasks each staffer is doing (for example, “printing and hand‐folding the neighborhood newsletter” or “tracking down last term’s state budget numbers”). Agree to drop or reassign those six tasks in order to free up each person’s time.  
3. Immediately after the audit, draft a one‐page “Newsletter Automation SOP” that:  
   • Specifies the newsletter template (pulling in student stories via a shared Google Doc),  
   • Automates mailing via your campus email system’s “mail merge” feature,  
   • Assigns the ongoing job of populating that Google Doc to one dedicated “newsletter coordinator” (one of the three assistants).  
4. Post a one‐week job announcement on Handshake and campus bulletin boards for a 5–10 hr/week “State Advocacy Intern.” In the posting, list exactly three responsibilities (e.g., “draft weekly one‐page legislative briefs,” “schedule and accompany you to two meetings per month with state legislators,” “maintain your state‐funding contact list in Airtable”).  
5. Block out 2 hours every Monday morning on your own calendar, labeled “State Advocacy—No Community Meetings,” and treat it as a hard boundary. During that time you will:  
   a. Review your intern’s legislative brief for the week,  
   b. Make two quick follow‐up calls or emails to key legislators or their staff,  
   c. Update your one‐page “State Funding Tracker” spreadsheet.  
6. Schedule a 30-minute check-in every Wednesday at 4 pm with your new intern plus whichever assistant oversees state issues. In that meeting you will:  
   a. Confirm progress on funding requests,  
   b. Flag any obstacles or missing data,  
   c. Reassign tasks as needed to keep your Monday block free.  

By running the Task Audit, automating low-value chores, hiring a dedicated intern, and carving out a protected 2 hr/week for state advocacy, you’ll balance neighborhood relations without overloading your staff or neglecting critical state‐level duties.
