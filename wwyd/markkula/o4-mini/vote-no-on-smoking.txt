1. Draft a compromise resolution instead of an outright ban. In concrete terms, I would write up a one‐page amendment that:  
   • Defines “smoke-free zones” as all building entrances, dining areas, and residence‐hall lobbies plus a 25-foot buffer;  
   • Allows smoking in clearly marked “outdoor smoking areas” at least 50 feet from any building;  
   • Mandates placement of at least five ash-receptacle stations across campus;  
   • Requests a six-month pilot with a mid‐term review on campus air-quality and student feedback.  

2. Circulate that draft to key stakeholders before the next Senate meeting:  
   • Email it by Friday to my sophomore listserv with a one-paragraph description of each bullet;  
   • Post it on the Student Government website under “Proposed Smoking Policy”;  
   • Hand out five hard copies at the sophomore dorm common rooms and ask residents to annotate concerns in the margins.  

3. Host a one-hour public forum next Tuesday at 7 pm in the Student Union meeting room:  
   • Publicize via flyers at dining halls and social-media posts targeted to campus smokers and non‐smokers;  
   • Invite the campus legal counsel and the head of Environmental Health & Safety to give five‐minute overviews of liability and air-quality data;  
   • Assign two volunteers to take written comment cards so we have a text record of every question or objection.  

4. After the forum, consolidate all annotations, comment-card feedback, and legal input into a two-page “Report on Smoking Policy Trade-Offs.” Distribute that report to every senator at least 48 hours before the next vote.  

5. At the following Senate meeting:  
   • Introduce the compromise resolution as “Senate Bill 23-05A”;  
   • Move that we vote on it immediately after a five-minute discussion;  
   • If it passes, work with the administration’s legal office to finalize signage and ash-station contracts—target launch in six weeks.  

By drafting a middle path, soliciting detailed feedback in writing, and building in a pilot review period, I both respect my constituents’ health concerns and address the administration’s legal worries—while avoiding a binary “yes/no” that would isolate the smokers whose voices are often drowned out.
