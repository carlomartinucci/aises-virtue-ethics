I would implement a “redacted‐with‐transparency” workflow in our digital archive.  Step by step I would:  
1. Pull the 1981 article out of our live web archive.  
2. Replace every instance of “Marcus [LastName]” with “[Name Redacted—per subject request]” in the body copy and headline.  
3. At the bottom of the page, append a single line in italics: “Editor’s note: Subject’s name has been redacted at his request. The original print edition remains in our physical archives.”  
4. Update the page’s metadata so that search engines still index the article under its original title (“Fraternity Student Steals Campus Safety Car”), but not under “Marcus [LastName].”  
5. Log the change in our editorial database, tagging the record with date, editor initials, and reason (“digital reputation request”).  
6. Send Marcus a confirmation email with a link to the redacted page, explain where and how the original remains accessible on site (physical archive room, call number), and offer him a PDF of the redacted edition for his records.
