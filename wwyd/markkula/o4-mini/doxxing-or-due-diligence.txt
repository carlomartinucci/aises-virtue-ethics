I would grant the student’s request for anonymity and then take these concrete steps:

1. In my draft of the article, replace his real name with “Student A” (or another neutral pseudonym) and remove any direct identifiers (hall room number, exact Facebook URL, etc.).  
2. Add a parenthetical note on first reference—“(name withheld at source’s request)”—so readers know why he’s anonymous.  
3. Before going to copy editing, send the redacted draft back to the student with a short note:  
   “I’ve removed your name and identifying details. Please review to confirm that nothing in this version pinpoints you.”  
4. Simultaneously, run the redacted draft by my editor and the newspaper’s legal counsel to confirm we’re not inadvertently exposing him.  
5. In the final published article, include a brief editor’s note at the bottom:  
   “Note: The student interviewed for this story has requested anonymity. He originally posted about the “What Is Whiteness?” board on Facebook but has since deleted the post.”  
6. Archive all correspondence and the original unredacted interview transcript on our secure drives, so we can demonstrate to any internal or external review that the decision was deliberate and documented.
