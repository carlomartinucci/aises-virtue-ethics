1. Draft and circulate within 48 hours a “Joint Attendance Review Proposal” document that:  
   • Summarizes the Executive Cabinet’s stricter policy language side-by-side with senators’ proposed revisions (e.g. “three unexcused absences → three unexcused plus a written excuse within 72 hours”).  
   • Lists precise objectives both sides share (e.g. reduce no-shows by 50% over the semester).  
   • Offers two concrete compromise models:  
     – “Model A: Automated reminder emails 24 hours before each meeting, plus one mandatory one-on-one with the Chair after two absences.”  
     – “Model B: Maintain existing two-absence limit but automatically assign missed-meeting tasks to those absent (committee minutes summary, outreach to constituency).”

2. Appoint within one week a five-person “Attendance Task Force” composed of:  
   • Two Executive Cabinet representatives (e.g. VP and one Commissioner)  
   • Two Senate Committee Chairs (nominated by the Senate Chair caucus)  
   • Yourself as neutral Chair of the Task Force.

3. Schedule and run two consecutive 90-minute Task Force meetings (one next Thursday at 3 pm in the Student Government Suite; one the following Tuesday at 5 pm in the Senate conference room). For each meeting:  
   • Distribute the Proposal document (from step 1) at least 48 hours in advance.  
   • Use a timed agenda: 20 minutes for each side to present data or anecdotes, 30 minutes to workshop the two compromise models, 20 minutes to collect written feedback, 20 minutes for voting on which model to refine.

4. After the second meeting, publish a “Revised Attendance Policy Draft” by Friday afternoon:  
   • Highlight agreed-upon language in green and any remaining disputed sections in yellow.  
   • Attach a one-page “Impact Projection” chart with estimated attendance increases under each model (using past term’s absence data).

5. Present the draft at the next full Senate meeting:  
   • Open with a 5-minute walkthrough of how the Task Force process addressed both branches’ concerns.  
   • Facilitate a structured 30-minute “amend-and-vote” session: allow up to three friendly amendments in writing, then conduct a roll-call vote.  
   • If approved, forward the policy to the Executive Cabinet for final sign-off the following Monday; if not, reconvene the Task Force within one week to tackle only the voted-down sections.

By driving a time-boxed, transparent working group with concrete drafts, data, and structured votes, Karina both unblocks stalled debate and ensures neither branch feels steamrolled.
