I would embed a “human-in-the-loop” checkpoint between Tay and the live Twitter feed for at least the first 500 incoming exchanges, with these concrete steps:  
1. Spin up a separate message-queue service that pulls every tweet directed at Tay.  
2. Route each incoming tweet into a small moderation dashboard: display the tweet text, author handle, timestamp.  
3. Assign two trained content reviewers to scan each message for hate speech, slurs, coded insults, or attempts at “jailbreak” prompts.  
4. Only after both reviewers mark the tweet as “OK” will the system forward it to Tay’s NLP engine. If either flags it, the tweet is dropped and logged for review.  
5. After Tay generates a response, run it through the same dual-review process before posting.  
6. Keep a running log of all flagged inputs and outputs; run weekly data-mining to identify new attack patterns or emerging “trigger” phrases.  
7. Once you’ve processed 5,000 clean exchanges without any reviewer overrides, gradually increase the volume of auto-approved messages by 10% per week, continuing to log and audit all exceptions.
