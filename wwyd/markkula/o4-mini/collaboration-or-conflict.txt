I would immediately set up a three-way, in-person planning meeting with Alanna, my advisor, and RHA’s advisor—here’s exactly how:  
1. Draft a single email today by 5 pm with these elements:  
   • Recipients: Alanna; my Student Government advisor; RHA advisor.  
   • Subject: “Urgent: Joint Fair‐Planning Meeting, Date Options Inside.”  
   • Body: Provide three specific 1-hour meeting slots in the next five days (e.g. Monday 2 – 3 pm, Wednesday 10 – 11 am, Friday 4 – 5 pm); attach a two-page preliminary agenda listing “permits,” “vendor contacts,” “budget needs,” and “marketing timeline.”  
   • A polite but firm closing: “Please confirm one slot by end of day tomorrow so we can ensure vendors and permits stay on schedule.”  
2. While waiting for replies, I would book a neutral meeting room in the Student Union (reserve online now) and block it on my calendar.  
3. I would prepare a one-page shared Google Doc in advance—tabbed: Tasks, Deadlines, Owners—and share edit rights with Alanna and both advisors so that during the meeting we can assign each line item on the spot and record deadlines in real time.  
4. If Alanna still refuses to engage, at that meeting I’d ask the advisors to commit RHA to at least two delegate liaisons (names, emails) who will attend weekly Student Government planning sessions—this preserves the ten-year partnership while giving us the access we need to finalize permits and vendors.  
5. Immediately after the meeting, I’d send out meeting minutes with clearly marked “Action Items,” ownership, and due-dates; then follow up every three days until each item is closed.  

This concrete sequence forces RHA’s leadership to engage, brings in advisors as neutral arbiters, and creates a shared, transparent planning document so nothing slips through the cracks.
