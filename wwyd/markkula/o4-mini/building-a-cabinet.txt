1. Choose the third cabinet member by running a five‐person “fit and track” interview panel.  In addition to Marcus and Janelle, include the outgoing Senate Chair, one experienced staff adviser, and one neutral student-at-large.  Give each candidate (the three remaining opponents plus the pool of supporters) exactly 20 minutes to:  
   a. Describe one past project they led in student government.  
   b. Identify one situation where they faced internal conflict and what concrete steps they took to resolve it.  
   c. Outline in one paragraph the specific policy area or program they would own on cabinet and the first two deliverables they’d deliver by the end of term.  
   After scoring each answer on teamwork, conflict management, and deliverable-orientation (5 points each), pick the person with the highest total.  

2. Draft and send an offer email to that person within 24 hours.  In the same email:  
   – Attach a one-page “Exec Cabinet Role Charter” that spells out exactly which portfolio they own (e.g. “oversee campus sustainability task force,” or “manage the biweekly exec meeting agenda and minutes”).  
   – Embed a calendar link and ask them to pick three 30-minute slots next week for an onboarding meeting.  

3. At the onboarding meeting:  
   – Walk through the “Deliverables Calendar” showing all six cabinet members’ milestones and deadlines for the next three months.  Highlight their two agreed milestones.  
   – Assign them a peer-mentor on cabinet (whichever of the other two appointed members is most senior).  Ask them to set up weekly 15-minute check-ins with that mentor and share a shared Google Doc where they log progress.  
   – Agree on two concrete “KPIs” for their work (for example: number of student interviews conducted for the sustainability task force; or completion of an event proposal by a specific date).  

4. Institute a mid-term “health check” on October 1:  
   – The President, Vice President, Senate Chair and the staff adviser each fill out a one-page scorecard rating all three appointees on teamwork, follow-through, and initiative (1–5 scale).  
   – Convene a 30-minute group meeting on October 5 to review scores.  Where any appointee scores below 3 in any area, assign a corrective action (for example, pair them with a different project lead, or schedule additional meeting support).  

By running a structured panel, defining clear deliverables and check-ins, and building in a formal mid-term review, Marcus ensures he picks the strongest third member—whether opponent or supporter—while minimizing the risk of under-performance or post-election resentment.
