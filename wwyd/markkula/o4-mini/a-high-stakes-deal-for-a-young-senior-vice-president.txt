1. In Sam’s office, set the envelope of cash aside on his desk without touching it.  
2. Open his laptop, launch his company’s secure email system, and compose a message addressed to the in-house Compliance Officer and General Counsel.  
   • Subject line: “Urgent: Suspicious Amendment to Loan Purchase Agreement”  
   • Body: “I just received from Sam [Seller] an amended Agreement of Purchase I’ve never seen, plus $85,000 in cash, presented explicitly as payment for ‘regulatory reasons.’ I have not signed anything. Please advise next steps.”  
3. Attach a time-stamped photo of the altered agreement and a photo of the unopened envelope on Sam’s desk.  
4. Save the draft, then click “Send” and immediately request a read receipt.  
5. Pack up his briefcase—including the envelope of cash (unopened and clearly labeled “Evidence: Do Not Open”)—and head directly to the Compliance Officer’s office on the 18th floor.  
6. Hand the envelope and printed copies of the email-plus-photos to the Compliance Officer, asking her to log receipt in the company’s ethics hotline database.  
7. While Compliance is reviewing, call his boss (or the next person in line if his boss is unavailable) to say: “I’ve encountered a regulatory-sized amendment and a cash payment from Sam. I’ve escalated to Compliance and Legal and will keep you updated.”  
8. Follow up midday and end of day to confirm that Legal has placed a “hold” on signing authority for this transaction until the amendment and cash offer are fully vetted.
