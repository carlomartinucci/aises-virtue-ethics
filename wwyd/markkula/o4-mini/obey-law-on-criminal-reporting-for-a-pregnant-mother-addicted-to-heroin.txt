1. Within 24 hours, I complete and file the state’s mandatory child‐endangerment report form, documenting her positive heroin screen, her admission of use, and the estimated gestational age of her fetus. I send a copy to the hospital’s risk‐management office.  
2. Before she leaves today, I meet with our obstetric social worker and the hospital’s legal advocate to arrange two parallel tracks:  
   a. An immediate referral to the state‐funded inpatient perinatal‐addiction unit for medically supervised withdrawal—so that, as soon as CPS approves her placement, she can be admitted without delay. We prepare her medical records and the CPS report for transfer.  
   b. Contacting the hospital’s pro bono legal clinic to help her petition the court for diversion of criminal proceedings into a treatment‐first pathway, minimizing the chance of a criminal conviction or child‐removal order.  
3. I place orders for daily prenatal labs (liver function, HIV, hepatitis panel), NSTs beginning at 28 weeks, and biophysical profiles at 32 weeks, to monitor fetal well‐being once she’s in treatment.  
4. I start her on buprenorphine today (2 mg sublingual three times a day, titrating to suppress withdrawal) rather than inpatient methadone, since outpatient buprenorphine can be continued if she must leave the hospital unexpectedly. I give her a seven-day prescription, with next‐day follow-up scheduled with our perinatal addiction‐medicine clinic to adjust dosing.  
5. I introduce her to our on-site peer support specialist—another mother who completed a successful buprenorphine program while pregnant—and book twice-weekly counseling sessions in our clinic’s maternal-mental-health program.  
6. I arrange for a home‐visiting nurse to start biweekly visits at 20 weeks’ gestation, ensuring she has social support, a safe home environment, and help linking to WIC, SNAP, and subsidized housing programs.  
7. I schedule her next prenatal visit in seven days, at which point we will:  
   – Review her buprenorphine titration and withdrawal symptoms.  
   – Confirm CPS placement status for the inpatient unit.  
   – Enroll her in group prenatal care with other substance-exposed pregnancies.  
   – Update the perinatal social‐work plan, including legal‐clinic progress on diversion motions.  
8. I document in her chart all these steps and my rationale—that mandatory reporting was unavoidable under state law, but my concurrent goal is to maximize her access to voluntary, evidence-based treatment and legal advocacy so she can keep custody and carry to term safely.
