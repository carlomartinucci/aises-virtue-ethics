1. Open the student government’s print‐usage tracking system (or request the latest printer logs from IT) and export Julia’s monthly page counts for the last three months.  
2. Download the official “Office Supplies & Equipment” policy document from the student government intranet so you know the exact rules and permissible uses.  
3. Draft a one‐page comparison showing:  
   - Julia’s personal‐use pages versus her student‐government–use pages  
   - The cost (ink + paper) of her personal pages at current rates  
   - The organization’s monthly ink budget and how her personal use eats into it  
4. Email Julia to set up a 20-minute meeting. Subject line: “Print Usage Review & Reimbursement Proposal.” In the body, attach the comparison and the relevant policy excerpt.  
5. In the meeting:  
   a. Walk her through the numbers you prepared.  
   b. Point out the policy wording (e.g., “Office supplies are for student‐government tasks only”).  
   c. Say, “I value everything you do here. To keep us within budget, could you either route your homework printing through campus IT or reimburse the student government at cost?”  
6. If she agrees, prepare a simple reimbursement form: date, pages printed, rate per page, total owed, and have her sign it. Forward that to the treasurer with a cc to Julia.  
7. If she refuses, schedule a follow-up (give her one week). If still no agreement, send the same one‐page report plus her signed refusal email to the student government adviser or faculty supervisor, asking for advice on enforcing the reimbursement policy.
