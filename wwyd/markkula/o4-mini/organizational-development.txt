1. Draft a sponsorship packet this afternoon. In a single Google Doc, I’ll include:  
   • A one-page overview of our retreat’s goals and audience (25 student-leaders + staff)  
   • A menu of three sponsorship tiers (Bronze $250, Silver $500, Gold $1,000) with corresponding logo placement on retreat materials and shout-outs at opening/closing sessions  
   • A brief line-item budget showing we need $2,000 to cover the site cost increase  

2. Identify and list five local businesses by 5 PM today:  
   – The campus café that’s open to partnerships  
   – The town bookstore  
   – Two nearby banks with community grants  
   – A regional outdoor-gear shop  

3. Send personalized emails to each of the five businesses by tomorrow morning, attaching the sponsorship packet. In each email I will:  
   – Address the owner/manager by name  
   – Reference a past event we’ve participated in (e.g., “Thanks for hosting our fall job-fair booth in 2022.”)  
   – Close with a clear “Would you be willing to support our student retreat with a sponsorship? I’m happy to stop by next week to discuss details.”  

4. Schedule three 30-minute follow-up calls next week (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday between 3–5 PM) in my calendar. I’ll prepare a short script:  
   – Thank them for their time  
   – Outline what their money will accomplish (meals, meeting space, materials)  
   – Ask if they’d like to commit to one of the three tiers today  

5. If I secure at least $2,000 in sponsorships by next Friday, I will book the retreat site at the original doubled rate without touching student-body program funds. If I only raise $1,000 or less, I will reconvene the student government executive board immediately (by the following Monday) to decide whether to scale down the retreat’s duration or negotiate further with the site manager.
