I’d take these concrete steps:  
1. Review the bylaws on mid‐term vacancies. Note deadlines and processes for calling a special election or appointing an interim senator.  
2. Draft a one‐page “graduation succession plan” that spells out:  
   • My anticipated graduation date  
   • The exact week I’d hand off duties (5–6 weeks before spring term’s end)  
   • The process and timeline for running a special election or appointing an interim senator (nominating period, candidate forum, vote date)  
   • How I’ll train my replacement (two 2‐hour shadowing sessions, transition binder with committee contacts, project status reports)  
3. Two months before the election filing deadline, request a 30-minute meeting with the Student Government President and Elections Chair. In that meeting:  
   • Present my passion for the role and my graduation timetable  
   • Walk through my drafted succession plan and show I’ve matched it to bylaw requirements  
   • Ask them to confirm the vacancy procedure and sign off on my timeline so voters will see it on the ballot guide  
4. Revise the plan based on their feedback, then submit it to the Elections Office along with my candidate filing paperwork. Request that it be printed in full in the official candidate statement.  
5. During my campaign, hand out a one‐page flyer that transparently explains: “I will serve fall and winter quarter; here’s who and how I’ll train my interim senator for spring.” Invite students to meet both of us at a joint coffee hour so they know my successor.  
6. If elected, immediately begin biweekly training sessions with the nominated interim: run through committee agendas, introduce them to key contacts in Facilities, Student Life, Finance, and issue a shared Google Drive of all project documents.  
7. Six weeks before spring quarter ends, officially file the vacancy notice with the Elections Office, confirming my successor’s candidacy and presenting our joint transition report to the full senate.  

That way, I honor my commitment to students, comply with the rules, and ensure no gap in representation.
