Ben leans forward and says to JP and the group:  
“Thank you, JP, for arranging this visit and for showing me how proud you all are of the extra income. I can see that the families value the work—and I respect that. What I cannot do, however, is give my company’s endorsement to any program that has children under fourteen operating those looms. Our global sourcing policy—and U.S. standards I’m accountable for—require no child labor under 14, and that we take active steps to protect any 14-to-17-year-olds from hazardous tasks.  

So here’s what I’d like to propose, starting tomorrow:  
1. We pause any production involving children under 14. I’ll ask your local company contact to remove those looms and relocate them to an adult cooperative or to a vocational-training center in Chennai.  
2. We bring in a local NGO—say, Save the Children India or Pratham—to set up a daytime learning program for every child here under 14, funded by a small portion of the adults’ loom rents. That way no family loses immediate income, and the kids get reading, writing and vocational skills.  
3. We convert part of the project revenue into a micro-scholarship that pays each child’s parent a stipend while the child attends school. I’ll draft a simple agreement that you and the village head can review in your temple office next week.  
4. Once we have written confirmation of those two steps—looms removed from under-14s and an educational program funded—we’ll reconvene (you, me, the company’s Chennai director and the NGO) and I’ll be able to give you the green light to expand this project to other villages.  

If we move quickly, we can have the schooling element running within 30 days, and I’ll fly back in six weeks to see the classrooms in action. Does that sound workable?”  

He pauses to let JP nod, then adds:  
“Please understand I’m fully behind creating sustainable income here. What I cannot do is sign off on any business model that leaves children exposed to hazards or out of school. But with these concrete steps—loom relocation, NGO partnership, school stipends—we can turn this into a model our company proudly supports.”
