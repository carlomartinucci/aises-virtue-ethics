1. Within 24 hours, email the Vice President and request a 30-minute meeting to discuss refining the Marketing role’s responsibilities and adding a co-director position.  
2. Draft a one-page proposal before the meeting that:  
   a. Breaks the Marketing portfolio into two sub-areas—Social Media & Digital Outreach (e.g., Instagram campaigns, email newsletters) and Event Branding & Print Materials (e.g., posters, tabling displays).  
   b. Defines “Co-Director of Marketing, Social Media & Digital Outreach” as a new spot with specific deliverables (posting schedule, engagement metrics) that your friend could step into immediately.  
   c. Proposes you keep the Event Branding & Print Materials portfolio—and earmark two hours per week to partner with the Women’s Affairs and Community Service directors on at least one cross-functional project each month.  
3. In the meeting, present your one-page and say: “I want to leverage my graphic design skills on print and campus events, while handing off the social-media push to someone as enthusiastic as [Friend’s Name]. That way, we get stronger results in both areas and I can still spearhead at least one Women’s Affairs initiative a semester.”  
4. After securing agreement from the President and Vice President, call your friend within 12 hours:  
   a. Tell her you’ve arranged the Co-Director Social Media slot and walk her through the role’s deliverables and timeline (e.g., 3 posts/week, monthly engagement report).  
   b. Confirm she’s on board, then send her the official job-share description and ask for her written acceptance.  
5. Once your friend accepts in writing, update the student government’s organizational chart and public website by the end of the week to reflect:  
   • Director of Marketing, Event Branding & Print: Leah  
   • Co-Director of Marketing, Social Media & Digital Outreach: [Friend’s Name]  
6. Simultaneously, draft a six-month plan for a joint project between Marketing and Women’s Affairs—such as a leadership‐skills workshop for first-year women—so you can demonstrate your impact outside pure marketing by semester’s end.
