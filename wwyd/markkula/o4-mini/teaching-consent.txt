I would convene a two-hour co-design workshop with 8–10 neurodiverse students and a professional instructional designer. In that session we would:  
1. Present the existing consent material side by side with three real-world scenarios (e.g. “dancing at a party,” “watching a movie on the couch,” “studying together in the dorm”).  
2. Ask each student to highlight exactly which words or phrases felt unclear or vague.  
3. For each highlighted point, have the group draft a single, concrete rewrite—for example, replacing “use physical cues” with “say ‘Would you like me to kiss you?’ and wait for ‘yes’ before moving closer.”  
4. Sketch a simple flowchart on a whiteboard that maps out each step: “ask a yes/no question → pause for answer → interpret only a clear ‘yes’ as consent → proceed.”  
5. End by testing those rewrites in short role-play exercises, noting any remaining confusion.  

Afterward, I’d collect all notes, finalize a new PDF with side-by-side “old vs. new” examples, the flowchart, and two illustrated scripts (“how to ask,” “how to respond”) and deliver it to the prevention center for immediate inclusion online and in print.
