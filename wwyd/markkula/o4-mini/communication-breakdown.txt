I would take the following concrete action: convene an off-campus Greek Life Safety Task Force, gather data and student testimony, and use that packet to force a focused conversation with the Vice Provost. Specifically:  
1. Within one week, send an all-Greek email inviting each fraternity and sorority president to a “Greek Life Safety Task Force” meeting in Student Government offices. Ask them to bring (a) a one-page summary of any theft or vandalism incident, (b) names and dates, and (c) two or three bullet points on how they’ve tried to resolve it.  
2. At that meeting, elect two co-chairs (one fraternity president, one sorority president) and assign each chapter a 24-hour window to submit a signed incident report. By day ten, you’ll have a packet of 20–30 stamped, signed reports that document the problem.  
3. Draft a 2-page “Off-Campus Greek Life Safety Proposal” that includes:  
   • A summary chart of reported thefts, dates, locations  
   • Two brief firsthand student quotes about how these incidents affect study and community life  
   • A concrete ask: for example, “University security to perform one weekly off-campus neighborhood patrol,” or “funding for door-security workshops”  
4. Email the Vice Provost’s office with that proposal and request a 30-minute bi-weekly meeting slot (separate from your regular agenda) explicitly titled “Greek Life Safety Initiative.” In the body of the email, attach the signed petition (25+ student signatures or chapter signatures) and the 2-page proposal.  
5. At the meeting, begin by handing her the packet, say: “I know Greek life isn’t officially recognized, but 40 percent of our students live off campus in Greek houses. Here are documented incidents and a student-led recommendation. We need your support on this specific ask so we can keep our students safe.” If she declines, immediately follow up within 24 hours by posting the 2-page proposal and petition on the Associated Students website under “Unmet Student Needs,” cc’ing Student Affairs, the Dean of Students, and the campus newspaper.  

By creating a formal Task Force, gathering signed incident reports, submitting a sharp two-page proposal with a clear funding or policy request, and then either securing a dedicated meeting or going public via the website and newspaper, Derek forces the administration to engage on a concrete issue rather than let him “spin” it away.
