I would take these concrete steps:

1.  Draft and submit a one‐paragraph recusal statement to the Associated Students clerk’s office before the petition review begins. In it I’d say, “Because I am an active member of the Outdoor Adventure Club, I will not participate in any board discussions, subcommittee meetings, or votes that involve their recognition petition.”

2.  Ask the AS President to reassign any motions or review tasks related to the Outdoor Adventure Club to another executive (for example, the Vice Chair of Club Affairs), so that I never see their application materials, sit in on their hearings, or cast ballots on their status.

3.  Confirm in writing (e-mail) with the clerk and with the Vice Chair of Club Affairs that they have received and logged my recusal, and that they will handle all club‐recognition duties for that petition. Save those emails in a dedicated “Conflict of Interest” folder.

4.  Remain a regular (non-officer) member of the Outdoor Adventure Club so I can still attend trips and participate, but relinquish any leadership role, petition‐writing team membership, or official liaison duties for at least this recognition cycle.

5.  Before the next election cycle, revisit my workload and consider whether I should reapply for Outdoor Club office once I no longer serve on the AS board.

By formally recusing, documenting it, and shifting review responsibilities to a colleague, I preserve my AS‐board integrity without resigning entirely from the club or missing out on its activities.
