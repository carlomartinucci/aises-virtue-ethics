1. Disclose your role to Christian and in the story’s byline  
   – Send Christian a brief email: “I volunteer with the student social‐justice group sponsoring the protest. I want you to know so we can evaluate any perceived conflicts.”  
   – In the published article, add a one‐sentence “Reporter’s Note”: “The author volunteers with [Group Name], which is organizing the protest.”  

2. Map out every category of stakeholder you’ll quote  
   – Custodial staff members (at least three individuals of different seniority levels)  
   – School administration (facilities director or HR rep)  
   – Independent expert (e.g., a local labor‐relations professor or union representative with no direct ties to the group)  
   – A student leader unaffiliated with the protest for a peer perspective  

3. Collect and verify core facts before you write a single draft  
   – Request the custodial staff’s official pay and scheduling records from the campus HR office under the school’s public‐records policy.  
   – Obtain the administration’s written response or policy on custodial wages and workload.  
   – Compare the school’s data against publicly available wage standards (e.g., state minimum wage history, regional cost‐of‐living studies).  

4. Conduct interviews with full transparency and record every session  
   – At the start of each interview, state on-record: “I’m reporting for The Campus Times. I volunteer with [Group Name], and I want to ensure you understand my perspective as well as maintain journalistic rigor.”  
   – Use a digital recorder. Save files under a naming convention (e.g., “2024-04-CustodianA”).  

5. Draft the article in sections, tagging each quote by source type  
   – Label each block: [Staff-Quote], [Admin-Quote], [Expert-Quote], [Peer-Quote].  
   – After writing, review to confirm balanced representation—no single group exceeds 40% of total quotes.  

6. Submit to an independent fact‐checker or faculty advisor  
   – Ask the faculty adviser in the journalism department (or the paper’s copy editor) to verify that all factual claims match your source documents.  
   – Incorporate any flagged inconsistencies before final approval.  

By disclosing your affiliation upfront, systematically diversifying and verifying sources, and involving an independent reviewer, you’ll produce a detailed, credible story without allowing your personal ties to skew your reporting.
