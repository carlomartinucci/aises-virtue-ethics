1. As soon as Ali indicates he has multiple concerns and especially notes shortness of breath, I would interrupt the routine flow of the appointment and say, “Ali, I want to make sure I don’t miss anything that could be urgent. Give me your pen and paper.”  
2. I would rapidly scan his written list and circle “shortness of breath” in red.  
3. I would hand Ali back the pen and paper, say, “We’ll address the rest in a follow-up, but right now I need to get you vital signs, an EKG, and a quick cardiac enzyme test—in the next five minutes.”  
4. I would direct the nurse immediately to check blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and draw labs for troponin, then place Ali on the clinic EKG machine.  
5. If the EKG shows ischemic changes or troponin is elevated, I would call the on-call cardiology service and arrange for Ali to be transferred directly to the hospital’s cardiac unit for monitoring and further workup.
