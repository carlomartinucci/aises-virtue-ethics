1) Log into our clinic’s psychiatric e-Consult portal and open a new consult.  In the consult request form I will:  
   • Summarize Peter’s history (onset of mood swings, antidepressant trials, refusal of formal psych referral).  
   • Attach his latest PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores plus a completed Mood Disorder Questionnaire.  
   • Ask specifically: “Does this presentation meet criteria for bipolar II disorder? If so, what first-line mood stabilizer would you recommend, and at what starting dose and monitoring schedule?”  

2) Send the e-Consult and schedule a brief 15-minute follow-up call with Peter in one week to:  
   • Review the psychiatrist’s recommendations.  
   • Discuss initiation of any recommended mood stabilizer (e.g., lithium 300 mg BID).  
   • Order baseline labs (CBC, electrolytes, TSH, renal function) and set up lab monitoring every 2–4 weeks.  

3) Provide Peter with a printed action plan that week:  
   • Medication dosing schedule.  
   • Laboratory appointments (with dates and locations).  
   • A one-page mood chart for him to track daily highs/lows and side effects.  

4) Document in the chart:  
   • His refusal of an in-person psychiatric appointment.  
   • That I used e-Consult per our integrated-care protocol.  
   • The treatment plan steps, labs ordered, and follow-up timeline.  

5) On our next in-clinic visit (in 4 weeks):  
   • Review his mood chart and lab results.  
   • Adjust medication per the psychiatrist’s written guidance.  
   • Re-offer a telepsychiatry session if stabilization remains incomplete.
