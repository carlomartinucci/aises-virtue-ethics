1. Draft an email to Jack by 5 PM today with the subject line “Urgent: Requested Revisions on Your Affirmative Action Op-Ed.”  
2. In the email, paste the Admissions Office statement verbatim:  
   “The University does not consider race in undergraduate admissions; all applicants are evaluated on academic merit in a blind file review.”  
3. Ask Jack to revise his draft so that each claim about “affirmative action policies” is either removed or replaced with an argument about hypothetical policies at other institutions, explicitly acknowledging that our school does not use race as an admissions criterion.  
4. Attach the university’s official admissions brochure and the Admissions Office’s process flowchart (which Elena downloaded from their intranet) so Jack can cite accurate facts.  
5. Set a firm deadline of tomorrow at noon for Jack to submit the revised draft.  
6. Tell Jack that if he cannot make those changes, the piece cannot run in our paper, but we would be happy to consider an alternative opinion on a different topic.  
7. Once Jack’s revisions arrive, schedule a 15-minute fact-check call with our reporter in charge of campus affairs to verify any remaining data points before approving the final copy for publication.
