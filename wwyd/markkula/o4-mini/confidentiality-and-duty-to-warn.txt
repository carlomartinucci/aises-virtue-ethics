1. I would pick up the phone right away and call my county’s designated Threat Assessment Liaison at the Sheriff’s Office (or local police if no liaison exists).  In that call I would:  
   • Identify myself, my role, and the fact that I’m calling under my mandated-duty-to-warn/Tarasoff requirements.  
   • Give the client’s name and date of birth, and describe that he has made a specific plan to stalk and “scare” Susan and her boyfriend on an upcoming date.  
   • Provide the date/time of our last session, the exact words he used (“stalk,” “catch them and give them a good scare”), and the level of detail he’s provided about how he would carry it out.  
   • Ask the officer how best to proceed so they can monitor that date and take protective measures for Susan and her boyfriend.  

2. Immediately after the call, I would document in my clinical record:  
   • Time of the call, who I spoke with, badge or liaison number, and their instructions to me.  
   • The precise statements from the client that triggered the warning.  

3. I would then place a brief, factual call to Susan at work (or leave a voicemail if she’s not available), identifying myself as her coworker’s therapist, and saying, “I’m calling because I have a serious safety concern that I’m legally required to share.  I’ve notified law enforcement, and they will be checking in on you both.  I want you to feel free to call 911 directly if you ever feel unsafe.”  

4. Finally, I would schedule an emergency follow-up with my clinic’s on-call psychiatrist to discuss whether to pursue a 72-hour psychiatric hold for my client, given the clear risk of stalking behavior.
