I would set up a secure, invitation-only briefing for trusted community-based organizations and legal-aid groups the evening before the raids rather than holding a public press conference. Here’s exactly how:  
1. Draft a one-page advisory memo describing the timing (day, approximate window), locations (city neighborhoods), and ICE’s legal authority, vetted by the city attorney to ensure no violation of obstruction laws.  
2. Compile contact lists for the five largest immigrant-defense nonprofits, two faith-based groups, and three neighborhood associations focused on East and West Oakland.  
3. Send each group a personalized encrypted email (using PGP or a secure portal) inviting them to a 6 p.m. meeting at City Hall Room 101. Include the advisory memo as a PDF attachment.  
4. At 6 p.m., host a closed-door session: I’d present the memo, explain the legal limits on city participation, supply printed “know-your-rights” flyers in English and Spanish, and distribute hotline numbers for local pro bono attorneys.  
5. Instruct each group to use their own trusted outreach channels—text blasts, WhatsApp groups, phone trees—to alert their members without broader media coverage.  
6. Immediately after, have the city attorney file a short memo into the public record confirming that no city resources were used to obstruct enforcement, and publish the “know-your-rights” flyers on the city website.  

By keeping the warning confined to vetted community partners and documenting every step with the city attorney, I would protect vulnerable residents without triggering a public panic or undermining lawful ICE operations.
