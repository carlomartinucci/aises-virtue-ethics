I would organize a hands-on public “inspect-and-test” workshop in one of the neighborhoods slated for new lampposts. 具体步骤：  
1. Book a community center for an afternoon, invite 20–30 local residents by mail and social media.  
2. Bring one complete lamppost sensor unit (LED light head, sensor pod, network module) on a wheeled stand.  
3. Lay out all components on a table with labels: camera module, mic array, motion sensor, communications board.  
4. Demonstrate live how to disable each function in the embedded software (e.g. flip the “audio_capture” flag off in the web UI, unplug the camera ribbon cable).  
5. Hand out simple screwdrivers and let residents pop open the sensor pod themselves, inspect and reseal it.  
6. Run a live dashboard showing “before” (motion + audio on) and “after” (only light level + temperature) so they see that no images or sounds are being captured.  
7. Distribute a one-page printout with step-by-step commands and photos so anyone can verify feature-disabling in the field.  
8. Record the workshop, post the video and source code for the disable-scripts on a public GitHub repo.  
By the end of the session, residents will have personally disabled the surveillance functions, handled the hardware, and downloaded the exact same scripts we’ll ship on every lamppost.
