I would pick up the phone right after our session and call New Hope Community Counseling (the local nonprofit mental–health clinic that offers sliding-scale rates). I’d say, “Hi, this is Pastor Smith from First Baptist. One of my members, John Thompson, is showing signs of depression and relapse risk. He’s uninsured and insists he won’t go unless I help set it up. Do you have a next-available intake slot—ideally this week? And can you bill him at your lowest self-pay rate?” 

Then I would:  
1. Get their earliest appointment date and time.  
2. Write it on John’s appointment card before he leaves the church.  
3. Email—and with John’s permission, CC him—a brief referral note: “John Thompson, DOB 3/12/68, facing depressive symptoms and alcohol-use risk. Pastor referral.”  
4. Offer to drive him there or meet him in their waiting room so he shows up.  
5. Follow up by text the evening before his appointment to remind him and offer prayer.
