I would take these concrete steps:

1. Convene a 30-minute “fit-assessment” meeting with each of the three remaining candidates.  • Send each candidate a 48-hour notice with a brief agenda: “We’d like to ask you two technology-scenario questions for IT Services,” or “We’d like to run one mock student-policy discussion for Academic Affairs,” or “We’d like to hear about a student-college coordination plan for Student Affairs.”  • In each meeting, present exactly two real committee tasks (for example, “Sketch out how you’d roll out a campus-wide Wi-Fi outage notice” for IT). Record how they answer.

2. Score each candidate immediately after their mini-interview on three concrete metrics:  • Technical knowledge (0–5 points) for IT Services;  • Knowledge of academic rules/policies (0–5) for Academic Affairs;  • College-outreach plan clarity (0–5) for Student Affairs.  

3. Compare those scores to a simple cutoff (e.g. 12/15).  
   – If any candidate meets or exceeds 12, offer them the committee seat.  
   – If none reaches 12, proceed to step 4.

4. Invite your qualified friends—but only via the same process you used for the general applicant pool:  
   • Email them the public application link.  
   • Give them 72 hours to submit.  
   • Slot them into a 30-minute fit-assessment meeting using the same two-scenario format and scoring rubric you just applied.  

5. Offer the seat to whoever scores highest on the rubric, regardless of whether they were an outgoing candidate or one of your friends. 6. Once all three seats are filled, email the remaining applicants:  
   • Thank them by name for their time.  
   • Encourage them to apply next term or to volunteer with another campus group (link provided).  

By running the same short interview and scoring for everyone—original applicants and friends—you ensure you’re truly matching committee needs to demonstrated ability, rather than making ad-hoc exceptions.
