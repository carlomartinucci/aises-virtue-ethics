1. Pull the latest Global Engineering & Construction conflict‐of‐interest and subcontractor‐management policies from the intranet, print them out side by side, and highlight any passages on personal relationships with vendors or on reassignment of project oversight.  
2. Draft a one‐page “Conflict of Interest Declaration” form (using the language and format in our policy manual) and send it to Roy with a calendar invite for a 30-minute meeting in my office two days later. In the meeting I will say:  
   • “Per company policy section 5.3 on vendor relationships, I need every project lead to disclose any personal ties to subcontractors.”  
   • Hand him the blank form and ask him to complete it on the spot, then file it with HR and procurement.  
3. Simultaneously email Procurement and cc HR:  
   “Per our conversation today, please flag Hotspark Electrical on projects 23-E, 24-A and 25-B for secondary quality reviews. Going forward, please assign any oversight of Hotspark to my assistant manager, Jane Liu, until Roy’s disclosure is resolved.”  
4. After Roy signs and submits the form, forward his declaration to Finance (for audit trails) and to the president’s office, noting: “Roy Stalward has disclosed a personal relationship with the GM’s daughter at Hotspark Electrical. We have reassigned all Hotspark oversight to Jane Liu and requested secondary QA on current packages.”  
5. File copies of all emails, the signed declaration, and the calendar invitation in my personal project folder, so there is a clear paper trail showing I identified the risk, enforced policy, and insulated Global from any future quality or favoritism problems with Hotspark.
