I’m one of the Gamma Group Omaha engineers. Here’s what I would do step by concrete step:

1.  Gather my personal file and employment paperwork.  Right after Ralph’s Friday afternoon exit, I’d retrieve my offer letter, employment agreement, any non-compete or confidentiality clauses, and my personnel file from HR (or request copies immediately by e-mail).

2.  Review my non-compete/confidentiality.  I’d read any restrictions on soliciting clients or jumping straight to a competitor.  If there’s a six‐month non-solicitation clause, I need to know the exact language and effective dates.

3.  Send a formal inquiry to Boston.  Still that Friday, I’d e-mail HR (cc’ing my direct supervisor) asking for an urgent online meeting or phone call next Monday morning to clarify who’s running Omaha and how they intend to preserve my role, projects, benefits, salary and tenure.

4.  Notify key clients I’m staying.  Over the weekend, I’d draft personal e-mails to each of my top three clients, saying: “I learned of Ralph’s departure; just to reassure you, I’m still here at Gamma Group Omaha and remain fully available to support you on X and Y projects. Please let me know if you have any concerns or immediate needs.”

5.  Decline Karla’s recruitment call.  If Karla rings to recruit me, I’d tell her: “I value my Gamma Group standing, I need full clarity from my own employer before entertaining any outside offers. Please leave your materials with me and I’ll get back to you once I’ve spoken to Gamma HR.”

6.  Push for a stabilization plan.  At the Monday meeting with Boston, I’d insist they assign an interim branch manager immediately (naming two or three senior people from other offices) and I’d volunteer to lead the transition team to avoid further client disruption.

7.  Document every conversation.  I’d keep dated notes of each call or e-mail—both with Gamma HQ and with clients—to protect myself if disputes arise over client solicitation or contract obligations.

8.  Re-evaluate my options after their response.  If Boston commits to back-filling management, honors my current salary and outlines a growth plan, I stay.  If they dodge, delay or threaten to shave my pay, I’d then revisit Compass’s offer—only after confirming no contractual barrier exists.
