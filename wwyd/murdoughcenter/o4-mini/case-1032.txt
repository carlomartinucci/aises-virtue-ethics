1. I open my desktop CAD folder and export the Windsor Ridge site‐plan PDF, including the grading and drainage overlay.  
2. I log into my City of Plebian e-mail account, compose a new message to “stopgrowth@plebianpreserve.org” (the working address of the anti-development coalition), and attach:  
   - The full site plan PDF with the drainage contour lines.  
   - A brief memo I write in the body of the email titled “URGENT: Downstream Impact Analysis,” summarizing:  
     a. The estimated increase in peak runoff—about 45 cubic feet per second—discharging toward the Primitive Baptist Church cemetery.  
     b. The lack of a compensatory detention basin sized for a 100-year storm.  
     c. The potential for flooding and property damage to six long-time resident farms.  
3. Under the memo, I type a closing line: “Please circulate this to the Plebian Heritage Land Defense Team before tomorrow’s council meeting. They can use it to request an immediate hold on approvals pending independent hydraulic modeling.”  
4. I BCC my personal Gmail account for a timestamped copy, then hit “Send.”  
5. I pick up the land-use binder for Windsor Ridge, make a handwritten note on page 12: “See email sent to PHLDT on 4/12 @ 3:15 pm regarding drainage concerns,” and place that binder on the front shelf of my office—where visiting council members can’t miss it if they start reviewing compliance.  
6. Finally, I call my friend Sarah Jones, chair of Plebian Preserve, on her cell at 4:22 pm. I say: “Sarah, I just sent you detailed drainage maps. I really think you should forward them to the mayor and ask for an emergency meeting before they rubber-stamp Windsor Ridge.” Then I hang up.
