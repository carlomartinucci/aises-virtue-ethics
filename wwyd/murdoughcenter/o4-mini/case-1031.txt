1. That afternoon, open a remote session to the Exchange server (or local mail store) rather than to each PC.  
2. In Exchange Management Shell (or your mail‐server console) enable message tracking and journaling for the mailboxes in question:  
   • Set-TransportConfig –JournalingEnabled $true  
   • New-JournalRule –Name “NorthLink Personal Mail Audit” –Scope Global –JournalMailbox “AuditJournal” –Enabled $true  
3. Create a PowerShell script that daily:  
   a. Queries the MessageTrackingLog for the previous 24 hours:  
      $logs = Get-MessageTrackingLog –Start (Get-Date).AddDays(-1) –End (Get-Date)  
   b. Filters out internal‐to‐internal mail, keeping only messages with external recipients or senders.  
   c. Exports the results as CSV with columns “Sender,” “Recipient,” “DateTime,” “Subject.”  
4. Secure that CSV on a locked-down share (permissions: only Gwen and Lawrence).  
5. Schedule the script as a Windows Task (“DailyMailAudit”) to run at 6 PM each evening, sending the CSV by e-mail to Lawrence.  
6. Test the task immediately (run it manually, verify you get a CSV with no actual message bodies, only metadata).  
7. Inform Lawrence by e-mail:  
   “I’ve implemented Exchange journaling and message‐tracking rules. Beginning tonight, you’ll receive a daily report showing sender, recipient, date/time, and subject for any message with an external address. No message bodies will be included. Let me know if you need any adjustment to the filters.”  
8. Document the configuration and keep copies of the PowerShell script and task settings in the IT operations folder.
