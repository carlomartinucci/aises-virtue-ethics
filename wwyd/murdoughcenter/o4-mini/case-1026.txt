1. Immediately call Ernest Downholt and tell him to have the driller mobilize the rig back to this site first thing Monday morning.  Specify the exact station coordinates for each of the 18 borings, using the GPS waypoints from our original plan.  
2. In the same call, instruct Ernest to assign one of our field geologists to accompany the drill crew.  Tell him that this geologist’s sole job is to log soil samples and spot‐check drill depths and recoveries at every boring.  
3. Draft an e-mail this afternoon to the client’s project manager informing them that we have discovered no visible evidence of the original borings.  Explain that, in order to guarantee accurate foundation‐design parameters, we will re-conduct the field exploration early next week and deliver our report by Friday of next week instead of Thursday.  (This shifts the deadline by one business day.)  
4. Block out Monday through Wednesday on Jack’s calendar for daily site visits.  Each morning, Jack will arrive on site first thing, meet with the driller and geologist, and personally verify the position and depth for at least three random borings using his handheld GPS and a measuring tape.  
5. Set up a shared project folder in our lab network labeled “Office Bldg Exploration – Re-run” and require the drilling crew to upload their daily depth logs, sample photos, and “stand‐by” logs by 5 pm each day.  Jack will review them that evening and call the geologist or driller on any discrepancies before signing off on Monday’s through Wednesday’s field data.
