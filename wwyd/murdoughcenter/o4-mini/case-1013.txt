1. Prepare a signed “Dissenting Engineering Note” in which I restate exactly what I found—namely, the long-time resident’s report of creosote operations beneath the mall, my recommendation for a Phase 2 investigation to soil- and groundwater‐sample under the slab, and the basis for that recommendation.  I will date and sign that Note as the Responsible Environmental Professional.  
2. Attach that Note as an addendum to the draft report I originally sent to Dewey, Stickum & Howe, giving it its own cover page marked “Engineering Professional Judgment—Non-Concurrence.”  
3. E-mail the combined package—(a) the Dewey-edited report, plus (b) my signed addendum—to all three of these addresses simultaneously:  
   – The Americorp in-house environmental manager, with a “read receipt” request.  
   – Charlie Howe at Dewey, Stickum & Howe.  
   – My own firm’s Director of Environmental Compliance (or Legal Counsel) with a brief “for your records” cover note.  
4. In the same e-mail to Americorp, explicitly state:  
   “Pursuant to my state Professional Engineer registration and ASTM E1527-13 practice standards, I must record the known information about potential creosote contamination and my Phase 2 recommendation.  I have appended that record as a non-concurrence.  Please advise if you want me to file a voluntary notice with the NJDEP.”  
5. Call the NJ Department of Environmental Protection hotline, advise them that I have become aware of credible reports of creosote residuals at 123 Mall Drive, and ask whether they recommend any immediate steps or whether a voluntary investigation notice should be filed.  I take notes of the time, the person I spoke to, and their advice.  
6. File those NJDEP “initial notice” or “voluntary investigation” forms by the close of business today, attaching a copy of my signed Dissenting Engineering Note.  

By taking these steps, I:  
• Formally record my professional judgment in writing and preserve my PE seal and signature on it.  
• Ensure both client and regulators have the full information on file.  
• Protect Enviro/Universal—and myself—from professional‐liability exposure if contamination later emerges.  
• Keeps the refinancing transaction moving forward (I still deliver the Dewey-approved report) while preserving the Phase 2 recommendation in a separate, professionally sealed addendum.
