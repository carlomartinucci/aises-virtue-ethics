I would take the following concrete steps:

1. Decline Owatadeel’s proposal in writing.   
   • Send him an email today: “Thank you for your proposal.  At this time Choice Engineering will not retain International Affiliates Ltd. on a contingent‐fee or gift‐funding basis.  We appreciate your willingness to help and will contact you if our requirements change.”  

2. Engage U.S. legal counsel for FCPA compliance.   
   • By close of business tomorrow, ask our in-house counsel or an outside U.S. anti-corruption attorney to review Utopian registration requirements and local-agent agreements.  
   • Obtain a one-page memo from counsel on permissible payment structures (flat fees for bona fide services vs. “facilitation” or “gift” payments that could run afoul of U.S. law).  

3. Identify and vet three alternative Utopian engineering firms with no history of bribery or commission arrangements.   
   • Use international directories (ENR‘s “Top Global Design Firms,” LinkedIn, local U.S. Embassy trade-office listings) to compile a list by end of this week.  
   • Contact each by e-mail and phone to request statements of capability and standard hourly rates or fixed‐fee schedules—explicitly excluding gift‐giving or marketing allowances.  
   • Require audited financials or at least bank-references to ensure they’re legitimate providers of engineering, permitting and liaison services rather than “commission brokers.”  

4. Create a “Choice Engineering–Utopia Local Partner” agreement template.   
   • Draft a short subcontract that defines clear deliverables (permitting applications, government liaison, site surveys), a fixed‐fee cap, FCPA‐compliant clauses, and monthly reporting.  
   • Circulate the draft next week to the three vetted firms, asking them to mark up within five business days.  

5. Present Obigee with a compliant, transparent proposal by mid‐month.   
   • Bundle our U.S. team’s design scope and budget with the chosen local partner’s fixed fees and a single line item for “government liaison services.”  
   • Explain that Choice’s structure ensures one accountable team, on time and on budget, without any hidden commissions or gifts.  

By replacing the high-risk retainer/gift approach with a clean, fixed-fee local‐partner model—and confirming via legal counsel that it meets FCPA and Utopian law—I preserve our competitive position without exposing Choice Engineering or Obigee’s board members to bribery allegations.
