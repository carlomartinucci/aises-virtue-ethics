I would refuse the plaintiff’s $15,000 offer and, with my outside counsel, immediately file a motion for summary judgment. Specifically:  
1. Assemble the documented evidence: our written design‐report comments instructing the bank to secure permission, the contractor’s daily reports showing tiebacks installed under bank direction, and correspondence proving we never directed or benefited from the encroachment.  
2. Draft the motion arguing (a) there is no genuine dispute of material fact that our firm explicitly warned—and repeatedly reminded—the bank to obtain the neighboring owner’s consent, and (b) under the governing professional‐services agreement we owed no duty to the adjacent owner.  
3. Produce a concise statement of undisputed facts supported by affidavits from the project manager and the structural engineer confirming they alone handled owner approvals.  
4. File the motion two business days before trial, request oral argument, and serve a copy on all parties.  

By pressing for summary judgment rather than paying the settlement, we force the court to recognize that the bank and the contractor (who ignored our written warning) are the only parties potentially liable for trespass.
