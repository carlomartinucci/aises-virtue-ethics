I would prepare—and electronically submit to the A/E and contractor—a final, signed geotechnical report that:  
1. Reiterates the field and laboratory data showing moderately compressible soils;  
2. Presents settlement versus time curves demonstrating that damage will occur after the first year;  
3. Specifies driven‐pile foundations (with pile type, length, required design capacity and installation criteria) as my sole recommendation;  
4. Includes a “Limitations and Use of Report” section stating that any alternative shallow‐foundation design was neither analyzed nor approved;  
5. Is stamped and signed under my professional seal and clearly dated.  

Simultaneously, I would send the contractor a short e-mail documenting their request to change my recommendation and my decision to stand by the piled‐foundation design, so there is an audit trail in case of nonpayment or later dispute.
