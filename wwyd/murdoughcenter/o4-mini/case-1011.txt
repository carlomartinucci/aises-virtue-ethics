1. Send John Bigge an engagement‐letter template by 5:00 p.m. today requesting authorization to begin work, along with our standard fee schedule and scope outline for a final engineering design.  
2. In that same e-mail, ask him to forward the complete Weeks & Weeks preliminary report, all planning-commission review comments, and any geotechnical or environmental data they’ve already collected.  
3. As soon as he confirms the engagement, block off two consecutive days next week on our calendar for a site‐reconnaissance visit—bringing our senior geotechnical engineer and civil‐design lead—to verify ground conditions (peat depth, fill quality, groundwater table) and to mark critical benchmarks for surveying.  
4. Within 48 hours of the site visit, prepare and submit to Ramrod:  
   • A detailed work plan listing each design task (drainage infrastructure, earthwork, pavement section, utilities coordination)  
   • A proposed schedule with key milestones (30% design submittal, 60% site plan review, final issue for permit)  
   • A risk summary calling out any assumptions (e.g., “assuming existing fill achieves a minimum CBR of 8%”) so we can immediately flag any scope or budget impacts if field tests differ.
