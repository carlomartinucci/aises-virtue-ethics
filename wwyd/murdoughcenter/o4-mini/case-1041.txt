I would take these concrete steps immediately:  
1. Halt any further work on the concrete tank pour at the start of next shift.  
2. That morning, call Valencia‐area certified concrete contractor “Hormigonados López” (or another licensed firm) and negotiate a one-day subcontract for their foreman plus two experienced crewmembers to handle the tank formwork, rebar inspection, and concrete pour.  
3. Send my boss a short e-mail by 10 a.m. documenting:  
 • Why the Ecuadorian crew lacks the certifications for high-risk concrete work  
 • My subcontract agreement with Hormigonados López (foreman arrives in 48 hours)  
 • A revised project schedule showing we still meet the one-month deadline  
4. In parallel, that same morning submit work-permit applications for the three Ecuadorians through the local “Oficina de Extranjería,” attaching their current employment contracts and my boss’s authorization letter.  
5. Arrange a toolbox‐talk with the Ecuadorian crew at noon: issue them proper PPE (hard hats, gloves, safety goggles), brief them on fall-protection zones, and assign them support roles (cutting wood for formwork, placing shims) under the subcontractor’s supervision.  
6. Supervise the new concrete foreman and the Ecuadorian crew side by side for the pour, record daily safety checklists, and take time-stamped photos of PPE and formwork inspections.  

By doing exactly this, I ensure the tank is poured by qualified hands on schedule, the three workers get safer, supervised duties, and I’ve opened the paperwork path to legalize their status—while keeping my boss’s deadline intact.
