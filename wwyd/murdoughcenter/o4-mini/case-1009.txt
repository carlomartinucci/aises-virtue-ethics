I would pick up the phone right now and call Barry Young’s office, ask for a 30-minute sit-down (or video call) this week, and in that meeting I would:  
1. Walk him through a revised invoice schedule that exactly matches his competitor’s “25% now, balance at 80% occupancy” ask—so that he can keep his cash flow plan intact.  
2. Show him line-by-line that nothing in our scope, drilling depths, lab testing or report deliverables has changed versus our original proposal—so he sees he isn’t giving anything up in quality or timing.  
3. Extend our drilling-contractor rate guarantee in writing, and add a clause that we’ll absorb any cost overrun on boring mobilization if occupancy drags past the 80% trigger date.  

After the meeting, I’d promptly email him the revised fee schedule, stamped “Revised Payment Terms Only – No Scope Changes,” and ask him to e-sign it by Friday so we can lock in the borings start date. That both neutralizes the competitor’s pitch and keeps the job—and its cash flow—running on our books.
