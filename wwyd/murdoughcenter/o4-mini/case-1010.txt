Julie’s next concrete step would be to turn her informal warning into a formal, binding supplement to the original survey.  Here’s exactly what she would do:

1. Draft “Supplemental Structural Memorandum No. 1” on her letterhead, addressed jointly to Charles A. Smith and Sam Goldworthy, attorney for the buyers.  In it she will:  
   • cite the original scope and date of delivery of the window-casement survey;  
   • summarize Brock Williams’s hands-on discovery that the granite-cladding clip angles are rusted through and that units are effectively unanchored;  
   • state—firmly, in professional engineering terms—that this condition creates an imminent risk of falling veneer;  
   • recommend, as an immediate safety precaution, erection of sidewalk protection scaffolding or netting beneath all seven floors of exterior granite;  
   • call for a non-destructive ultrasonic thickness survey of at least 10% of all support clips on every façade (to be carried out within five business days);  
   • reserve her firm’s rights under the original agreement to be compensated for the additional work.  

2. Sign and seal that supplement, and send it to Smith and Goldworthy by overnight courier with “Addressee Signature Required” plus an identical PDF by email, marked “URGENT – SAFETY SUPPLEMENT.”  

3. At the same time, place a copy of the Supplement in her firm’s permanent project files and send a memo to her office manager to open a change-order job number for “Inverness Block – Supplemental Safety Survey.”  

4. Within 24 hours of delivery, follow up with a phone call to Smith’s office and Goldworthy’s office to confirm receipt, reiterate the five-day window for the ultrasonic survey, and request scheduling of sidewalk-protection erection immediately upon board approval.  

By converting the oral warning into a formal, time-stamped supplement and insisting on specific mitigation—scaffolding/netting and a clip-thickness survey—Julie both protects the public, preserves her legal position, and forces the client to acknowledge and budget for the hazard before closing.
