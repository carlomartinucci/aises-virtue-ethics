1. Draft an email to the VP for Operations that reads roughly as follows (but typed in your firm’s normal style and letterhead):  
   “Subject: Time‐charging directive for Wellfleet work  
   Dear [VP Name],  
   I am writing to confirm our discussion today, in which you instructed the design team to record Wellfleet hours against the Excaliber budget. Because Wellfleet is on a separate contract with its own hourly‐rate billing, applying those hours to Excaliber would misstate both project costs. Please confirm in writing how you wish us to proceed. If you prefer, I can route this question to our Controller or to Legal for formal guidance.  
   Regards,  
   [Your Name]”  

2. Send that email immediately, copying your direct manager (if different from the VP), and the Controller or Finance lead on your firm’s organizational directory.

3. After sending, call or visit the Controller’s office with a print-out of your sent message and say:  
   “I just received a directive from [VP] to misallocate Wellfleet hours to Excaliber. I’ve asked for written confirmation and copied you per our internal policy. Please advise on next steps.”  

4. If you do not hear back from the VP or Controller within 24 hours, file a formal inquiry through your firm’s ethics hotline or compliance portal, attaching your email and any replies.  
5. Continue to record all hours accurately by project code without charging anything to Excaliber that was performed for Wellfleet, on the grounds that you have an open compliance question. If the VP insists verbally or in person, point back to your email trail and say you’re following accounting policy until Finance clarifies.  
6. Retain all meeting notes, emails, and time‐card entries in a secure folder labeled “Project-Accounting Inquiry – Wellfleet/Excaliber” so that, if necessary, your firm’s auditors or Legal team can trace exactly what you did and when.
