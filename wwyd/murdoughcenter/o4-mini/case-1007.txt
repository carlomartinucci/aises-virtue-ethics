I would take the following concrete steps:  
1. Gather documentary support.  • Pull public contract files from the university’s procurement office showing Shreud Contractors’ time‐and‐materials award for the stadium repairs (date awarded, line‐item budgets, invoices submitted).  
• Request copies of any change‐order authorizations or “surplus materials” memos that accompanied the lab‐facility project Ted mentioned.  
• Take dated photographs of Fred Facade’s house showing the Shreud truck and visible new framing.  
2. Prepare a concise summary packet.  • On one page, list each project (stadium, engineering lab, Vandergrafft garage, Facade remodel), the dates, the dollar amounts or material sources, and the insiders involved (Ray Vandergrafft, Fred Facade).  • Staple in photocopies of the contract award pages, material‐transfer memos and your photos.  
3. Schedule a meeting with the Vice President for Finance.  • Send a brief email to VP Finance (cc’ing you) requesting “a thirty-minute briefing” on “university contracting practices,” attaching your one-page summary.  • In the meeting, hand over the packet and ask whether the finance office has already reviewed these arrangements.  
4. Ask explicitly for a formal audit.  • If the VP says “no” or “I’m not aware,” request that the office open an independent audit or ethics‐compliance review of Shreud’s campus work and of any off-site work done for insiders.  
5. Follow up in writing.  • Within 48 hours of the meeting, send a memo to the VP Finance and to the University President (whose office you know), attaching your meeting notes and asking for confirmation of next steps (audit schedule, compliance-office contact).  

This sequence—document, summarize, meet, request audit, and confirm in writing—ensures you move from rumor and overheard conversation to hard evidence and triggers an official institutional review.
