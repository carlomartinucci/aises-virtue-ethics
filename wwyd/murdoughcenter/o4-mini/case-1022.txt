Question 1 – Setting your fee for Zeller Construction  
1. Review your standard time-and-materials rate sheet and note current hourly rates for yourself and any draftsmen or CAD operators you’ll assign.  For example:  
   • Principal engineer: \$180/hr  
   • Senior engineer: \$130/hr  
   • CAD technician: \$75/hr  
2. Identify the scope of work Zeller wants (e.g., prepare foundation falsework drawings, shop‐drawing checks, on‐site support).  Draft a task list with estimated hours for each:  
   • Initial site review and measurements – 8 hours  
   • Drafting revised falsework plans – 20 hours  
   • Structural calculations and checking – 15 hours  
   • Meetings and revisions – 5 hours  
3. Multiply estimated hours by the appropriate rates to arrive at a base labor fee.  Example:  
   • (8 h × \$180) + (20 h × \$130) + (15 h × \$180) + (5 h × \$130) = \$8,690  
4. Add direct expenses:  
   • Travel (mileage or flights): \$300  
   • Printing/reprographics: \$150  
   • Software license surcharge: \$200  
5. Apply your firm’s markup or overhead factor (typically 1.2× labor):  
   • \$8,690 labor × 1.2 = \$10,428  
6. Sum labor (with markup) plus expenses:  
   • \$10,428 + \$650 = \$11,078  
7. Round to a contract‐friendly number and include payment terms:  
   • Proposal fee: \$11,100 (50% due on notice to proceed, balance on final deliverables)  

Question 2 – Setting your fee if Hartwell contacts you  
1. Examine your original agreement with Hartwell to confirm ownership/licensing of the prior drawings. 2. Propose a license fee for reuse of your existing solution plus additional time for project re-contextualization:  
   • Base reuse license: \$5,000 (one-time)  
   • Update drawings & calculations for the new site: estimate 10 h principal + 15 h senior = (10×\$180)+(15×\$130) = \$3,150  
   • Meetings and coordination: 4 h × \$180 = \$720  
3. Add expenses as before (travel, printing, etc.) – estimate \$400.  
4. Add overhead factor or markup (× 1.2):  
   • Labor total (\$3,870) × 1.2 = \$4,644  
5. Total fee = reuse license (\$5,000) + labor w/markup (\$4,644) + expenses (\$400) = \$10,044.  Round to \$10,000 with a note: “includes license to reuse prior designs, updates, and coordination.”  

Question 3 – Does your decision change if Hartwell drops out?  
– No change to Zeller fee or Hartwell proposal.  Even if Hartwell isn’t bidding, you still:  
   • Have the same estimated hours and expense budget for Zeller.  
   • Charge Hartwell the same license fee and update fee if they engage you.  

If Hartwell doesn’t bid, you simply move forward with Zeller under the fee you quoted in Question 1.
