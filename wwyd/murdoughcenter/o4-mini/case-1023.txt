1. Pull the Moover–YourFirm engagement file and locate every piece of written correspondence or agreement (e-mails, letters, SOQ, exclusivity clause) that documents Moover’s promise to you as their sole structural subconsultant on the Fort Worth project.  
2. Draft and send a succinct, certified-mail “Demand for Performance and Payment” letter to I. B. Shaker and Chuck Cleaver that:  
   a. Cites the exclusivity arrangement in your SOQ and the guaranteed scope of work reflected in your $435,000 fee estimate;  
   b. Requests an immediate meeting (in Dallas or by video conference) within seven business days to:  
      – Finalize your subconsulting contract, including detailed deliverables and payment schedule; and  
      – Issue a formal purchase order or notice‐to‐proceed so you can mobilize your team.  
   c. Warns that, absent a timely response, you will consider your exclusivity arrangement breached and reserve all rights to seek recovery of lost profits and to notify the funding agency.  
3. Simultaneously, notify the Fort Worth funding‐agency procurement officer in writing (by e-mail and mail):  
   – Attach a copy of your SOQ pages naming your firm as the structural subconsultant and the exclusivity clause;  
   – Explain that Moover’s in-house group has assumed your promised work without any formal substitution or explanation;  
   – Ask the procurement officer to confirm whether Moover has submitted written notice of any change in subconsultant teams or scope, as required under their prime contract.  
4. If Shaker or Cleaver does not schedule the meeting within seven days, engage your in-house counsel (or outside litigation counsel) to prepare a breach-of-contract claim and advise on a possible protest to the funding agency.  
5. While steps 1–4 are in motion, have your business‐development lead draft an addendum to your firm’s SOQ for future projects that requires Moover (or any prime) to issue a signed subcontract or paid purchase order before your team begins work.
