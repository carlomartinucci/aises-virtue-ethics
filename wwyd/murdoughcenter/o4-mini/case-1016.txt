1. As President of Nearby Engineers  
   • I would call the County’s project manager by mid-day and say: “We received your request to submit a second proposal on this same scope. Because your staff already completed interviews and selected Trueheart, we believe the fair process was QBS followed by fee negotiation. To avoid any appearance of unfairness or waste of resources on all sides, we respectfully decline to submit an additional proposal.”  
   • I would follow up in writing (email) confirming we will not propose, and asking whether the County intends to rebid the RFP with a new, transparent selection schedule.  

2. As the County Public Works engineer on the interview/selection team  
   • I would send a private, dated memo to the Director of Public Works stating: “I object to reopening proposals after our QBS interviews. This breaches the RFP and the State’s consultant selection rules. Please advise whether you will honor the committee’s ranking. If not, I request that you bring this change to the Board in open session and allow formal public comment or rebidding.”  
   • Simultaneously, I would copy that memo to the County’s legal counsel and to the County Administrative Officer, flagging that the RFP’s terms have been altered midstream.  

3. As the Director of Public Works  
   • I would reply to the Board member who instructed me in writing: “I cannot legally award the work to Nearby Engineers without reopening the RFP to all qualified firms or running a new QBS process. State law requires qualifications‐based selection for engineering services. Please let me know if you would like me to schedule a new RFP or to proceed with our original recommendation of Trueheart.”  
   • I would also prepare a brief staff report for the next Board meeting outlining the original QBS process, our selection of Trueheart, and the legal requirement to maintain QBS integrity—so that the Board makes an informed, public vote.  

4. As President of Trueheart Engineers  
   • I would send a certified letter to the County Purchasing Director detailing the hours and tasks my team logged after selection (scope refinement, contract redlines, fee structure) and request either (a) a sole‐source “start‐up” contract for that work or (b) a direct reimbursement of $X for work performed under the County’s implied authorization.  
   • If I receive no response within 14 days, I would file a formal protest under the County’s procurement code and, if necessary, refer the matter to the California Architects & Engineers Joint Committee for dispute resolution.
