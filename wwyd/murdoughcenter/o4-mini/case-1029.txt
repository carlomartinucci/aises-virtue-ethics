1. Call a meeting with Human Resources and Finance by the end of this week to draft a “phased‐retirement/transition” arrangement for Eleanor.  In that meeting I will:  
   • Propose reducing her hours from 40 to 20 per week, reclassifying her title from “Executive Secretary” to “Receptionist (part‐time),” and prorating her salary accordingly.  
   • Insist that her existing health insurance coverage continue unchanged until she qualifies for her pension.  
   • Outline a clear, written task list for her new role—answering phones, greeting vendors, filing—and transfer all remaining executive‐secretary duties to Pauline or another assistant.  
   • Identify the exact date this change would take effect (e.g., 30 days after Eleanor’s written consent) so HR can process pay and benefit amendments.  

2. Within two business days after that meeting, schedule a one‐on‐one with Eleanor to present the package:  
   • Show her the new 20‐hour job description in writing.  
   • Explain that her salary and benefits will be adjusted but that she will keep full health coverage until pension eligibility.  
   • Give her a written agreement and two weeks to review and sign.  

3. Submit the signed agreement to HR immediately, so payroll and benefits can be updated without a gap.  

4. Over the next month, hold weekly check‐ins with Eleanor to ensure she’s comfortable in her new duties, and with Pauline to confirm the executive‐secretary tasks are fully covered.  

5. Document every step (meeting notes, signed agreements, updated job descriptions) in Eleanor’s personnel file to protect the city’s merit‐system obligations and ensure transparency to auditors or the City Council.
