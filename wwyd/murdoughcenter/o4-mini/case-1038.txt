1. Immediately pause the land‐acquisition process  
   – I pick up the phone and call Conner: “Do not sign or fund any closings today. Hold all paperwork until further notice.”  

2. Pull and review public records to confirm the joint venture’s property interest  
   – I open the county parcel database for Walbert Township, pull the deeds and tax filings for the out‐parcel in question, and print the legal description and chain of title.  

3. Assemble a binding facts memo for ClearWater’s legal counsel  
   – In Word, I draft a two‐page memo with (a) date of plat, (b) identification of EA/SM ownership, (c) timeline of their design recommendation, and (d) my instructions to pause closing. I email the memo to our general counsel and cc my VP.  

4. Schedule an immediate in‐person meeting with Elias Auften and Shellie Moore  
   – I email them: “Please join me tomorrow at 9 AM in Conference Room B. Agenda: ‘Design conflict and land‐ownership disclosure.’”  

5. Confront them with the evidence and demand remediation  
   – In the meeting I lay out:  
     • “I have public deeds showing your joint venture holds title to Parcel X.”  
     • “You recommended the road alignment that directly boosts the value of Parcel X.”  
     • “You never disclosed this to me, to Murray or Walbert Township.”  
   – I demand they:  
     a) Provide a signed written disclosure of their property interest within 24 hours, addressed to Walbert Township and to ClearWater.  
     b) Transfer the parcel to an independent trustee (or sell it back) within 10 business days; alternatively, resign from any further design or municipal‐engineering services on this project.  

6. Notify Walbert Township officials and secure an independent peer review  
   – After receiving their disclosure, I send a certified letter to the Walbert Township Board of Supervisors attaching their written statement. I also hire a third‐party civil engineering firm with no ties to either town to peer‐review the road alignment and confirm its technical merits.  

7. Reassign design and oversight roles to eliminate the conflict  
   – I send an internal project‐team email: “Effective immediately, all design changes on the Walbert Road must be processed through [new firm], with Elias/Shellie excluded from any decisions or signatures. Conner: resume closings only once I confirm the chain of title is clear.”  

8. Document every step for ClearWater’s project file  
   – I file in the project folder: the hold notice to Conner, the county deed printouts, the legal memo, the meeting minutes with EA/SM (signed by all), their disclosure letter, the certified mailing receipt to Walbert Township, and the contract amendment naming the new engineer.  

By these concrete actions—pausing the purchase, confronting the JV with documentation, forcing immediate written disclosure and either divestiture or removal, notifying the township, and appointing an independent reviewer—I both protect ClearWater’s legal position and remove the undisclosed‐interest conflict from the project.
