1. Pull up the DOT Utility Accommodation policy (Chapter 6, Section 2 of the Design Manual) and highlight the clause that says only “unavoidable utility conflicts” may be paid by the State.  
2. On my computer draft a short memo to Warren, titled “Shadyvale Water Main – Policy Clarification.” In it I will:  
   a. Quote the exact policy language.  
   b. State that our 30%‐level alignment avoids the water main and therefore triggers “betterment” status under policy.  
   c. Ask whether he wants a formal “betterment request” package submitted by the Town or if we are to proceed with the avoidance alignment.  
3. Attach to that memo the cost estimate comparison (showing $350K full replacement vs. $25K incremental cost).  
4. Send the memo by e-mail to Warren, copying my section supervisor and the DOT Utilities Coordinator. Request a written decision by the end of the week so I can finalize the 60% design without ambiguity.  
5. File a record of that e-mail and policy reference in our project folder so that any subsequent reviewer can see that I sought explicit direction rather than unilaterally bending policy.
