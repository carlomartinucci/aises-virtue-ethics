1. Go immediately to the Everclere field-lab trailer and secure the ice chest containing the two drum samples. Lock it in the lab’s evidence cabinet under my key control.  
2. Pull out my field notebook and write a new entry, dated today, describing Chuck’s instructions, the verbal “no further action” message, and the subsequent bona fide observation of the drums being removed for “clean fill.” Photocopy the field note page and slip the copy into the project’s paper file.  
3. Call the on-site analytical chemistry lab and schedule same-day hazardous-waste testing on those two samples, specifying the full suite of TCLP (Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure) metals and volatile organic compounds.  In that call record I’ll note date, time, person spoken to, and turnaround time promised.  
4. Prepare a new chain-of-custody (COC) form: document sample IDs, date/time of relinquishment (now), my signature as “deliverer,” and lab courier’s name and signature as “receiver.”  Scan the signed COC into the Everclere project folder.  
5. Package the samples in the lab’s standard shipping cooler, attach the completed COC, and dispatch via the lab’s scheduled courier pickup this afternoon. Photograph the sealed cooler and COC label for my records and insert the photo into the project file.  
6. Draft a brief memo to Chuck: “Per our last conversation and in light of recent unauthorized drum removal, I have dispatched the original samples to our accredited lab under COC #ECL-20240529-01.  I’ll forward results immediately upon receipt.”  Email it to Chuck with read-receipt requested.  
7. Set a calendar reminder for the laboratory turnaround date.  When results arrive, review them; if they confirm hazardous waste, prepare a Compliance Notification to the client and to the state environmental regulator under Everclere’s incident-reporting protocol. Then schedule a phone call with Chuck and the client to discuss next steps.
