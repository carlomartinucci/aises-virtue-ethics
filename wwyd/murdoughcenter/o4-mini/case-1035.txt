Tomorrow morning I would pull up my geotechnical report, open my CAD soil-bearing sketch, and draft a one-page cost-comparison for the remaining barns showing:  
  • The volume of concrete and tonnage of rebar in the current foundation plan versus the volume and tonnage that would meet the report’s footer recommendations  
  • Estimated material and labor savings for each barn (e.g., 30% less concrete, 25% less steel)  
Then I would email that one-pager to Walker with a brief note:  
“Good morning, Walker. Attached is a side-by-side comparison of the foundations you’re about to pour versus the lightly reinforced footings my report established. You’ll see a substantial savings in material and labor on the next four barns. Let’s meet on site Thursday at 10:00 am to walk through these numbers together. If your structural designer (Chuck or Larry) can join us, we can nail down a revised foundation section that still meets all performance criteria. Please let me know if 10 am works.”  
That concrete, data-driven deliverable and on-site meeting request is a specific, actionable step to bring their design team back in alignment with the geotech findings before more wasteful work gets built.
