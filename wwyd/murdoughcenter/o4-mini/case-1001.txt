I would immediately partner with a locally licensed professional engineer to take legal responsibility for the remediation design, then re-submit the stamped drawings and calculations under that PE’s seal.  Steps:

1.  Phone a respected, local structural or geotechnical PE (for example, I’ll call “Smith & Associates, P.E.”) and explain the tower‐stabilization design that was executed without a state license.  
2.  Send Smith & Associates all of my original calculations, drawings, soil reports, monitoring logs and correspondence with Holdem and Stout.  
3.  Draft and sign a short “subconsultant agreement” in which I transfer professional liability for the clock‐tower work to Smith & Associates.  Smith & Associates will:  
    a. Review and, if necessary, correct or augment the design.  
    b. Stamp and seal the final drawings and computations.  
4.  Overnight the sealed documents to the town building department and the state Board of Registration, with a cover letter saying “Please accept these sealed drawings as the official record for the clock‐tower remediation.  I have engaged a licensed local PE to assume full responsibility.”  
5.  Send Stout a copy of that cover letter and the sealed plans, plus an offer to reimburse him pro-rata for any legal or administrative costs he may incur.  
6.  In parallel, file a “Letter of Explanation” with the state Board outlining the emergency conditions, the immediate need for stabilization, and the fact that I have now secured a local PE’s seal.  

By doing this:  
– The state—and Stout—see that a licensed engineer is now on record.  
– I have transferred liability for the design to someone who holds a valid state license.  
– I’ve created a documented paper trail showing good faith and cooperation.
