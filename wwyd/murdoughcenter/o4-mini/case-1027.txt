I would prepare and send Bill Broot a firm‐fixed‐fee proposal of $25,000 for the new, adjacent site, along with a very tight scope‐of‐work and change‐order process. Specifically, tomorrow morning I would:

1. Email Bill my proposal memo, headed “New Cluster Site Civil Design – Fee Proposal,” that says:  
   - “Base fee: $22,800 (credit applied for reuse of Dawson Enterprises data and analyses)”  
   - “Standard overhead and profit markup: 9.6% ($2,200)”  
   - “TOTAL FIRM‐FIXED FEE: $25,000”

2. Attach a one‐page scope exhibit that:  
   - Lists the tasks included (road layout, drainage design, earthwork, paving, wastewater disposal) and explicitly states that all “Additional Services” (e.g. structural wall design, environmental studies beyond existing survey, nighttime traffic control plans, utility relocations) require a written change order before work begins.  
   - Commits to deliver 50% of preliminary drawings within three weeks of notice to proceed, final plans within six weeks, and two review cycles, all for the fixed $25,000.

3. Request Bill’s signed approval of the attached fee letter and scope exhibit by the end of the week before our team commits staff.  

By quoting $25,000 I:  
- Recoup part of the Dawson overrun without underselling the new work;  
- Maintain a competitive discount relative to the full $31,700 rate;  
- Insist on a clear change‐order process to prevent future scope creep.
