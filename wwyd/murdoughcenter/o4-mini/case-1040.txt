1. Pull up the approved submittal log and the original functional requirements from EDOT. Highlight the exact components Marc authorized that differ from what was specified or what we engineered (model numbers, performance specs, vendor data sheets).  
2. Draft a Formal Non-Conformance Report (NCR) on Tecxtrans letterhead, citing:  
   – Contract document and section number for the original hardware specification  
   – Actual hardware installed or proposed by the subcontractor  
   – Specific performance shortfall (e.g., “Installed Model X has only 80 Mb/s throughput versus the 100 Mb/s minimum required by Section 2.3.1 of the Functional Requirements.”)  
3. Send that NCR by e-mail (cc’ing Marc Stanton as JV Managing Partner and the subcontractor’s project manager) and allow 48 hours for a corrective-action plan.  
4. In the same e-mail, request a joint design-build change-control meeting with Marc, the subcontractor rep, our project control manager, and the EDOT Resident Engineer. Propose an agenda: review NCR, evaluate substitution alternatives, agree on cost/time implications, and document action items.  
5. At the meeting:  
   a. Read the NCR aloud, confirm understanding.  
   b. Ask the subcontractor to present a remediation plan (either revert to the approved hardware or submit performance data for an equal-or-better device).  
   c. Capture any cost or schedule impacts on a “D/B Change Proposal” form.  
   d. Obtain signatures from Marc, the subcontractor PM, our QC lead, and the EDOT Resident Engineer on that form.  
6. If Marc or the subcontractor refuse to correct the non-conformance within the 48-hour window, immediately transmit the signed Change Proposal to EDOT’s Contract Manager with a cover memo stating: “Per Section 5.4 of the Design-Build Agreement, please advise whether to proceed with corrective substitution or process an official Contract Modification.”  Attach the original NCR and meeting minutes.  
7. File all correspondence, meeting notes, and signed forms in the Tecxtrans Project ECM (document control) under folder “Change Control > Non-Conformance Reports.”  That ensures an audit trail so EDOT can later see we raised the issue promptly and formally.
