Sam picks up the phone first thing Monday morning and calls In-Line’s outside CPA, Jane Torres at Midstate Accounting. He says:  
“Jane, I need you in our office Tuesday at 8 AM. Bring your laptop and all workpapers on our ESOP trust and our monthly financials for the last 12 months. I want a full, in-depth review of cash flow, backlog, receivables, payables, ESOP‐reserve balances, insurance trusts and our E&O escrow. No glossing over: I want line-item backup, variance explanations, and a clear statement of how much operating cash we actually have on hand and where the real liabilities lie.”  

He then immediately sends Jane a calendar invite labeled “Urgent: ESOP Trustee Prep” and copies Cal Culator on the meeting notice. He includes the CPA engagement letter attachment that outlines her scope:  
• Reconcile all ESOP‐related loans and reserves  
• Confirm status of health‐insurance escrow  
• Detail E&O premium catch‐up needed to reinstate coverage  
• Identify any off-balance‐sheet liabilities  
• Produce a clean set of P&L and balance sheets signed by Jane for distribution to the ESOP trustee by Friday  

By Tuesday at 8 AM, Sam—and now Cal—sit down with Jane Torres. Sam instructs her point-by-point to assemble the unvarnished figures, so that when they meet the ESOP trustee later in the week, they have an airtight, transparent package. That way any attempt to raid the ESOP, cancel insurance, misstate backlog, or defer payables will be exposed immediately—and Sam will have concrete, date-stamped documentation to block Max’s “transition plan.”
