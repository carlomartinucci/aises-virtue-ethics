On the next Friday afternoon, at about 3:30 p.m., I would do the following concrete steps:  
1. Take out my phone and photograph the contractor’s foreman placing the item (e.g. box of tires, bike, whiskey, shotgun) in Resident Engineer Upwright’s truck bed. Make sure the timestamp is visible.  
2. Remain on-site until Upwright drives off, so I can note the license-plate number of his pickup truck.  
3. The following Monday morning at 8:30 a.m., draft an email to Eth Hicks (Upwright’s direct supervisor) with this exact subject line: “Gift Transfers to RE Upwright—Documentation and Request for Guidance.”  
4. In the body of the email, I would list:  
   • date and time of observation (e.g. “Friday, July 10, 3:27 p.m.”)  
   • exact location on the site (e.g. “north end of pier B construction”)  
   • contractor name and foreman’s name  
   • pickup truck make, model, and license plate  
   • attach the timestamped photographs.  
5. Ask for explicit instructions on how to proceed in the DOT’s internal investigations or gift-reporting process.  
6. Send the email and then save copies of my photos and notes in a dedicated “DOT Gifts Audit” folder on my state-issued laptop, timestamped and backed up to the state server.
