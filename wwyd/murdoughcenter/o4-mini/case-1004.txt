1. Gather evidence  
   a. Order a certified copy of the conference hotel registry showing “Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert” as co-occupants.  
   b. Obtain sworn statements from the engineer in Cleghorn’s office confirming he and Cuthbert have been cohabiting since the case began.  
   c. Secure public records (divorce decree for Cuthbert; separation affidavit for Cleghorn) to establish their marital statuses.  

2. Prepare a motion to disqualify Cleghorn (or strike his testimony) for non-disclosure of the personal relationship with opposing counsel, relying on the court’s inherent authority to guard against conflicts that threaten trial fairness.  
   a. Draft a “Motion to Preclude Expert Testimony of Clyde Cleghorn” under the applicable rule (e.g., New Jersey Court Rule 1:12-3 or Federal Rule 26(b)(4)(E) if in federal court), attaching:  
      – Exhibit A: Hotel registry  
      – Exhibit B: Sworn statement from Cleghorn’s colleague  
      – Exhibit C: Certified copies of divorce/separation filings  
   b. In the accompanying brief, argue that Cleghorn’s failure to disclose a cohabiting personal relationship with opposing counsel undermines his impartiality and warrants exclusion of his expert opinions.  

3. File and serve the motion  
   a. File the motion and exhibits with the clerk.  
   b. Serve copies on Xernon, Young & Zimmer (Cuthbert’s firm) and opposing counsel of record.  

4. Notify Fulton Adams and the insurance carrier  
   a. Deliver the motion papers and a concise memo explaining your grounds for seeking exclusion.  
   b. Recommend they press for an expedited hearing so the court can rule before expert-related trial deadlines.  

5. Prepare for the hearing  
   a. Assemble your affidavits and be ready to testify to how you obtained the evidence.  
   b. Outline cross-examination points to show why Cleghorn’s opinions are now tainted by his undisclosed relationship.
