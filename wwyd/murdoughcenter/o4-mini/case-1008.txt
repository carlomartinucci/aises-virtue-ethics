1. Secure and preserve evidence of the tampering immediately.  Walk back to the monitoring-well array with a digital camera and GPS-enabled smartphone.  Photograph each well cap, the wet pavement, Klene’s hose, any fingerprints or footprints around the wellheads.  Record the date, time, and exact GPS coordinates for each photo.  Label and timestamp all images.  
2. Retrieve a fresh set of groundwater samples from the same monitoring wells before any further dilution can occur.  Call two field technicians, have them meet you on-site within the hour.  Supervise them personally: unlock each well cap, measure and record water level, purge the well according to your standard operating procedure (three well volumes), then collect split samples in pre-cleaned, pre-labeled glassware.  Seal, label, and chain-of-custody the bottles.  Store them on ice and ship an express courier to your accredited lab with instructions for the same analytical suite used originally.  
3. Notify your technical director and legal department by email and follow up with a five-minute in-person briefing.  Attach the timestamped photos and a five-line summary: “I observed Klene personally diluting wells on [date/time].  This invalidates our data set.  We have just re-sampled 10 wells, sent split samples to ACL Lab, and taken custody.  Recommend postponing regulatory presentation.”  
4. Instruct your project engineer to draft a corrected technical memorandum.  Outline the problem (illegal dilution), list the new field procedures, present an amended sampling schedule, and propose revised interim conclusions based on the re-sampled data.  Set a deliverable deadline for end of day tomorrow so you have two full days to review before the regulated-agency meeting.  
5. Contact the state regulatory project officer by phone and say: “Enviroconcern has discovered evidence of tampering with the monitoring wells by the site owner.  We are re-sampling under chain of custody and will submit corrected analytical results no later than two business days before the scheduled presentation.”  Offer to postpone the meeting if they prefer.  
6. Secure the on-site well caps with your own tamper-evident seals.  Install numbered plastic security seals that will break if anyone reopens the wells.  Record the seal numbers in your field log and photograph them in place.  
7. Document every step thoroughly in your firm’s internal project file: field notes, chain-of-custody records, lab submittals, emails to management and regulators, photographs of seals.  Keep a printed backup in your locked office.
