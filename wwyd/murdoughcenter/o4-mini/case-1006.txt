1. That afternoon, I’ll pull up my calendar and schedule a 15-minute one-on-one with Charlie Oxx for 10 a.m. tomorrow. In the meeting request I’ll write: “Charlie—could we meet to clarify today’s discussion about campaign contributions?” so there’s a paper trail.  
2. In that meeting, I’ll say: “Charlie, I’m committed to doing great work at CWE. I’m uncomfortable with the implication that I must give $1,000 to public-official campaigns. Can you point me to the company policy that requires political contributions?”  I’ll take notes on his exact wording.  
3. If Charlie points to an unwritten expectation or dodges the question, I’ll follow up immediately—by 3 p.m. tomorrow—via e-mail to both Charlie and HR (hr@civilworkseng.com). My draft will be:  
   “Charlie, per our conversation this morning, you indicated that employees ‘must’ contribute campaign funds to city-council members who influence our contracts. I have no record of such a policy.  Please confirm in writing whether CWE requires political donations by staff. Thank you, [My Name].”  
4. I’ll copy the e-mail to CWE’s HR manager, so HR is officially aware.  
5. If I don’t get a written policy by end of week, I’ll reply to that thread: “Since I have no formal directive or policy on this, I will not be making any political contributions as a condition of employment.”  I’ll send that by Friday 5 p.m.  
6. Simultaneously, I’ll prepare a brief memo for my personal file summarizing dates, times, participants, and Charlie’s statements. I’ll save copies of all correspondence.  
7. If Charlie or my manager later criticizes me or threatens my job, I’ll forward this entire e-mail chain to CWE’s ethics hotline (ethics@civilworkseng.com) and request an investigation. I’ll also ask for contact information for outside counsel or the city ethics commission, in case further steps are needed.
