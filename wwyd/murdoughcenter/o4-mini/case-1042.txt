1. Return to the site at first light with my clipboard, camera phone, and the project drawings in hand.  Walk the affected steel bay and:  
   a. Take clear, timestamped photos of every beam face that will be concealed by walls—showing uncoated and coated areas side by side.  
   b. Mark each beam location on the sheet of project drawings, noting any spots I cannot access for coating inspection.  

2. Open our project management system (we use Procore) and create a “Non-Conformance Report.” In that report I will:  
   a. Attach the photos and annotated drawings.  
   b. Quote the exact spec section requiring full-surface coating on all exposed and subsequently concealed steel.  
   c. Describe the risk (possible future corrosion in hidden areas).  

3. Email that NCR to:  
   – Gibb (coating subcontractor superintendent)  
   – Riley (my boss)  
   – Janis (building inspector)  
   – Our QA/QC manager  
   In the email I will request written confirmation from Gibb within 24 hours of how and when he plans to re-coat the hidden areas.

4. Immediately flag the coating subcontractor’s pending payment application in Procore as “Pending QA Resolution” so that Riley cannot inadvertently approve payment until the non-conformance is closed.

5. Follow up at the 24-hour mark:  
   – If Gibb responds with a repair schedule, visit the site on the appointed day, witness the re-coating, photograph the work, and formally close the NCR in Procore.  
   – If Gibb does not respond or misses his schedule, escalate by calling a brief meeting with Riley and QA/QC, present the open NCR and photos, and request a joint site walk to decide next steps (e.g., withholding retainage or assigning a remedial crew at Rome Builders’ cost).
