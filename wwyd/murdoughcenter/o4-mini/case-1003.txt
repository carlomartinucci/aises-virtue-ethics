I’m both encouraged (each of the four firms liked my background and interview answers) and a little anxious about timing—my spouse’s transfer hinges on my landing a job there. Here’s exactly what I’d do next:

1. That afternoon, I’d sit down and draft four separate thank-you emails—one to each interviewer—calling out a specific moment from our discussion (for example, “I enjoyed our deep dive on your new bridge-retrofit standards”). I’d hit “send” within 24 hours of each interview.

2. In each email I’d also write, “Because my spouse’s transfer is scheduled for June 1, I’m hoping to finalize my next steps by May 15. Please let me know your anticipated timeline for a decision or if there’s any additional information I can provide.”

3. I’d calendar a reminder for exactly one week after I send those emails. On that day, I’d follow up with a brief, polite phone call to the HR contact or hiring manager—something like, “Hi, this is [Name]. I just wanted to check whether I can provide any further materials or clarifications to help you decide.”

4. I’d simultaneously pull together a one-page comparison sheet listing each firm’s salary, benefits, start date flexibility, and any relocation assistance. That way, when offers land I can immediately see which one aligns best with our moving window.

5. Finally, I’d inform my current employer of this concrete timeline (May 15) so they know when I’ll be ready to hand over my projects and book my relocation logistics once an offer is in hand.
