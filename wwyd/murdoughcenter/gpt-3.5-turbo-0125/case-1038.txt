Daulton should immediately schedule a meeting with Elias and Shellie to address the situation. During the meeting, he should confront them about their failure to disclose their ownership of the property that stands to benefit from the construction of the new road. Daulton should express his disappointment in their lack of transparency and emphasize the ethical implications of their actions.

Daulton should make it clear to Elias and Shellie that their behavior is unacceptable and could have serious consequences for ClearWater Developers if it were to be discovered. He should demand that they rectify the situation by either divesting themselves of the property or taking steps to mitigate any potential conflicts of interest.

Additionally, Daulton should inform Conner about the situation and ensure that he is aware of the conflict of interest involving Elias and Shellie. Conner should be instructed to proceed with caution in the negotiations for the property acquisition and to seek legal advice if necessary.

Daulton should document the meeting with Elias and Shellie, as well as any subsequent actions taken to address the conflict of interest. He should also consider seeking guidance from ClearWater Developers' legal department or an external ethics committee to ensure that the situation is handled appropriately and in accordance with ethical standards.
