I would advise Julie to prioritize the safety of the public and the integrity of her work. She should immediately contact the local building authorities to report the structural issues with the Inverness Block, specifically the rusted clip angles that pose a serious risk of the granite veneer blocks becoming dislodged and potentially causing harm to pedestrians below. Julie should provide all the information she has, including Brock's findings and the details of the situation.

Additionally, Julie should inform her client, Charles Smith, in writing about the structural concerns and the potential risks associated with the building. She should make it clear that she cannot proceed with any further work on the building until the safety issues are addressed. Julie should also seek legal advice to understand her obligations and potential liabilities in this situation.

It is crucial for Julie to prioritize safety and ethical standards in her profession, even if it means risking her business relationship with Smith. By taking proactive steps to address the structural issues, Julie can demonstrate her commitment to professional integrity and public safety.
