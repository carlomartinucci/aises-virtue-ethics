Arthur and David should respond by taking the following specific actions:

1. Arthur and David should immediately disclose the potential conflict of interest to the Fairview CSC and any other relevant parties involved in the project, including the major design firm seeking their partnership.

2. They should seek guidance from legal counsel or an ethics advisor to ensure they fully understand the implications of the conflict of interest and the potential consequences for their firm and reputation.

3. Arthur and David should consider recusing themselves from any involvement in the project that could be perceived as a conflict of interest, even if they have publicly stated their intention to abstain from deliberations about awarding contracts.

4. They should engage in open and transparent communication with Monroe and address his concerns directly, demonstrating a commitment to ethical behavior and professional integrity.

5. Arthur and David should work with the Fairview CSC and other stakeholders to establish clear guidelines and procedures for handling conflicts of interest in future projects to prevent similar issues from arising.
