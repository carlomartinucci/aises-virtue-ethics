I would express my disappointment to Mr. Young for not informing me about his decision to work with a competitor after I had put effort into preparing the detailed scope of work and submitting a proposal. I would also remind him of the value of the work I had outlined in the proposal and how it aligns with the project's needs.

Next, I would inquire if there is any possibility to revisit the agreement and have my firm involved in the project, highlighting the expertise and experience my firm offers in this specific area. If Mr. Young is open to discussion, I would negotiate terms that could potentially allow my firm to be part of the project, ensuring a fair and mutually beneficial arrangement.

If Mr. Young is firm in his decision to proceed with the competitor, I would thank him for considering my proposal and express interest in future opportunities to work together. I would also take this as a learning experience to improve my communication and follow-up strategies in future interactions with clients.
