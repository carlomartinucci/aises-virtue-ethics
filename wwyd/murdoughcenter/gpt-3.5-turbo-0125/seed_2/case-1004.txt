I would inform Fulton Adams of the observed relationship between Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert, as it could potentially raise concerns about bias or conflicts of interest in Cleghorn's role as an engineering consultant and expert witness for Kinkora Developments. This information may be relevant to the ongoing legal proceedings, as it could impact the credibility and impartiality of Cleghorn's testimony. It would be important to ensure that all parties involved in the case are aware of this potential conflict so that they can make informed decisions moving forward.
