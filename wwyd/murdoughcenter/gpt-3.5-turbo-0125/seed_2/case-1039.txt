Shariq should immediately contact his supervisor, Chuck Ashby, and inform him that the drums have not been tested for hazardous material as claimed by the crew from his former employer. He should provide Chuck with all the details of his observations and the situation regarding the samples he collected. Shariq should emphasize the importance of addressing this discrepancy to ensure proper handling and disposal of the drums in accordance with regulations. Additionally, he should offer to provide the samples he collected for testing to verify the contents of the drums and take appropriate action based on the results.
