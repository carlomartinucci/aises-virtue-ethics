Question 1:
As the President of Nearby Engineers, I feel conflicted about submitting an additional proposal when I know that Trueheart Engineers have already been selected for the project by the Public Works staff. However, since the County Public Works Department has requested a formal proposal from us, I would proceed with submitting the proposal in accordance with the request. I would ensure that our proposal is thorough, competitive, and in compliance with the requirements outlined in the request.

Question 2:
As a professional engineer on the County Public Works Department staff and a member of the interview/selection team for this project, I would express my concerns about the deviation from the announced QBS selection process and the Director of Public Works overturning the professional evaluation of the proposed consultants. I would document my objections and bring them to the attention of the appropriate authorities within the department or the County Board of Supervisors if necessary. I would uphold the principles of fairness, transparency, and integrity in the selection process.

Question 3:
As the Director of Public Works, I have a responsibility to act in the best interests of the County and adhere to the established procedures for consultant selection. Despite being instructed by a member of the Board of Supervisors to hire Nearby Engineers regardless of the announced QBS selection procedure, I would uphold the integrity of the process and ensure that the selection is based on qualifications, experience, and fairness. I would communicate with the Board of Supervisors about the importance of following proper procedures and advocate for the selection of consultants based on merit.

Question 4:
As the President of Trueheart Engineers, I would first seek clarification from the County Public Works Department about the status of the project and the reasons for the delay in contract approval. If it becomes apparent that the selection process has been compromised, I would consider raising my concerns with the appropriate authorities within the department or the County Board of Supervisors. I would also evaluate the potential impact on our firm and explore all available options to address the situation professionally and ethically.
