In the morning, I would inform Bill Broot that the cost estimate for the new project directly adjacent to the Dawson Enterprises site would be $22,800. I would emphasize that this estimate takes into account the reuse of information and analyses gathered for the Dawson site, which allows for a more cost-effective approach for the new project. Additionally, I would clarify the scope of work covered by this amount to ensure transparency and alignment with the client's expectations.
