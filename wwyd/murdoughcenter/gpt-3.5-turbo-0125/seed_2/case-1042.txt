I would advise Rashid to document the issue regarding the inaccessible portions of the steel beams and the potential problem with the coating procedure. He should take detailed notes, including dates, observations, and any relevant specifications that support his concerns. Rashid should also gather any evidence available, such as photographs or diagrams, to clearly illustrate the problem.

Next, I would recommend Rashid raise his concerns with his immediate supervisor, Riley, in a formal manner. He should request a meeting with Riley to discuss the issue and present his documented findings. Rashid should express his concerns about the quality of the work and the potential safety implications of the incomplete coating on the steel beams.

During the meeting with Riley, Rashid should remain calm and professional, presenting his case logically and clearly. He should emphasize that his primary concern is the quality and safety of the project, as well as the reputation of Rome Builders Inc. Rashid should also be prepared to provide possible solutions or suggestions for addressing the problem, such as involving the subcontractor in rectifying the issue.

If Riley dismisses his concerns or refuses to take action, Rashid should consider escalating the issue to higher management within the company or even contacting the relevant authorities or building inspectors directly. Rashid should prioritize public safety and ethical considerations over potential conflicts with his superiors.
