I would immediately document all communications and interactions with Moover Design Consultants, including the initial request to join their team, the agreement made regarding the exclusive arrangement, the scope of work submitted, and the subsequent lack of communication from Moover.

Next, I would request a meeting with Moover Design Consultants to discuss the status of the project and clarify the role of my firm in the design process. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about the lack of communication and the discrepancy between the initial agreement and the current situation. I would seek clarification on the extent of our involvement moving forward and address any issues related to the project's progress and our role in it.

If the meeting with Moover does not provide satisfactory answers or resolutions to the issues raised, I would consider seeking legal advice to understand my firm's rights and options in the situation. This may involve reviewing the terms of the contract, assessing potential breaches, and exploring avenues for recourse if necessary.

Overall, my main objective would be to ensure transparency, uphold the integrity of my firm, and protect our interests in the project.
