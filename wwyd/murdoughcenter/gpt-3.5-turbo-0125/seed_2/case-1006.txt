I would first seek clarification from Charlie Oxx regarding the expectations for employee contributions to the council members' campaign funds. I would express my willingness to support the firm's relationships with the council members but also inquire about alternative ways to demonstrate loyalty that align with my personal values and financial constraints.

If Charlie Oxx insists on a direct financial contribution, I would consider discussing the situation with a trusted mentor or colleague within the company to gain perspective on how such requests have been handled in the past. I would also review the company's code of conduct and policies to understand if there are any guidelines related to political contributions.

Ultimately, I would make a decision based on my ethical principles and the potential impact on my career at CWE. I would weigh the importance of maintaining integrity and ethical behavior against the potential consequences of not complying with the request for contributions.
