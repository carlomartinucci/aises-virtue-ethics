I would advise Turnbuckle to gather all documentation related to his engineering work on the clock tower remediation project, including his design plans, correspondence with the various parties involved, and any other relevant information. He should then schedule a meeting with the state Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors to present his case and explain the circumstances that led to him practicing engineering without a license in the state. Turnbuckle should be prepared to demonstrate his qualifications, experience, and the urgent nature of the situation that required his immediate intervention to save the clock tower. Additionally, he should be transparent about his efforts to obtain a temporary license and provide evidence of his acceptance by the Board through reciprocity after the completion of the project. By being proactive, cooperative, and transparent with the Board, Turnbuckle can work towards resolving the complaint filed by Stout and potentially avoid legal action.
