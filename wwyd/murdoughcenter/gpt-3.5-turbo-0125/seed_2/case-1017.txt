Bert should gather all relevant evidence, such as the original drawings from his previous job at County Line Design that he suspects were copied, any communication or contracts between County Line Design and Far Horizons Engineering regarding the use of these drawings, and any other documentation that supports his suspicions. He should then schedule a meeting with his supervisor or a higher authority within Far Horizons Engineering to present his findings and express his concerns about potential intellectual property infringement. During the meeting, Bert should remain professional and objective, focusing on the facts and maintaining a respectful demeanor. He should propose a solution, such as investigating the origin of the drawings and rectifying any unauthorized use if confirmed. Bert should also be prepared to take further steps, such as involving legal counsel if necessary, to protect the intellectual property rights of his former employer and uphold professional ethics in his current workplace.
