Robert should document his concerns and observations about the over-designed foundation and the construction issues encountered during the site visit. He should prepare a detailed report outlining the discrepancies between his geotechnical recommendations and the actual construction, emphasizing the potential risks and inefficiencies resulting from the current approach. Robert should then schedule a meeting with Walker, Larry, and any other relevant parties to discuss his findings and recommendations for corrective actions to ensure the structural integrity and cost-effectiveness of the remaining construction phases. Additionally, Robert should consider seeking advice from his boss or a legal consultant to address any potential liability concerns for his firm.
