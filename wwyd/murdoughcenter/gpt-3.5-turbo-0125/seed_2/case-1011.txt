I would thank John Bigge for considering me for the final engineering design of the project. I would express my interest in the opportunity and request a meeting to discuss the project in more detail. During this meeting, I would ask for specific details about the project scope, timeline, and any key requirements. I would also inquire about the concerns raised in the preliminary report and how they should be addressed in the final design. Additionally, I would ask about the budget for the project and ensure that my firm can deliver within those constraints. Finally, I would confirm my availability to take on the project and discuss next steps for moving forward with the final engineering design work.
