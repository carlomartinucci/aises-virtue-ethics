I would advise Rod to report the observed gifts being given to the resident engineer by the individual foremen to Ethel Hicks, who is the supervisor at the DOT headquarters. This report should be made as soon as possible after witnessing the incidents, providing clear and specific details about what was observed. Additionally, I would recommend that Rod document the incidents in writing to ensure accuracy and to have a record of the events for reference. It is important to address this issue promptly and directly with the appropriate authority to uphold ethical standards and maintain integrity in the project.
