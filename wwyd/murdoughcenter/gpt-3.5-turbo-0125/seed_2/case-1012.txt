I would promptly gather all relevant documentation related to the selection of the pumps for the wastewater treatment plant project, including emails, meeting minutes, and design specifications. I would then schedule a meeting with my project engineer, Florence Moore, to discuss the situation and review our decision-making process regarding the pump selection.

During the meeting, I would carefully go through the reasons why we initially chose the Excelsior pumps over the Pumpco pumps, highlighting the long-term advantages and life-cycle savings that were documented from previous projects. I would also review the correspondence with the city's project manager, Dee Taylor, regarding her concerns and the ultimate decision to specify the Pumpco equipment in the bid documents.

Based on this review and discussion with Flo Moore, I would draft a clear and detailed statement for the Elm Grove Gazette, outlining the rationale behind our original pump selection, the concerns raised by the city's project manager, and the factors that ultimately led to the decision to specify the Pumpco pumps. I would emphasize that the decision was made in collaboration with the city and in consideration of their budget constraints at the time.

I would also express our willingness to work with the city to address the recurring pump failures and find a satisfactory solution to ensure the long-term functionality and efficiency of the wastewater treatment plant. Finally, I would be prepared to provide any additional information or clarification requested by the Gazette to ensure transparency and accountability in our handling of the situation.
