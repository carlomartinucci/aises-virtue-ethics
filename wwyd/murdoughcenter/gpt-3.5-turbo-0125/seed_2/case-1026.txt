Jack should immediately contact the drilling crew and geologist who worked on the site of the proposed office building complex to request clarification and verification of the subsurface exploration logs and data. He should ask for detailed information on the exact locations of the borings and any specific challenges or issues encountered during the drilling process. Jack should also request additional documentation or evidence to support the accuracy of the data provided.

If the drilling crew and geologist are unable to provide satisfactory explanations or evidence to validate the subsurface exploration data, Jack should consider arranging for a new round of drilling and sampling at the site to ensure the accuracy of the information he will base his design recommendations on. This may require expedited scheduling and coordination with the drilling manager, Ernest Downholt, to meet the tight deadline for the foundation design recommendation report.

Additionally, Jack should document all communication and actions taken regarding this issue for transparency and accountability purposes. He should prioritize ensuring the integrity and reliability of the data used in his analysis and design recommendations to uphold professional standards and client expectations.
