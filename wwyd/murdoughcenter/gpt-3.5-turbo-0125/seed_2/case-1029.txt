I would recommend that Clayton explore the option of reassigning Eleanor to a role within the Public Works department that better aligns with her current capabilities and energy levels. This could involve shifting her responsibilities to tasks that are less demanding and more suitable given her personal circumstances. By doing so, Clayton can provide Eleanor with the support she needs during her troubled times while also ensuring that the department's needs are met. Additionally, Clayton could consider providing Eleanor with additional support or accommodations, such as flexible work hours or reduced workload, to help her manage her health issues and caregiving responsibilities effectively. This approach would demonstrate compassion towards Eleanor while also balancing the needs of the department and adhering to civil service regulations.
