If I were one of the engineers in the Gamma Group Omaha office, I would have considered the impact of resigning and joining Ralph and Dorph at Compass Associates on my own career prospects, the reputation within the industry, and the relationships with the existing clients. I would have evaluated the long-term consequences of my decision and assessed whether joining Compass Associates aligned with my professional values and goals. Additionally, I would have communicated with the management at Gamma Group to express any concerns or seek clarity on the future plans for the Omaha office.

Regarding Ralph's actions, I feel that his decision to leave the Gamma Group abruptly, along with Dorph, and actively recruit employees from his former office to join Compass Associates was unethical. It created disruption within the Gamma Group Omaha office, potentially damaging the relationships with clients and causing uncertainty for the remaining staff. Ralph's actions lacked transparency and consideration for the impact on others, and his wife's involvement in persuading employees to leave added to the unethical nature of the situation.
