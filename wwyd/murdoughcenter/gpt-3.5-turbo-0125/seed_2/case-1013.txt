I would comply with the directive from my manager and issue the final report as revised by the Dewey law firm. Despite the concerns raised by the older gentleman at the lunch counter, the information he provided was hearsay and not based on concrete evidence. Additionally, the client, Americorp, is aware of the alleged contamination and has decided to proceed with the refinancing despite this knowledge. 

Given that the property is not being sold, the client has all the relevant information, and the financing for their new project is at stake, it is important to prioritize the client's needs and interests in this situation. Failing to provide the final report as requested could result in significant financial losses for the client, potential legal action against me personally, and damage to the relationship between our firm and Americorp.

Therefore, in order to fulfill my professional obligations, maintain the trust of the client, and protect both myself and my firm from potential legal and reputational consequences, I would follow my manager's directive and issue the final report as revised by the Dewey law firm.
