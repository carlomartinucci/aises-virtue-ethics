Gwen should schedule a meeting with Lawrence to express her concerns about accessing the employees' email files on their PCs. During the meeting, she should explain to Lawrence that while she understands his concerns about email usage, accessing the emails in this manner could potentially violate the privacy of the employees and damage the trust within the organization. Gwen should propose alternative solutions to address the issue of excessive email usage, such as implementing training sessions on proper email etiquette or monitoring email activity through the network server without accessing individual emails. She should emphasize the importance of maintaining a respectful and trusting work environment while still upholding company policies.
