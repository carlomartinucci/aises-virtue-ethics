I would express my concerns about the situation to the Vice President for Operations, highlighting the potential ethical issues involved. I would suggest a meeting with the project manager of the Wellfleet project to discuss the current status, budget shortfall, and potential solutions. I would propose reallocating resources or renegotiating the contract to ensure that the project can be completed properly within budget constraints. Additionally, I would recommend implementing better project management practices to prevent similar issues in the future. If necessary, I would escalate the matter to higher management or seek guidance from the firm's legal department to address any contractual obligations.
