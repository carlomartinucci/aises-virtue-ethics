Reilly should conduct a thorough inspection of the existing treatment room to verify whether it is indeed explosion proof as claimed by the fire code official. This inspection should include checking the electrical sockets, light switches, lighting fixtures, and junction boxes for compliance with the requirements of NFPA 820. If Reilly finds any discrepancies or evidence that the room is not explosion proof, he should document his findings and report them to the project manager, Dante McWaves, immediately. Reilly should prioritize safety and compliance with regulations over potential project delays or inconveniencing stakeholders like Bull Parker. It is crucial to ensure the wastewater treatment plant meets all necessary safety standards to protect both the workers and the community.
