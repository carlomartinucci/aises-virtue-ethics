I would advise Sam to carefully review the transition plan proposed by Max and consider the potential consequences of each action. Sam should also seek advice from a trusted financial or legal advisor to ensure that the proposed actions are ethical and legal. Sam should prioritize the long-term well-being of the company and its employees, making sure that any decisions made are in the best interest of all stakeholders involved. It would be important for Sam to maintain transparency and open communication with the employees about any changes that may impact them.
