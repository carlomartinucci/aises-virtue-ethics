I would prepare thoroughly by gathering all relevant documents, reports, and evidence related to the geotechnical study and pile design recommendations for the fly-over bridge. I would also review the specifications provided to the developer for the pipe piles and any communication regarding the field observations made by my firm during the site grading phase.

During the mediation hearing, I would present the technical facts and evidence clearly and professionally to support the position that the pile design recommendations were correct and that the issues arose due to the inferior quality of the materials used by Deepdown Pile. I would emphasize that my firm was not allowed to be present during the pile driving to address any problems that arose in the field.

If pressured to participate financially in the settlement, I would stand firm on the position that my firm bears no financial responsibility for the claim and would not contribute to the settlement. I would maintain integrity and professionalism throughout the mediation process, focusing on presenting the technical evidence to support our position.
