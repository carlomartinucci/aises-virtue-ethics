I would advise Julie to carefully review the situation and weigh the potential consequences of her actions. She should consider seeking a second opinion from another structural engineer to verify Brock's findings about the rusted clip angles on the exterior granite veneer of the building. If the second opinion confirms the severity of the issue, Julie should consider disclosing this critical information to the prospective buyers through proper channels, such as communicating directly with Sam Goldworthy, the attorney representing the foreign investors.

Julie should prioritize the safety implications of the rusted clip angles over the potential impact on her business relationship with Charles Smith. It is essential for her to act ethically and responsibly by ensuring that all parties involved are fully informed about the structural integrity issues of the building. Julie should not compromise on safety and structural integrity for the sake of maintaining business relationships.
