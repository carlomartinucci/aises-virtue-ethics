I would firmly reiterate my professional recommendation to the contractor, emphasizing the potential long-term consequences of using shallow footings instead of piles. I would provide clear and detailed explanations of the risks associated with settling over time and the negative impacts it could have on the structural integrity and safety of the buildings.

I would also offer to provide additional documentation and data to support my recommendation, including case studies or examples of similar projects where settling issues arose due to using shallow footings on compressible soils.

If the contractor continues to insist on using shallow footings despite my professional advice, I would document all communication and decision-making processes carefully. I would include a clear disclaimer in my report stating that the recommendation for shallow footings was made against my professional judgment and that I strongly advise against it.

Ultimately, I would prioritize the safety and long-term performance of the structures, even if it means risking not getting paid for my services.
