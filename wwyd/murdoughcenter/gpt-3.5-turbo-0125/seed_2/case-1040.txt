Ethan should schedule a meeting with Marc to discuss his concerns about the field changes that have been authorized. During the meeting, Ethan should provide specific examples of the hardware substitutions that he believes are inferior and explain his reasoning for why these changes are not in line with the quality standards agreed upon during the bid phase.

Ethan should express his commitment to designing a high-quality project that meets the agreed-upon specifications and discuss the potential consequences of implementing these unauthorized field changes. He should emphasize the importance of maintaining the trust of the client, EDOT, and ensuring that the project is completed to the highest standards.

Ethan should work collaboratively with Marc to find a resolution to the issue, such as reverting back to the original specifications, finding alternative solutions that meet both quality and cost requirements, or seeking approval from the client for any deviations from the initial design.

Ethan should document the meeting and any decisions made regarding the field changes to ensure transparency and accountability within the TE/STI partnership. This will help protect both parties from potential disputes and ensure that the project is completed successfully while upholding the integrity of the design and construction process.
