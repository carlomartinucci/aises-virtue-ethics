I would decline the offer from Mr. Owatadeel and International Affiliates Ltd. to act as the local associate for obtaining the petrochemical plant design project in Utopia. The requested retainer fee, hourly charges, and additional allowances for presentations and gifts to key directors amount to a significant portion of the anticipated profit for the project. Furthermore, the suggestion of needing to pay for marketing gifts raises ethical concerns about potential bribery or unethical business practices.

Instead, I would explore alternative options for establishing a local presence in Utopia. This may involve directly engaging with local authorities, seeking legal advice on the requirements for foreign companies operating in the country, and potentially partnering with a different local firm that does not raise ethical red flags. It is crucial to ensure that any business dealings in Utopia are conducted in a transparent, legal, and ethical manner to maintain the integrity of Choice Engineering, Inc. and uphold ethical business practices.
