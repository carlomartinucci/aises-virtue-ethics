At this point, I would feel optimistic about the job interview process given that all four companies have indicated they are likely to make me an offer for a good position at an excellent salary. To further solidify my chances of securing a position in the new location, I would proactively follow up with each of the four companies individually to express my continued interest in working for their company and to reiterate my enthusiasm for the opportunity. Additionally, I would ensure that I promptly respond to any communication from the companies and provide any additional information or references they may require to expedite the offer process. It is essential to maintain open and professional communication with all potential employers to demonstrate my commitment and interest in joining their team.
