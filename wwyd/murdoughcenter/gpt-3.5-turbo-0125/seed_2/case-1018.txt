I would first carefully document the situation by taking note of the identical project reports and the number of students involved. Then, I would schedule individual meetings with each of the 7 students to discuss the issue. During these meetings, I would ask them to explain their project in detail, inquire about their understanding of the content, and address the similarities in their reports.

I would also review the university's academic integrity policy to ensure that I am following the correct procedures. If the students admit to academic misconduct or if there is strong evidence of plagiarism, I would inform them of the consequences as outlined in the policy, which may include failing the project or the course.

Additionally, I would reach out to a senior faculty member or academic integrity committee for guidance on how to proceed in the absence of the department chair. It is important to handle the situation fairly and impartially, considering the impact on the students' academic records and the reputation of the university's graduate program.
