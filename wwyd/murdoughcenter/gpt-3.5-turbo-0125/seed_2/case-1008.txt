I would immediately contact my supervisor and the legal department within my firm to inform them of the situation. I would provide a detailed account of what I witnessed at the Industrial Solvents site, including Mr. Klene's actions of tampering with the monitoring wells. I would emphasize the potential implications of this tampering on the accuracy and reliability of our final report.

I would request guidance on how to proceed, particularly considering the confidentiality clause in our contract with Industrial Solvents Ltd. It would be crucial to discuss the ethical and legal implications of this discovery and seek advice on how to handle the upcoming presentation to the state regulatory agency.

Additionally, I would document all the information and observations I gathered during my visit to the site, ensuring that there is a clear record of events for future reference. This documentation would serve as evidence to support any necessary actions taken by our firm in response to the situation.
