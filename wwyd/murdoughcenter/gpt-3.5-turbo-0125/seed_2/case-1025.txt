I would decline the settlement offer from the adjacent property owner and continue to defend my firm in court. I would provide all the evidence and documentation, including the written comment in the design report advising the bank to obtain permission for the tiebacks, to prove that my firm acted ethically and in accordance with professional standards. I would work closely with my lawyer to present a strong defense in court and ensure that the facts are accurately conveyed to the judge or jury. Additionally, I would review the actions of the contractor, bank, architect, and structural engineer to determine if they acted unethically by failing to obtain permission for the tiebacks and not abandoning them as planned.
