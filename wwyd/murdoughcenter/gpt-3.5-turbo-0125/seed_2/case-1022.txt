Question 1:
If I accept the assignment from Zeller, I would first assess the scope and complexity of the project to determine the level of effort required. I would then calculate a fee based on my time, resources, and expertise needed to develop a unique solution for Zeller. Given the similarity to the previous project for Hartwell, I would consider offering a fee slightly higher than what was charged to Hartwell, taking into account any additional value or expertise I can bring to the table for Zeller.

Question 2:
If contacted by Hartwell to participate with them, I would base my fee on a similar approach as with Zeller. I would evaluate the project requirements, assess the level of effort needed, and determine a fee that reflects the value of my services to Hartwell. Since Hartwell is a repeat client, I may consider offering a slightly discounted fee compared to Zeller, as a gesture of goodwill and to maintain a positive relationship with Hartwell.

Question 3:
If I find out that Hartwell has decided not to bid on the project, my decision on the fee for working with Zeller would remain the same. The absence of competition from Hartwell does not significantly impact the value of my services to Zeller or the effort required to develop a solution for them. Therefore, I would continue to base my fee on the project requirements and the value I can provide to Zeller.
