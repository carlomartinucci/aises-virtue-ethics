I would recommend that Topher schedule a meeting with the design engineers responsible for the Windsor Ridge development. During this meeting, he should bring up his concerns about the potential adverse impacts on the poorer families downstream. Topher should discuss possible modifications to the design that could mitigate these impacts while still allowing the development to proceed. By working collaboratively with the engineers, Topher can ensure that the project meets all required codes and regulations while also addressing the concerns of the affected community.
