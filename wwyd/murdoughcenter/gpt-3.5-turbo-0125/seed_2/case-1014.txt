Given the scenario, I would advise Roger to take the following specific actions:

1. In the current situation, Roger should express his concerns more firmly to his boss, Bill Mason, emphasizing his ethical discomfort with providing the draft report to Frank Bullock, especially considering the potential conflict of interest and confidentiality issues involved.

2. Roger should request a meeting with both Frank Bullock and Bill Mason to discuss the situation and seek clarification on how the information from the draft report will be handled, ensuring transparency and ethical behavior within the firm.

3. Moving forward, Roger should document all instances where he feels pressured to compromise his professional integrity or ethical standards in any project. This documentation can serve as evidence or support if similar situations arise in the future.

4. Roger should consider seeking advice from a professional engineering ethics organization or a mentor within the field to gain insights on how to navigate such ethical dilemmas effectively.

By taking these specific actions, Roger can address the current ethical issue he is facing and establish a more robust approach to handling similar situations in the future.
