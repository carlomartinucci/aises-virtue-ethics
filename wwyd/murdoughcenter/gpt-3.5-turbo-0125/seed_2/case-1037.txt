I would inform Fulton Adams about the observations I made at the engineering society conference regarding Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert entering a room together. I would explain the context in which I noticed this and the subsequent discreet inquiries I made that revealed they have been living together since the Kinkora case started. I would leave it to Mr. Adams to decide how to proceed with this information, as it may be relevant to the case or the behavior of the opposing expert witness.
