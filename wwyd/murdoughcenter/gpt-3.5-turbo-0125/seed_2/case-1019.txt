I would document all the observations and interactions related to Roy and the young woman, including dates, times, locations, and any relevant details. I would discreetly gather information to see if there are any instances of preferential treatment towards Hotspark Electrical. I would also start keeping a record of any potential compromises in the quality of work by Hotspark on ongoing projects.

Next, I would schedule a meeting with the president of Global Engineering and Construction, presenting my documented observations and concerns about the situation with Roy and Hotspark Electrical. I would emphasize the potential risks of conflicts of interest and compromises in project quality. I would seek guidance on how to proceed effectively in addressing this issue while ensuring the integrity of the firm's projects.

Based on the president's advice, I would consider involving the human resources department or the legal department to determine the best course of action regarding Roy's behavior and the potential impact on the firm's projects and reputation. I would prioritize the firm's interests and the quality of work delivered to clients in handling this sensitive matter.
