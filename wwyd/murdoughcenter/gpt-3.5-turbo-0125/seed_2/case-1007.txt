I would first gather all the specific information that Alice, Ted, and my wife shared during the weekend about the potential conflicts of interest involving Shreud Contractors, Gus Olson, Ray Vandergrafft, the university, and Fred Facade. I would make detailed notes of the timeline, projects, individuals involved, and any suspicious activities mentioned.

Next, I would discreetly reach out to the University President, the Vice President for Finance, and Fred Facade to schedule separate meetings to discuss the information I have received. During these meetings, I would present the specific details of the potential conflicts of interest and express my concerns regarding the integrity of the university's construction projects.

I would emphasize the importance of maintaining transparency, fairness, and ethical conduct in all dealings with contractors, architects, and construction projects at the university. I would suggest conducting a thorough review of the contracting processes, including the recent contracts awarded to Shreud Contractors, to ensure compliance with ethical standards and to avoid any appearance of impropriety.

Additionally, I would offer my assistance in reviewing future construction projects, providing insights on best practices to prevent conflicts of interest, and promoting a culture of integrity within the university's construction programs.
