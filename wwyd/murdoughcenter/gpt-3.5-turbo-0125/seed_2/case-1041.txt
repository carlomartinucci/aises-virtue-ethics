Carlos should prioritize the safety and well-being of the workers above all else. He should document his safety concerns in writing to protect himself legally, and then insist on implementing additional safety measures on the construction site. Carlos should also seek advice from legal professionals about the implications of hiring illegal immigrants and the potential risks involved. If the situation remains unchanged, Carlos should consider escalating his concerns to higher management within the company or even relevant authorities to ensure the workers' safety.
