I would advise Topher to schedule a meeting with the design engineers responsible for the Windsor Ridge development. During this meeting, he should express his concerns about the potential adverse impacts on the poorer families living south of the development, particularly regarding increased vehicle traffic and modified drainage patterns. Topher should request that the engineers explore alternative solutions or modifications to the plans that could mitigate these negative effects on the community downstream. Additionally, he should emphasize the importance of considering the well-being of all residents of Plebian, not just the economic benefits of the development. By proactively addressing these concerns with the engineers, Topher can work towards finding a more balanced and equitable solution for the community.
