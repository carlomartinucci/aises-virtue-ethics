Ethan should schedule a meeting with Marc to discuss his concerns about the field changes that have been authorized. During the meeting, Ethan should clearly outline his reservations about the substitutions made by Marc and express his belief that the quality of materials and design has been compromised. Ethan should provide specific examples and evidence to support his position. Additionally, Ethan should propose a collaborative approach to address the issue, such as conducting a thorough review of the field changes together to ensure that they align with the project specifications and quality standards. Ethan should emphasize the importance of maintaining the trust of EDOT and delivering a high-quality project. If necessary, Ethan should seek guidance from legal counsel to ensure that his actions are in compliance with the partnership agreement and his professional obligations.
