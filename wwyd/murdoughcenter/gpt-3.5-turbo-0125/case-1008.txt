I would immediately contact my supervisor and the legal department within my firm to inform them of the situation. I would provide a detailed account of what I witnessed at the Industrial Solvents site, including Mr. Klene's actions of tampering with the monitoring wells. I would emphasize the potential impact on the accuracy and reliability of the data presented in the final report.

I would recommend that the legal department review the confidentiality clause in the contract with Industrial Solvents Ltd. to determine the best course of action regarding the release of the information to the state regulatory agency. Additionally, I would suggest that we prepare a revised report based on the new information and findings from the site visit.

Furthermore, I would advise my supervisor to consider postponing the presentation to the state regulatory agency until the situation is resolved and the revised report is completed. It is crucial to uphold the integrity and credibility of our firm's work and ensure that accurate information is provided to all stakeholders involved.
