I would first gather all the identical project reports submitted by the students and carefully compare them side by side to confirm the extent of the plagiarism. Then, I would schedule individual meetings with each of the seven students who submitted the identical reports to discuss the issue. During these meetings, I would confront the students with the evidence of plagiarism and give them the opportunity to explain themselves.

Based on the university's academic integrity policy and the seriousness of the offense, I would then determine the appropriate consequences for each student, which may include failing the project, failing the course, or further disciplinary actions as per university guidelines. I would document these decisions and communicate them clearly to the students.

Additionally, I would report the incident to the university's academic integrity office or relevant authority for further investigation and potential disciplinary action. I would also document the incident and my actions taken in response to it for my own records and potential future reference.

Lastly, I would consider discussing the situation with a trusted colleague or mentor for advice and support in handling this challenging ethical dilemma.
