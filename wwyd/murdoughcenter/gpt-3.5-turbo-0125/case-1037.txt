I would document the information I have gathered about Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert's personal relationship and the fact that they are living together. I would then inform Fulton Adams about this discovery, as it could potentially be relevant to the case at hand. It may raise questions about the objectivity and integrity of Cleghorn's testimony and the plaintiff's case overall. Adams can decide how to proceed with this new information in the best interest of the defendant.
