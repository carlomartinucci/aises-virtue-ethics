I would advise Sam to carefully consider the consequences of each step outlined in the transition plan proposed by Max. Sam should prioritize maintaining the integrity and reputation of In-Line Engineering while also ensuring the well-being of the employees. It is important for Sam to seek alternative solutions that do not compromise the ethical standards and values of the company. Sam should also seek advice from a legal or financial advisor to explore other options for saving the business without resorting to deceptive or harmful practices.
