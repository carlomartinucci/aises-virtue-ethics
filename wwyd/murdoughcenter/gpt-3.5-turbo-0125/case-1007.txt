I would first gather all the information I have heard from Alice and Ted about the potential conflicts of interest involving Shreud Contractors, Gus Olson, Ray Vandergrafft, and Fred Facade. I would then carefully document these details, including the specific projects mentioned and the relationships between the individuals involved.

Next, I would review any relevant codes of conduct or ethical guidelines that my architectural firm follows, as well as any professional standards set by architectural associations or regulatory bodies. I would assess whether the actions described by Alice and Ted violate any of these standards.

After that, I would schedule a meeting with the University President and the Vice President for Finance to discuss the information I have received. I would present the documented details of the potential conflicts of interest and express my concerns about the integrity of the construction projects at the university.

During the meeting, I would emphasize the importance of transparency, fairness, and ethical conduct in all construction projects undertaken by the university. I would suggest conducting a thorough review of the contracting processes to ensure that they are free from any conflicts of interest or favoritism.

Additionally, I would offer my assistance in any further investigations or audits that the university may wish to conduct to address these concerns and uphold the reputation of the institution.

Finally, I would follow up with the University President and the Vice President for Finance to inquire about any actions taken in response to the information I provided and offer ongoing support in promoting ethical practices in the university's construction projects.
