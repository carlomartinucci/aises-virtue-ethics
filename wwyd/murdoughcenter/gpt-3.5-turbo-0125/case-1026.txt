Jack should immediately contact the drilling crew and geologist who conducted the borings for the project. He should request a meeting with them as soon as possible to discuss the discrepancies between the provided boring logs and the actual site conditions. Jack should ask for clarification on the locations and depths of the borings, as well as any potential reasons for the lack of visible evidence on the site.

During the meeting, Jack should carefully review the data collected during the borings and compare it with the project requirements. He should also inquire about the specific procedures followed during the drilling operations to ensure that all necessary information was accurately recorded.

After gathering all relevant information and clarifications from the drilling crew and geologist, Jack should conduct a thorough review of the subsurface exploration logs and data to determine the accuracy and reliability of the information provided. If there are any discrepancies or uncertainties, Jack should consider conducting additional borings or tests to obtain the necessary data for his foundation design recommendations.

Given the time constraints and the importance of the project, Jack should prioritize resolving the discrepancies in the data promptly to meet the deadline for the foundation design recommendation report. He should communicate any delays or changes in the project timeline to the client as soon as possible to manage expectations and ensure transparency in the process.
