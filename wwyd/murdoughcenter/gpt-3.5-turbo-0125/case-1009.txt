I would express my disappointment to Mr. Young for not informing me about his decision to give the scope of work to a competitor. I would then ask for a meeting with Mr. Young to discuss the situation further and to understand his reasoning behind choosing the competitor over my firm. During the meeting, I would emphasize the value and expertise that my firm brings to the project, highlighting our experience and successful track record in similar projects. I would also inquire about any specific concerns or requirements that led to his decision, in order to address them and potentially salvage the relationship for future projects.
