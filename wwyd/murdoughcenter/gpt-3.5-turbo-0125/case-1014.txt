Roger should document his concerns and the sequence of events in writing, including his uneasiness about providing the draft report to Frank Bullock and his conversation with Bill Mason. He should keep a record of all communications related to this issue for his own protection.

In the future, Roger should be cautious about sharing sensitive project information with individuals who may have conflicting interests, such as private sector clients. He should clarify the firm's policies on sharing draft reports and seek guidance from a more neutral party within the organization if he feels uncomfortable with a request similar to the one made by Frank Bullock.
