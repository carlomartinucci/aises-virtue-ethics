I would first carefully review the company's policies and code of conduct to see if there are any guidelines related to political contributions or conflicts of interest. If there are no specific policies in place, I would seek advice from a trusted mentor within the company or from HR to understand the potential implications of not making the contribution. I would also consider discussing the situation with my colleagues who were also present in the meeting to gather their perspectives and insights. Based on the information gathered, I would make a decision on whether to make the contribution or not, taking into account my personal values and the potential impact on my career at CWE.
