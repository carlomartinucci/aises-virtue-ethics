Gwen should schedule a meeting with Lawrence to express her concerns about accessing the employees' email files on their PCs. During the meeting, she should explain to Lawrence the potential negative consequences of breaching the employees' privacy and the impact it could have on the company culture and employee morale. Gwen should propose alternative solutions to address the issue of excessive personal use of email, such as implementing training sessions on email etiquette or monitoring email usage through the company's server without accessing individual PCs. She should emphasize the importance of maintaining trust and respect within the workplace while still upholding company policies.
