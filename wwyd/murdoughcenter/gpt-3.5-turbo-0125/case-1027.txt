In the morning, I would decide to be transparent with Bill Broot about the cost estimate for the new project site. I would inform him that the estimated cost for the design work on the new project site, considering the reuse of information and analyses from the Dawson site, would be $22,800. I would explain the breakdown of the estimate and the factors that led to this reduced cost compared to a completely new project site. Additionally, I would emphasize the importance of staying within budget constraints to ensure a successful project outcome for both parties.
