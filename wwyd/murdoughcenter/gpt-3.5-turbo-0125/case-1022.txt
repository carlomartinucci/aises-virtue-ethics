Question 1:
If I accept the assignment from Zeller, I would decide on my fee by considering the complexity of the project, the level of expertise required, the time and resources needed to develop the solution, and the potential value that my solution would bring to Zeller Construction Inc. I would also take into account the market rates for similar services in the local area and negotiate a fair fee based on these factors.

Question 2:
If I am contacted by Hartwell to participate with them, I would decide on the fee by considering the past successful collaboration with Hartwell, the value of my expertise in solving the construction problem, and the potential benefits that my solution could bring to Hartwell Construction. I would also take into account the fee structure used in the previous project with Hartwell and negotiate a fee that is fair and reflective of the value I would bring to the project.

Question 3:
If I find out that Hartwell has decided not to bid on the project, my decision on the fee would remain similar to the previous scenario. I would still consider the complexity of the project, the expertise required, the potential value of my solution to Zeller Construction Inc., and the market rates for similar services in determining a fair fee for my assistance.
