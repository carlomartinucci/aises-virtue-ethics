I would recommend that Clayton explore alternative options to support Eleanor during this difficult time. Specifically, he could consider temporarily reassigning her to a role that is better suited to her current energy levels and capabilities within the Public Works department. By identifying a position that aligns with Eleanor's strengths and allows her to continue contributing meaningfully to the team, Clayton can demonstrate compassion while also ensuring that the department's operations remain efficient. Additionally, Clayton should work with HR to review the possibility of providing Eleanor with additional support or accommodations to help her manage her personal circumstances while maintaining her employment until she is eligible to collect her pension. This approach would enable Clayton to balance the needs of the department with supporting a long-serving employee in need.
