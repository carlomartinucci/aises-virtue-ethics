Dianne should review the design of the Shadyvale project based on the existing utility layout and the DOT policy that only unavoidable utility conflicts will be paid for as part of highway projects. She should make sure the design avoids impacting the old water main, as she originally intended. Dianne should then have a conversation with Warren, expressing her concerns about the potential impact on the water main and the deviation from DOT policy. She should seek clarity on Warren's expectations and decision-making process regarding the project. Dianne should prioritize following the established policies and guidelines while also addressing any potential conflicts or discrepancies with her supervisor.
