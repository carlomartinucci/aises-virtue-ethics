As Ethan, I would first schedule a meeting with Marc to discuss the field changes that have been made without Ethan's agreement. During the meeting, I would calmly and professionally express my concerns about the quality of the materials and design that have been substituted. I would provide specific examples and reasons why I believe these changes are not in the best interest of the project.

Next, I would propose a thorough review process for any future field changes to ensure that they align with the project specifications and quality standards agreed upon during the bid phase. This review process would involve input from both engineering and construction teams to reach a consensus on any modifications before they are implemented.

Additionally, I would suggest revisiting and amending the TE/STI partnership agreement to include a clear protocol for resolving design conflicts and ensuring that changes made in the field do not compromise the overall quality of the project. This could involve establishing a mechanism for joint decision-making on significant modifications and a process for escalating unresolved issues to higher management if needed.

Ultimately, my goal would be to find a collaborative solution with Marc that prioritizes the project's success, maintains the trust of the client (EDOT), and upholds the integrity of the design and construction work being done by the TE/STI partnership.
