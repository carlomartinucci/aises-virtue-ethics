I would feel excited and optimistic about the job interview process, given that all four companies have indicated they are likely to make me an offer for a good position at an excellent salary. It is a positive sign that my skills and experience are valued in the new location.

At this point, since I have expressed my strong interest in working for each of the firms and am awaiting firm offers, I would stay proactive by following up with each company to reiterate my enthusiasm for the potential positions. I would also ensure that I have provided all necessary information and documentation requested by the companies promptly to expedite the offer process. Additionally, I would keep communication lines open with my future spouse to coordinate our relocation plans effectively.
