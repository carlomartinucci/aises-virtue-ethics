I would document this information and bring it to the attention of Fulton Adams, the legal counsel for the insurance company representing Wastewater Treatment Systems. I would explain the situation regarding Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert, including their potential personal relationship, and the impact it could have on the ongoing case.

It would be important to ensure that all relevant information is disclosed to the legal team to make informed decisions moving forward in the lawsuit.
