I would not sign up for the service offered by Creative Communications Corporation (CCC) that allows for internal markups on long distance telephone charges to clients. I would continue billing my clients for "out-of-pocket" or "reimbursable" expenses at actual cost, as requested by the clients, without adding any markup for overhead costs. This approach maintains transparency and honesty in billing practices, aligning with the clients' expectations and requirements.
