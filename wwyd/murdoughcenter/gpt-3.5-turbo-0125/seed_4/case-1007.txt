I would first gather all the information I have heard about the potential conflicts of interest involving Shreud Contractors, the University Architect, and the construction projects at the university. I would document the details shared by Ted and Alice Hammer regarding the construction projects and relationships involved.

Next, I would review any relevant policies or guidelines from professional organizations or the university regarding conflicts of interest and ethical behavior. This would help me understand the expectations and standards in the industry.

After that, I would schedule a meeting with the University President, the Vice President for Finance, or both to discuss the information I have learned. I would present the details of the potential conflicts of interest and express my concerns about the integrity of the construction projects at the university.

During the meeting, I would emphasize the importance of transparency, fairness, and ethical conduct in the selection and execution of construction contracts at the university. I would urge them to investigate the situations involving Shreud Contractors, the University Architect, and the construction projects to ensure that proper procedures are being followed and that there is no impropriety.

Additionally, I would offer my assistance in any further investigation or review that the university may conduct to address these concerns. I would also be prepared to provide any additional information or insights that could help clarify the situation and ensure that ethical standards are upheld in the university's building program.

Overall, my actions would be aimed at raising awareness about the potential conflicts of interest, advocating for ethical behavior, and promoting accountability in the construction projects at the university.
