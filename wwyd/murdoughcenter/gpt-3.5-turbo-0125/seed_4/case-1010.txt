I would advise Julie to conduct further investigation into the condition of the exterior granite cladding of the Inverness Block. She should hire an independent structural engineer to thoroughly assess the extent of the rusted clip angles and evaluate the potential risks associated with the building's structural integrity. This additional assessment would provide Julie with a more comprehensive understanding of the situation and enable her to make informed decisions about how to proceed. Additionally, she should document all findings and discussions related to this matter to protect her firm's reputation and ensure transparency in her actions.
