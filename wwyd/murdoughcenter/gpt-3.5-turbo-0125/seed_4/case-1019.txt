I would schedule a meeting with the president of Global Engineering and Construction to discuss my concerns regarding the potential conflict of interest between Roy and the general manager of Hotspark Electrical Co. I would present the observations I have made, including the unusual interactions between Roy and the young woman, as well as the suspicions of preferential treatment for Hotspark Electrical.

During the meeting, I would emphasize the importance of maintaining integrity and ensuring that all business dealings are conducted ethically and without bias. I would inquire about the company's stance on conflicts of interest and how they handle such situations. I would also express my commitment to upholding the values of the company and ensuring that all projects are executed with the highest standards of professionalism.

Based on the discussion with the president, I would follow any directives given regarding investigating the matter further or taking appropriate action to address the potential conflict of interest. I would also make it clear that my primary concern is the reputation and success of the company, and that I am willing to take whatever steps are necessary to uphold these principles.
