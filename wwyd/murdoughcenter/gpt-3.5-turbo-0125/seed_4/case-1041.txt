I would suggest that Carlos firmly reiterate his concerns about the safety of the Ecuadorian workers and the potential legal risks to the company due to their immigration status. He should emphasize that prioritizing safety is crucial to avoid any accidents on the construction site and to protect the well-being of all workers involved. Additionally, he should stress the importance of following legal procedures and ensuring that all workers are properly compensated and insured.

Furthermore, Carlos should document his recommendations and concerns in writing, detailing the safety measures and qualifications needed to complete the project successfully. This documentation can serve as evidence of his efforts to prioritize safety and legality in case any issues arise in the future.

If his boss still insists on proceeding with the current workers despite Carlos's concerns, he should consider seeking advice from a legal expert or a relevant authority to understand his rights and responsibilities in this situation. It is essential for Carlos to uphold ethical standards, prioritize safety, and comply with legal regulations, even if it means risking his contract with the company.
