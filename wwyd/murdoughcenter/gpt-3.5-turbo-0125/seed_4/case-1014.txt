Roger should express his concerns to Bill Mason more explicitly, emphasizing the potential ethical issues surrounding the premature sharing of the draft report with Frank Bullock. He should request clarification on the firm's policies regarding client confidentiality and the handling of sensitive project information. Additionally, Roger should ask for assurance that such incidents will not occur in the future to maintain the integrity of the firm's work and relationships with clients. If necessary, Roger should consider escalating the matter to higher management or seeking external guidance on the ethical implications of such actions within the engineering consultancy industry.
