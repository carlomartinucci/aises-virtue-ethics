In the morning, I would decide to be transparent with Bill Broot about the cost estimate for the new project site. I would explain to him the breakdown of the estimated cost, highlighting the savings that can be achieved due to the reuse of information and analyses from the Dawson site. I would then propose a revised cost estimate of $22,800 for the design work on the new project site, taking into consideration the lessons learned from the overrun on the Dawson project and the importance of maintaining a sustainable and profitable relationship with Universal International Unlimited Developers.
