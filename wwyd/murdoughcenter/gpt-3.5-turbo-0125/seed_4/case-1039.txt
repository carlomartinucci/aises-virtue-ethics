I would immediately contact my supervisor, Chuck, and inform him about the situation regarding the drums. I would provide Chuck with all the details, including the fact that the drums have not been tested, and that the crew from the former employer is disposing of them in a residential area based on false information. I would emphasize the potential environmental and legal risks associated with this action and urge Chuck to take appropriate steps to address the situation. Additionally, I would offer to provide any necessary documentation or evidence to support my claims and ensure that the proper authorities are notified about the mishandling of hazardous waste.
