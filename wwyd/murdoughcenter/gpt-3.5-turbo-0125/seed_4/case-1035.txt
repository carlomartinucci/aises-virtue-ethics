Robert should schedule a meeting with Walker to discuss his concerns regarding the over-designed foundation for the mare barn. During the meeting, Robert should diplomatically explain the implications of the excessive use of concrete and steel, highlighting the potential cost savings and efficiency that could have been achieved with a more appropriate design based on his geotechnical recommendations. Robert should offer to provide further guidance and recommendations for the remaining barns and the residence construction to ensure that future structures are built in a cost-effective and structurally sound manner. Additionally, Robert should emphasize the importance of having a qualified design team in place to implement these recommendations accurately.
