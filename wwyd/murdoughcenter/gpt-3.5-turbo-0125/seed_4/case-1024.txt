I would immediately report the observed incidents of the individual foremen putting items in the back of the resident engineer's pickup truck to the appropriate authorities within the Department of Transportation. This would involve bringing this information to the attention of Ethel Hicks, who is Jim Upwright's supervisor at the DOT headquarters. I would do this as soon as possible to ensure transparency and integrity in the project. Additionally, I would document the incidents with as much detail as possible to provide a clear account of what I observed.
