Arthur and David should respond by taking the following specific actions:

1. Meet with Monroe to address his concerns directly and attempt to resolve the issue amicably. They should listen to his perspective, clarify any misunderstandings, and assure him of their commitment to ethical conduct.

2. Review and reiterate their firm's internal policies on conflict of interest to ensure that they are clear and comprehensive. They should also consider seeking advice from a legal or ethical consultant to ensure they are following best practices.

3. Communicate openly and transparently with the Fairview CSC and the larger community about the situation. They should provide reassurance that they are committed to ethical behavior and will take any necessary steps to address concerns about conflicts of interest.

4. Consider recusing themselves from any decision-making processes related to the awarding of contracts for the courthouse/office building project to demonstrate their commitment to avoiding conflicts of interest.

5. Engage in ongoing dialogue with the State professional engineering community to address any concerns raised by Monroe and others. They should be proactive in addressing any potential damage to their reputation or the integrity of the profession.

6. Continuously monitor the situation and be prepared to take further action if needed to uphold their ethical obligations and maintain the trust of their stakeholders.
