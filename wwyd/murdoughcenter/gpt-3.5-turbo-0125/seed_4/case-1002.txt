I would have communicated with the management of the Gamma Group in Boston about the sudden departure of Ralph and Dorph, expressing my concerns about the impact on ongoing projects and the future of the Omaha office. I would have also asked for clarity on the plans for replacing key personnel and ensuring continuity of work for the remaining employees. Additionally, I would have evaluated my own career options and considered the potential consequences of joining Ralph and Dorph at Compass Associates, weighing the benefits against the ethical considerations of leaving my current employer under these circumstances.
