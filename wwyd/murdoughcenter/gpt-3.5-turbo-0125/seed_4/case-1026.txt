Jack should immediately contact the drilling crew and geologist who were responsible for conducting the borings at the site of the proposed office building complex. He should request a detailed explanation of the drilling operations, including the locations of the borings, depths reached, and any unexpected challenges encountered during the process. Jack should also ask for photographic evidence or any other documentation that can validate the work that was supposedly done.

Additionally, Jack should consider hiring an independent third-party geotechnical engineer or drilling expert to conduct a review of the site and confirm the accuracy of the subsurface exploration data provided by the firm's crew. This independent verification will help ensure the integrity of his analyses and design recommendations for the foundation of the office building complex.

Given the tight deadline for the foundation design recommendation report, Jack should prioritize resolving the discrepancies in the data as quickly as possible to avoid any delays in meeting the client's deadline. He may need to work closely with the drilling crew, geologist, and any external experts to gather the necessary information and make informed decisions for the design recommendations.
