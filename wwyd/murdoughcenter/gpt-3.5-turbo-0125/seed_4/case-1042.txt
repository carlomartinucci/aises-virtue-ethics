I would advise Rashid to document his concerns regarding the potential problem with the steel beam coating in writing and submit a formal report to both Riley and the building inspector, Janis. In the report, Rashid should clearly outline the specific issue he observed, the potential risks it poses to the project and public safety, and his attempts to address the concern internally with Riley. Rashid should also request a meeting with both Riley and Janis to discuss the issue in more detail and seek guidance on how to proceed in ensuring the quality and safety of the project. By documenting his concerns and involving the relevant parties, Rashid can demonstrate his commitment to upholding standards while seeking support and guidance from his superiors and the building inspector.
