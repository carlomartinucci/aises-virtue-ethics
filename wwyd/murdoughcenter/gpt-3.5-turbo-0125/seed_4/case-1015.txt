I would firmly but professionally explain to the contractor the potential risks and consequences of using shallow footing foundations instead of piles based on the compressible nature of the subsoils at the site. I would provide clear and detailed information on how settlements over time could lead to structural issues such as cracking of floor slabs, differential movement of the second stories, and distress to the brick masonry and glass exteriors of the buildings.

I would emphasize that my professional recommendation is based on ensuring the long-term stability and integrity of the structures, even beyond the warranty period. I would offer to provide additional documentation and data to support my recommendation and address any concerns or questions the contractor may have.

If the contractor still insists on using shallow footings against my professional judgment and recommendations, I would document the situation thoroughly, including the risks communicated, the contractor's decision, and any potential consequences. I would also consider escalating the issue to the project manager or other relevant stakeholders within the design-build team to ensure that the decision-making process is transparent and all parties are aware of the potential risks involved.
