I would decline the offer from Owatadeel and International Affiliates Ltd. I would not engage in any unethical practices, such as paying fees for obtaining a contract or providing gifts to secure business. Instead, I would explore other avenues for establishing a local presence in Utopia that align with ethical business practices and regulations. This may involve seeking out other reputable local firms or consultants who can assist with navigating the local business landscape and building relationships with potential clients in a transparent and ethical manner.
