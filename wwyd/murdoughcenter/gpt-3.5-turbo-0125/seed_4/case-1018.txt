I would first review the university's academic integrity policy to understand the procedures and consequences for cases of plagiarism. Then, I would schedule individual meetings with each student who submitted the identical project reports to discuss the situation. During these meetings, I would clearly explain the issue of plagiarism, present the evidence of the identical reports, and give the students an opportunity to provide any explanation or defense.

Based on the university's policy and guidelines, I would determine the appropriate consequences for the students involved in the plagiarism. This could include penalties such as failing the project, receiving a reduced grade for the course, or being subject to other disciplinary actions outlined in the academic integrity policy.

After making my decisions, I would document the meetings, the evidence of plagiarism, and the actions taken in each student's academic records. I would then proceed to grade the remaining projects that were not involved in plagiarism, ensuring fairness and integrity in the evaluation process.
