Reilly should gather all relevant information and evidence regarding the explosion proof requirement for the treatment room. He should consult with a fire safety expert or someone knowledgeable about NFPA 820 to confirm whether the existing room meets the necessary standards. If there are doubts about the room's compliance, Reilly should communicate his concerns to Dante and the project manager, emphasizing the importance of ensuring safety and compliance with regulations. Reilly should propose a plan to address any potential issues, such as conducting a thorough inspection, making necessary upgrades, or seeking clarification from the fire code official. It is essential for Reilly to prioritize safety and regulatory compliance, even if it may lead to additional work or delays in the project.
