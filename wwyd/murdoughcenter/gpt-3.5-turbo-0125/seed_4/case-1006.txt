I would first seek advice from a trusted mentor or colleague within the company to get their perspective on the situation. I would also review the company's code of conduct and policies to see if there are any guidelines related to political contributions or conflicts of interest. Based on the advice received and the information gathered, I would then consider scheduling a meeting with HR or a higher-level manager to discuss my concerns and seek clarification on the expectations regarding contributions to the council members' campaign funds. During this meeting, I would express my discomfort with the situation and inquire about alternative ways to demonstrate loyalty and commitment to the firm.
