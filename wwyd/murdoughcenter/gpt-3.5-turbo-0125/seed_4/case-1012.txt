I would first gather all relevant documentation related to the selection of the pumps, including the initial proposal, correspondence with the city's project manager, and any reports or data on the performance of the pumps since installation. 

Next, I would schedule a meeting with my project engineer, Florence Moore, to discuss the situation and understand her perspective on the pump selection process. I would also review the documentation to ensure that the long-term advantages and life-cycle savings of the Excelsior pumps were clearly presented to the city's project manager, Dee Taylor.

Based on the information gathered, I would prepare a detailed statement for the Elm Grove Gazette. In the statement, I would emphasize that the pump selection process was thoroughly documented and that the decision to specify Pumpco equipment was made in consultation with the city's project manager to maintain a positive relationship. I would highlight that the long-term advantages of the Excelsior pumps were originally presented but that, ultimately, the decision was made to go with Pumpco due to immediate cost considerations.

I would also express willingness to work with the city to address the ongoing pump failures and find a satisfactory solution to ensure the effective operation of the wastewater treatment plant. Additionally, I would offer to provide any necessary technical expertise or support to help resolve the current issues with the pumps.

Finally, I would request a follow-up meeting with the city's project manager to discuss the pump failures in detail, assess the current situation, and explore potential solutions moving forward to prevent future incidents.
