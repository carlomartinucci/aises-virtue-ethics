I would thank John Bigge for considering me for the final engineering design of the project. I would express my interest in the opportunity and schedule a meeting with him to discuss the project in more detail. During the meeting, I would inquire about the specific aspects of the project where Weeks and Weeks' recommendations were deemed unrealistic by the planning commission. I would also ask for more details about the project timeline, budget, and any specific requirements that Ramrod Enterprises may have. Based on this information, I would provide John Bigge with a detailed proposal outlining my approach to the final engineering design, highlighting how I can address the concerns raised in the preliminary report and add value to the project.
