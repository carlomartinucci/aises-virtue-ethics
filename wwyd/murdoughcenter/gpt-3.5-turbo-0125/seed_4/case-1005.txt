I would raise my concerns about the situation to the Vice President for Operations. I would explain that while I understand the rationale for reallocating time and charges between the two projects, it is important to maintain transparency and integrity in our billing practices. I would suggest exploring alternative solutions to address the budget shortfall on the Wellfleet project, such as renegotiating the contract or seeking additional funding from the client. I would emphasize the importance of upholding ethical standards and ensuring that our billing practices accurately reflect the work being done on each project.
