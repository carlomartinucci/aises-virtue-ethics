I would schedule a meeting with Chuck Cleaver, the design project manager at Moover, to discuss the situation and express my concerns about the lack of communication and involvement in the project. During the meeting, I would seek clarification on the role of my firm in the ongoing design process and request a detailed explanation of how my team's expertise will be utilized moving forward. I would also inquire about the status of the final contract negotiation and the timeline for our involvement in the project.

If the meeting with Chuck Cleaver does not provide satisfactory answers or if there are continued issues with communication and involvement, I would consider escalating the matter within Moover Design Consultants, Ltd. by reaching out to higher management or the contract administrator to address the situation and ensure that our firm's contributions are valued and appropriately utilized as agreed upon in the initial arrangement.
