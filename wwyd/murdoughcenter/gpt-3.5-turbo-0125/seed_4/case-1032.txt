I would advise Topher to schedule a meeting with the design engineers of the Windsor Ridge development to discuss the potential adverse impacts on the poorer families living south of the development. During this meeting, Topher should express his concerns and work with the engineers to find possible solutions to minimize the negative effects on the community downstream. Topher could suggest modifications to the design or additional mitigation measures that could help address the issues raised. By proactively addressing the concerns and seeking solutions, Topher can demonstrate his commitment to balancing economic growth with the well-being of all residents in Plebian.
