Question 1:
If I accept the assignment from Zeller, I would first evaluate the scope of work required for the project, taking into consideration the complexity of the construction problem, the level of expertise and experience needed, and the potential value of the solution to Zeller Construction. I would then calculate my estimated time and materials costs for providing the engineering solution, factoring in any additional research or modifications needed from the previous project for Hartwell. Finally, I would determine a fair and competitive fee based on these considerations, while also taking into account industry standards and the potential benefits to Zeller Construction.

Question 2:
If contacted by Hartwell to participate with them, I would assess the specific requirements of the project and the level of assistance they are seeking from me. Considering my previous successful collaboration with Hartwell and the potential advantage my expertise could bring to their bid, I would calculate a fee that reflects the value of my contribution to their project. This fee would be based on a fair assessment of the work involved, the potential impact on the project's success, and the market rate for similar services.

Question 3:
If I find out that Hartwell has decided not to bid on the project, my decision on determining the fee may change slightly. In this scenario, since I would not be directly contributing to a bidding process where competition is a factor, I would still consider the value of my expertise and the potential benefits my solution could bring to Zeller Construction. However, I may adjust the fee calculation to reflect the unique circumstances of the situation, such as the lack of competitive pressure from other bidders, while ensuring that the fee remains fair and reasonable for the services provided to Zeller Construction.
