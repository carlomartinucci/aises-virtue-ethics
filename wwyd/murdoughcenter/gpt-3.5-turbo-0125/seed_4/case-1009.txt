I would express my disappointment to Mr. Young about his decision to give the scope of work to a competitor without informing me. I would mention the effort I put into preparing the detailed proposal and emphasize the importance of clear communication and respect for the work done. I would inquire if there was any specific reason he chose to go with the competitor and if there was any aspect of my proposal that was lacking or could be improved upon for future reference. Additionally, I would ask for feedback on how I can better serve his needs in the future to ensure a smoother working relationship.
