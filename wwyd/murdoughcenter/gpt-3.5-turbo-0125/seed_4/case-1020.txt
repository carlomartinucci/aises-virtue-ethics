I would attend the mediation hearing as requested by Noall's attorney to present the technical facts regarding the pile design recommendations made by our firm. I would firmly maintain our position that our firm was not at fault for the issues encountered during the pile driving operations and that the evidence indicates the inferior quality of the pipe used in the piles. I would emphasize that our firm does not bear financial responsibility for the claim and would not participate in any settlement that implies fault on our part. If pressured by Noall or threatened with the revocation of my Professional Engineer's license, I would seek legal advice to understand my rights and options in this situation.
