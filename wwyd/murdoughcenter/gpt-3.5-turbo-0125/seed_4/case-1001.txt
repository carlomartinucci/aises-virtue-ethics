I would advise Turnbuckle to gather all the relevant documentation, including the correspondence with the state Board of Registration for Engineers and Surveyors, the timeline of events, and any other evidence that supports his case. He should consult with a lawyer who specializes in engineering law to understand his legal options and potential defenses against Stout's complaint. Turnbuckle should respond promptly to the formal complaint filed by Stout, providing a detailed explanation of the circumstances and demonstrating that he took appropriate steps to rectify the situation by applying for a professional engineer's license in the state as soon as he realized it was necessary. If needed, he should be prepared to attend any hearings or legal proceedings related to the complaint and cooperate fully with the state Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors.
