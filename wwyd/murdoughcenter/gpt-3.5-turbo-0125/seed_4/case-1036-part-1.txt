I would advise Sam to carefully reconsider the proposed transition plan put forward by Max. It is essential for Sam to take a step back and evaluate the ethical implications and potential consequences of each proposed action. Sam should prioritize maintaining the integrity of the business and treating his employees fairly and with respect.

Sam should also seek advice from a trusted advisor or legal counsel to ensure that all actions taken are legal and ethical. It is crucial for Sam to take the time to thoroughly assess the situation and explore alternative options that do not compromise the values and reputation of In-Line Engineering.

Additionally, Sam should have an open and honest conversation with Max about the concerns and potential risks associated with the proposed plan. Collaboration and transparency between Sam, Max, and other key stakeholders are essential in making informed decisions that align with the best interests of the business and its employees.
