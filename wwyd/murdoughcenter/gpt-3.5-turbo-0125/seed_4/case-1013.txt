I would follow the directive from my manager and issue the final report as revised by the Dewey legal firm. Despite the information I received from the older gentleman at the lunch counter, it has been deemed as hearsay and not reliable for inclusion in the report. Additionally, the client, Americorp, is aware of the alleged contamination and has decided to proceed with the refinancing regardless.

Given the potential consequences outlined by Americorp's attorney, including the loss of financing for a new project and the threat of personal legal action, it is crucial to prioritize the interests of the client and comply with their requests. As my manager has indicated that the client has all the necessary information, issuing the final report as revised by the legal firm would fulfill my obligations and maintain a positive working relationship with both the client and my employer.
