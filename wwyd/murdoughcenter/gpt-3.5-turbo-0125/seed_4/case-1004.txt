I would inform Fulton Adams about the observed relationship between Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert. I would explain that based on the information gathered at the conference and discreet inquiries made afterward, it appears that Cleghorn and Cuthbert are in a personal relationship and living together. I would stress the importance of disclosing this information to the court, as it may raise questions about potential conflicts of interest or bias in Cleghorn's role as an engineering consultant and expert witness for Kinkora Developments. It is essential to ensure transparency and integrity in the legal proceedings, and this new information could be relevant to the case.
