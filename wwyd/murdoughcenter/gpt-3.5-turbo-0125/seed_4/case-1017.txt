Bert should immediately document his discovery of the copied drawings, including any relevant dates, details, and communications with the head draftsperson at Far Horizons. He should then schedule a meeting with his direct supervisor or another appropriate authority within Far Horizons to raise the issue and present his evidence. During the meeting, Bert should express his concerns about the potential unauthorized use of intellectual property from his previous employer, County Line Design, and emphasize the importance of addressing the situation promptly and transparently.

Bert should offer to assist in any further investigation or actions that Far Horizons deems necessary to rectify the situation, such as identifying the source of the copied drawings, reaching out to County Line Design for clarification, or making amends if any infringement has occurred. Throughout the process, Bert should maintain professionalism, integrity, and a focus on resolving the issue in a fair and ethical manner that upholds the intellectual property rights of all involved parties.
