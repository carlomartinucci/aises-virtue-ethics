I would immediately document the incident I witnessed with Mr. Klene pouring water into the monitoring wells in a detailed, written report. I would clearly outline the actions I observed, the implications of those actions on the data and conclusions of the report, and the potential ethical ramifications. 

Next, I would contact my direct supervisor or the appropriate senior management within my firm to inform them of the situation. I would provide them with a copy of the report detailing the incident and discuss the potential impact on the credibility of our findings and the upcoming presentation to the state regulatory agency.

Following this, I would work with my firm's legal counsel to understand the implications of the confidentiality clause in the contract with Industrial Solvents Ltd. I would seek guidance on how to proceed with the information I have uncovered about Mr. Klene's actions and the compromised data in the report.

Finally, I would prepare to meet with Mr. Klene and his legal counsel to address the situation. I would present the evidence I have gathered, express my concerns about the integrity of the data, and discuss the next steps to rectify the situation, ensuring transparency and honesty in all communications moving forward.
