I would reject the settlement offer made by the adjacent property owner. I would instruct my lawyer to continue defending the firm in court, presenting all evidence that shows the firm's advice to the bank regarding obtaining permission for the tiebacks was given both verbally and in writing. I would also ensure that all relevant documentation and correspondence related to the project, including the design report, are provided as evidence to support our position.

In this situation, the adjacent property owner acted unethically by filing a lawsuit against the firm despite being informed by our lawyer that we had advised the bank to obtain the necessary permissions. The bank and the contractor also acted unethically by failing to obtain permission to install the tiebacks on the adjacent property and not following through with the planned abandonment of the tiebacks after construction.

By rejecting the settlement offer and continuing to defend the firm in court, we uphold our integrity and demonstrate that we are not willing to accept responsibility for actions that were not within our control or against our advice.
