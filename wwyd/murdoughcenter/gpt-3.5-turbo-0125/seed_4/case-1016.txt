Question 1:
As the President of Nearby Engineers, I would feel uncomfortable submitting an additional proposal knowing that Trueheart Engineers have already been selected for the project by the Public Works staff. I would view it as going against the principles of fairness and transparency in the selection process. I would consider discussing this concern with the County Public Works Department to seek clarification on the reasons for the change in selection and to ensure that the process is being conducted ethically and according to the initial guidelines.

Question 2:
As a professional engineer on the County Public Works Department staff and a member of the interview/selection team for this project, I would feel a responsibility to uphold the integrity of the selection process. In light of the Director of Public Works overturning the announced QBS selection process and my professional evaluation of the proposed consultants, I would consider raising my concerns with higher authorities within the department or the County Board of Supervisors. I would aim to ensure that the decision-making process is transparent and that the selected consultant is truly the most qualified for the project.

Question 3:
As the Director of Public Works, upon being instructed by a member of the Board of Supervisors to hire Nearby Engineers regardless of the announced QBS selection procedure, I would face a challenging ethical dilemma. In this situation, I would prioritize maintaining the integrity of the selection process and upholding ethical standards. I would consider discussing the situation with the Board of Supervisors to clarify the reasons for their instruction and to emphasize the importance of following established procedures for selecting consultants. If necessary, I would seek guidance from legal counsel to ensure that the decision aligns with ethical and legal standards.

Question 4:
As the President of Trueheart Engineers, after spending considerable professional time refining the scope of work and contract for the project, I would first seek clarification from the County Public Works Department on the reasons for the delay and change in selection. I would also express my concerns about the time and effort invested by my team in the project. Depending on the response and the clarity provided, I would consider discussing potential compensation for the time spent on non-billable work due to the delay in the project. It is important to address this issue professionally and assertively to ensure that the interests of Trueheart Engineers are protected.
