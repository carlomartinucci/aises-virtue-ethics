I would advise Rod to document the instances of the foremen putting gifts in the resident engineer's pickup truck discreetly and accurately. He should then report this information to his supervisor, Jim Upwright, as soon as possible. It is important for Rod to maintain the integrity of the project and ensure that any potential unethical behavior is addressed appropriately.
