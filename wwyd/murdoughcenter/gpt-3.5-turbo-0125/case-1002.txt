I would have expressed my concerns and frustrations to Ralph about the sudden departure and the impact it would have on the rest of the team. I would have also sought clarification on the future plans for the Omaha office and how the transition would be managed to ensure minimal disruption to ongoing projects and client relationships. Additionally, I would have considered discussing the situation with the management at Gamma Group to provide feedback on the handling of the situation and to seek guidance on next steps for the team.
