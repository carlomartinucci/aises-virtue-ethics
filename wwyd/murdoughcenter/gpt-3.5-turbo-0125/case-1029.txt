I would recommend that Clayton explore alternative options to support Eleanor during this difficult time. One specific action he could take is to investigate the possibility of temporarily reassigning Eleanor to a role within the Public Works department that better aligns with her current capabilities and energy levels. This could involve adjusting her responsibilities to better suit her health and personal circumstances while still allowing her to contribute meaningfully to the team. By finding a more suitable position for Eleanor, Clayton can demonstrate compassion and support for her loyal service while also ensuring the efficient operation of the department.
