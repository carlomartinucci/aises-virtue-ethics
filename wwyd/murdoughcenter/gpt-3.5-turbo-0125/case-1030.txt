Reilly should conduct further research and investigation to verify whether the existing treatment room is truly explosion proof according to the NFPA 820 code requirements. He should consult with a qualified fire safety expert or an inspector to assess the room's compliance with the code. If there are doubts about the room's safety, Reilly should document his findings and concerns in writing and present them to Dante and the project manager at SGOH. It is important for Reilly to prioritize the safety and compliance of the wastewater treatment plant, even if it may lead to additional project delays or costs.
