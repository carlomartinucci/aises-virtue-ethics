I would express my concerns to the Vice President for Operations about the ethical implications of charging my time to the Excaliber project while working primarily on the Wellfleet project. I would request a meeting to discuss the situation further and propose potential solutions, such as reallocating resources or renegotiating the budget for the Wellfleet project. If necessary, I would escalate the issue to higher management or the company's ethics committee to ensure transparency and fairness in project billing.
