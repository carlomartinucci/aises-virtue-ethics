I would advise Carlos to prioritize the safety and well-being of the workers above all else. He should not compromise on safety measures and should push for the hiring of qualified workers to complete the tank construction. Carlos should also advocate for legalizing the Ecuadorian workers to ensure they have access to worker compensation benefits and medical insurance.

In this situation, Carlos should document his concerns and recommendations in writing to his boss, emphasizing the importance of safety on the construction site and the potential risks associated with using unqualified workers. He should also seek support from any relevant regulatory bodies or labor unions to address the issue of hiring illegal immigrants and ensure proper working conditions for all workers involved in the project.

Ultimately, Carlos should stand firm in his commitment to ethical practices and worker safety, even if it means risking his chances of getting a permanent contract with the firm. It is important to prioritize the well-being of the workers and uphold ethical standards in the workplace.
