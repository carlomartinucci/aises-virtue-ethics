Question 1:
As the President of Nearby Engineers, I would feel conflicted about submitting an additional proposal knowing that Trueheart Engineers have already been selected for the project by the Public Works staff. I would carefully consider the ethical implications of potentially undermining the selection process and the trust of the Public Works Department. I would also assess the potential impact on our reputation and relationships within the community. Ultimately, I would prioritize transparency and integrity in my decision-making process.

Question 2:
As a professional engineer on the County Public Works Department staff and a member of the interview/selection team for this project, I would feel a responsibility to uphold the integrity of the selection process. In light of the Director of Public Works overturning the announced QBS selection process and professional evaluation of the proposed consultants, I would consider raising my concerns with higher authorities within the department or seeking guidance from relevant professional organizations on how to address this situation.

Question 3:
As the Director of Public Works, upon being instructed by a member of the Board of Supervisors to hire Nearby Engineers regardless of the announced QBS selection procedure, I would carefully evaluate the situation. I would consider the ethical implications of disregarding the established selection process and the potential consequences for the department's credibility. I would also assess the legal and professional obligations involved. Depending on the circumstances, I may choose to push back against the directive, seek clarification from the Board of Supervisors, or consider resigning from my position if I feel unable to uphold the principles of fairness and transparency.

Question 4:
As the President of Trueheart Engineers, after investing considerable professional time in refining the scope of work and contract for the project, I would first seek clarification from the County Public Works Department on the reasons for the delayed contract approval and the subsequent change in selection. I would aim to understand the situation fully before deciding on the appropriate course of action. Depending on the circumstances and the impact on our firm, I may consider discussing the matter with legal counsel, raising concerns with relevant professional organizations, or exploring options for recourse to address any potential unfair treatment.
