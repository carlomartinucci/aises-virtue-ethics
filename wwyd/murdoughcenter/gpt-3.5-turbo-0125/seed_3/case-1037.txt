I would document the information about Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert's relationship that I have discreetly gathered after returning to my city. This information could potentially be relevant to the case at hand, as it may impact Cleghorn's objectivity and credibility as an engineering consultant and expert witness for Kinkora Developments. I would inform Fulton Adams about what I have discovered and provide him with the documented information for his consideration in the legal proceedings. It is important to ensure that all relevant information is brought to light for a fair and just resolution of the case.
