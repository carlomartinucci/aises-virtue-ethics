Question 1:
If I accept the assignment from Zeller, I would first review the scope of work required for the project and assess the level of complexity involved. I would then calculate the estimated time and resources needed to develop a similar engineering solution to the previous project for Hartwell. Based on this assessment, I would determine a fair and competitive fee that reflects the value of my expertise and the potential cost savings or profit generation for Zeller Construction Inc. I would also take into consideration market rates for similar services in the local area to ensure that my fee is reasonable and competitive.

Question 2:
If contacted by Hartwell to participate with them, I would consider the nature of my previous work for them and the successful outcome of the project. I would assess the level of trust and relationship built with Hartwell over the years and factor in the potential benefits for both parties in collaborating again. Based on these considerations, I would negotiate a fee that is fair and aligns with the value I can bring to the project, taking into account the potential profits that could be generated for Hartwell Construction.

Question 3:
If I find out that Hartwell has decided not to bid on the project, I would reassess the situation and consider the implications of this decision on my potential involvement with Zeller Construction Inc. Knowing that Hartwell is not a direct competitor in this case, I would take this into consideration when determining my fee for working with Zeller. I would still base my fee on the value of my expertise and the potential benefits for Zeller, while also factoring in the reduced competitive pressure from Hartwell in the bidding process.
