I would schedule a meeting with the design engineers responsible for the Windsor Ridge development to discuss the potential adverse impacts on the downstream community. I would ask them to explore alternative design options that could mitigate or minimize these impacts while still meeting all codes and regulations. Additionally, I would request a thorough analysis of the secondary impacts, such as increased traffic and drainage modifications, to fully understand the implications on the affected families and the environment. It is important to consider the well-being of all residents in Plebian and find a solution that balances economic benefits with social and environmental responsibilities.
