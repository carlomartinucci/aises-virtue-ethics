I would first gather all the information I have heard from Ted, Alice, and my wife about the potential conflicts of interest involving Shreud Contractors, the construction projects at the university, and the University Architect. 

Next, I would schedule a meeting with the Vice President for Finance, who oversees the University Architect, to discuss the concerns raised about the potential conflicts of interest in the construction projects. I would present the specific details shared with me and express my concerns about the integrity of the process.

During the meeting, I would emphasize the importance of transparency, fair competition, and ethical practices in awarding contracts for university projects. I would also offer to provide any additional information or assistance in investigating the matter further.

Lastly, I would follow up with the University President to inform them about the situation and the actions I have taken to address the potential conflicts of interest. I would stress the need for accountability and ethical standards in the university's construction projects to maintain the trust of the community and stakeholders.
