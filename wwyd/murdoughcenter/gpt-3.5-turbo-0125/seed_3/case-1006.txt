I would first review the company's policies and employee handbook to see if there are any guidelines regarding political contributions or conflicts of interest. If there are no specific policies in place, I would schedule a meeting with HR to discuss the situation and seek guidance on how to proceed ethically and in alignment with company values. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about the potential pressure to make political contributions and seek advice on how to handle the situation professionally. I would document the conversation and any advice given by HR for my records.
