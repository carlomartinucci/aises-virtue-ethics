I would advise Turnbuckle to gather all relevant documentation regarding his engineering qualifications and experience, including his registration in 17 other states. He should prepare a detailed response to the state Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors, emphasizing his extensive experience and expertise in engineering. Turnbuckle should also provide evidence of the urgent nature of the clock tower incident and the need for immediate action to avert a potential disaster. Additionally, he should seek legal counsel to understand his rights and options in responding to Stout's complaint. It would be advisable for Turnbuckle to cooperate fully with the board's investigation and provide any additional information or clarification they may request.
