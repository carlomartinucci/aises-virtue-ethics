I would firmly reiterate the potential long-term risks associated with using shallow spread footings instead of piles as the foundation for the office structures. I would explain in detail the specific consequences that could arise from settlements over time, such as cracking of floor slabs, differential movement of the second stories, and distress to the building exteriors. I would emphasize that these issues may not become apparent until several years after construction is completed, well beyond the warranty period.

I would then offer to provide a written addendum to the report outlining the risks and implications of not following the recommended foundation design. I would make it clear that my professional recommendation is to use pile foundations to mitigate these risks and ensure the long-term stability of the structures. I would also mention that compromising on the foundation design could lead to costly repairs and structural issues in the future, impacting the overall integrity and value of the buildings.

If the contractor still insists on using shallow footings despite my professional advice, I would document the communication and decision-making process thoroughly. I would make sure that all correspondence, including my warnings and recommendations, are clearly documented in writing. I would also consult with my supervisor or legal team within the company to discuss the situation and determine the best course of action to protect the integrity of the geotechnical engineering services provided.
