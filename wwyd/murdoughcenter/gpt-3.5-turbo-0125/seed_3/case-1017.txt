Bert should gather all relevant information and evidence regarding the situation, including the specific details of the drawings in question, any communication or documentation related to the previous subcontracting work, and the policies or agreements in place between his former and current employers. 

Next, Bert should schedule a meeting with his immediate supervisor or a higher-up within Far Horizons Engineering to discuss his concerns in a professional and non-confrontational manner. During the meeting, Bert should present his findings and express his belief that the drawings in question may have been taken without proper authorization from his previous employer.

Bert should propose conducting a thorough investigation into the origins of the drawings, involving relevant parties from both companies if necessary. He should emphasize the importance of upholding ethical standards in the engineering profession and ensuring that intellectual property rights are respected.

Depending on the outcome of the investigation, Bert should be prepared to cooperate with any corrective measures or actions that Far Horizons Engineering deems appropriate, whether it involves rectifying the situation with his former employer, implementing new policies to prevent similar incidents in the future, or any other steps to uphold integrity and professionalism within the company.
