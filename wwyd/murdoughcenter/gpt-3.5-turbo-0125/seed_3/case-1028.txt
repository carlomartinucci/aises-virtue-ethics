I would not take advantage of the option provided by Creative Communications Corporation (CCC) to add an internal markup to the long-distance telephone charges billed to clients. Instead, I would continue to bill clients for these expenses at actual cost without adding any markup. This approach aligns with the common practice in the industry where clients expect to be billed for reimbursable expenses without any additional markups for overhead costs. Additionally, maintaining transparency in billing practices by passing on actual costs to clients helps build trust and credibility in client relationships.
