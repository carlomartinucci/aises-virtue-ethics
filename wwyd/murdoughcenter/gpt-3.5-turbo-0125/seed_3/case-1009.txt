I would express my disappointment to Mr. Young for not informing me about his decision to hire a competitor despite receiving my detailed proposal. I would respectfully remind him of the effort and expertise put into preparing the scope of work and cost estimate for the foundation investigation. I would also inquire about the reasons behind his choice to go with a competitor, seeking feedback on how I could improve my proposals in the future to better meet his needs. Finally, I would wish him success with the project and express my willingness to collaborate on future opportunities.
