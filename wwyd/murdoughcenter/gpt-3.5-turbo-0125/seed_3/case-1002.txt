If I were one of the engineers in the Gamma Group Omaha office in this situation, I would have taken a step back to assess the situation objectively. I would have considered the potential impact of Ralph and Dorph leaving on the office and its employees. I would have also evaluated my own career goals and professional values to determine the best course of action for myself.

Regarding Ralph's actions, I would feel that his sudden departure without proper communication or transition planning was unprofessional and disruptive to the office. His wife's involvement in persuading other employees to leave for Compass Associates raises ethical concerns about potential conflict of interest and manipulation.
