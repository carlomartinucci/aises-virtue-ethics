In the morning, I would decide to be transparent with Bill Broot about the cost estimate for the new project site. I would inform him that based on the reuse of information and analyses from the Dawson site, the estimated cost for the new project would be $22,800. I would explain the breakdown of the estimate and highlight the cost savings achieved by leveraging existing resources. Additionally, I would emphasize the importance of staying within budget constraints to ensure a successful project outcome for both parties.
