Reilly should conduct a thorough inspection of the existing treatment room to verify whether it meets the requirements to be classified as explosion proof according to the NFPA 820 code. This inspection should focus on the electrical sockets, light switches, lighting fixtures, and junction boxes to ensure they are compliant with the necessary standards. If Reilly finds that the room does not meet the requirements for explosion-proof classification, he should document his findings and present them to Dante and the project manager, emphasizing the importance of addressing this issue to ensure the safety and compliance of the facility. Reilly should also suggest potential solutions or next steps to rectify the situation, such as bringing in a qualified expert to assess and upgrade the room if needed. It is crucial for Reilly to prioritize the safety and legal compliance of the wastewater treatment plant, even if it means facing potential challenges and discomfort in addressing the issue with the relevant stakeholders.
