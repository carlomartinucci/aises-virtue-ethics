I would report my observations and findings regarding Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert's living situation to Fulton Adams, the attorney assigned to the case by Wastewater Treatment's insurance company. I would explain the potential conflict of interest that could arise due to their personal relationship, and how it may impact the fairness and objectivity of Cleghorn's testimony as an engineering consultant and expert witness for Kinkora Developments. It is important to ensure transparency and integrity in the legal proceedings, and addressing this issue promptly with the legal team would be the appropriate course of action.
