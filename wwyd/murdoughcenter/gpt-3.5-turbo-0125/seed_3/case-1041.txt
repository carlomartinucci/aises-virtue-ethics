Carlos should prioritize the safety and well-being of the workers on the construction site. He should not compromise on safety standards and should take immediate action to address the concerns regarding the lack of experience of the Ecuadorian workers in working with concrete.

To ensure the safety of the workers and the successful completion of the project, Carlos should take the following specific actions:

1. Implement additional safety measures on the construction site, such as providing proper safety equipment, training the workers on safe construction practices, and conducting regular safety inspections.

2. Seek out qualified workers with experience in working with concrete to assist the Ecuadorian workers in completing the tank construction safely and correctly.

3. Advocate for legalizing the Ecuadorian workers to ensure they are eligible for worker compensation benefits and other necessary protections.

4. Communicate openly and transparently with his boss about the safety concerns and the need for additional resources to ensure the successful completion of the project.

By taking these specific actions, Carlos can uphold his ethical responsibility to prioritize the safety of the workers while also working towards the successful completion of the project.
