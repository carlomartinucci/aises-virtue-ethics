I would immediately gather all relevant documentation, such as Chuck's note, my own notes, and any communication records with Chuck regarding the site visit and the samples collected. I would secure the samples I collected in the ice chest and label them clearly with the date and location of collection. Next, I would contact a senior member of the management team at Everclere Consultants, Inc. to report the situation, providing all the details and evidence I have gathered. I would emphasize the potential environmental risks posed by the drums and the urgency of the matter. Finally, I would follow the guidance and instructions provided by the management team on how to proceed, ensuring that the proper authorities are informed and that the hazardous waste is handled and disposed of correctly.
