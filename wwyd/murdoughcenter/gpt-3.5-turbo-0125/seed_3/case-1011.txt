I would thank John Bigge for considering me for the final engineering design of the project. I would express my interest in working on the project and ask for a meeting to discuss the details further. During the meeting, I would inquire about the specific concerns raised by Weeks and Weeks in their preliminary report and discuss how my approach to the project would differ. I would also request access to all relevant project documentation to conduct a thorough review before providing a proposal for the final engineering design services.
