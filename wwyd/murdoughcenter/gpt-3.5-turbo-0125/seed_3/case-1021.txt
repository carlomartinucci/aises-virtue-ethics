I would not authorize the exclusive involvement of International Affiliates Ltd. for obtaining the project with Obigee Oil Unlimited in Utopia. Instead, I would conduct further research to explore alternative options for establishing a local presence in Utopia. This could involve reaching out to other reputable firms recommended by different sources, reviewing their credentials, and negotiating more favorable terms that align better with Choice Engineering's budget and ethical standards. Additionally, I would seek guidance from internal stakeholders within Choice Engineering to ensure a transparent and ethical decision-making process.
