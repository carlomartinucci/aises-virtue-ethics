I would first gather all relevant documentation related to the selection of the pumps, including emails, meeting minutes, and project reports. I would review these documents to understand the decision-making process and rationale behind choosing the Pumpco pumps over the Excelsior pumps.

Next, I would schedule a meeting with my project engineer, Florence Moore, to discuss the situation. I would seek her input on the performance issues with the Pumpco pumps and whether she believes the decision to go with Pumpco over Excelsior was the right one given the current problems.

Following that, I would reach out to the city's project manager, Dee Taylor, to discuss the pump failures and gather her perspective on the situation. I would inquire about any maintenance issues or other factors that may have contributed to the repeated failures.

Based on the information gathered from these discussions, I would draft a carefully worded statement for the Elm Grove Gazette. In the statement, I would acknowledge the pump failures, provide a brief overview of the decision-making process that led to the selection of the Pumpco pumps, and express our commitment to working with the city to address the current issues.

Additionally, I would offer to send a team of engineers to Elm Grove to investigate the pump failures in person and provide recommendations for resolving the issues. I would emphasize our dedication to ensuring the successful operation of the treatment plant and our willingness to collaborate with the city to find a solution.

Lastly, I would ensure that all communication with the Elm Grove Gazette is handled professionally and transparently, with a focus on finding a resolution to the pump failures while maintaining a positive working relationship with the city and its officials.
