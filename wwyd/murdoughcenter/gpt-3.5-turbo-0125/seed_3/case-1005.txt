I would raise my concerns about the situation to the Vice President for Operations. I would explain that charging time to one project while working on another could potentially lead to ethical issues and misrepresentation of billing. I would suggest that a more transparent and appropriate solution would be to allocate resources and time according to the actual projects being worked on, ensuring accurate billing and accountability. If needed, I would also propose discussing the situation with the clients involved to provide clarity and maintain integrity in our work.
