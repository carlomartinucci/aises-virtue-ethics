I would schedule a meeting with the president of Global Engineering and Construction to discuss the situation with Roy and the potential conflict of interest involving Hotspark Electrical Co. During the meeting, I would present the observations I have made regarding Roy's interactions with the young woman who is a major figure at Hotspark. I would express my concerns about the possibility of preferential treatment and compromises in the quality of work being provided by Hotspark.

I would also highlight the importance of maintaining the firm's integrity and ensuring that all business dealings are conducted ethically and transparently. I would seek guidance from the president on how to handle the situation effectively given Roy's seniority and the potential impact on the firm's projects.

Additionally, I would propose implementing a review process for subcontractor relationships to prevent any conflicts of interest in the future. I would emphasize the need for clear guidelines and accountability to uphold the firm's reputation and standards of excellence in all projects.

Overall, I would take proactive steps to address the issue, seek advice from higher management, and work towards safeguarding the firm's interests and reputation.
