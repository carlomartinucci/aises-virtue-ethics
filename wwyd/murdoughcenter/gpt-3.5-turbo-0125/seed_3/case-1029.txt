I would recommend that Clayton explore alternative options to support Eleanor during this difficult time. Clayton could consider proposing a temporary reassignment for Eleanor within the department that better aligns with her current capabilities and allows her to contribute meaningfully without causing resentment among other employees. This could help retain Eleanor's employment while addressing the concerns raised by Allan regarding her current role. Clayton could also explore the possibility of providing additional support to help Eleanor manage her personal and health challenges while still being able to work in a capacity that is suitable for her present circumstances. This approach would demonstrate compassion towards Eleanor while also addressing the department's operational needs.
