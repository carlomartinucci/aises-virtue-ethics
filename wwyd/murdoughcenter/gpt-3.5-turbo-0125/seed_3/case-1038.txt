Daulton should not manipulate the plat to hide the ownership of the undeveloped property by Elias and Shellie's joint venture. Instead, he should immediately confront Elias and Shellie about their failure to disclose their ownership interest in the property. Daulton should express his concerns about the potential conflict of interest and the ethical implications of their actions. He should request that Elias and Shellie rectify the situation by making a full disclosure to all relevant parties, including ClearWater Developers, Walbert Township, and any other stakeholders involved in the project. Daulton should also consider seeking advice from legal counsel to determine the best course of action to address this ethical dilemma in a transparent and responsible manner.
