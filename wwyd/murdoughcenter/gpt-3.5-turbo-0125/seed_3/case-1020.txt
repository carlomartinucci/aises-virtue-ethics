I would attend the mediation hearing as requested by Noall's attorney. During the mediation, I would present the technical evidence uncovered by my firm regarding the faulty pipe used in the piles and the correct pile design recommendations made by my firm. I would emphasize that my firm was not allowed to be present during the pile driving to address any field issues that arose and that we do not feel financially obligated to contribute to the settlement. I would maintain my stance that the responsibility lies with the contractor and Noall's field inspector, who did not address the problems during construction. I would uphold the integrity of my firm's work and stand by the technical evidence provided.
