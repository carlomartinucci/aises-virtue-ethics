Jack should immediately contact the drilling crew and geologist who were responsible for the subsurface explorations at the site of the proposed office building complex. He should request a detailed explanation of the drilling operations, inquire about the specific locations of the borings, and ask for any additional information or documentation that can help verify the accuracy of the subsurface exploration logs and data. Jack should also request the crew to provide any photographs or field notes taken during the drilling process to help identify the exact locations of the borings.

In parallel, Jack should conduct a thorough review of the existing data provided by the drill crew and geologist to identify any inconsistencies or gaps that may have led to the confusion regarding the location of the borings. He should also review any relevant project documents, maps, or reports to cross-reference the information and ensure the accuracy of the data.

Furthermore, Jack should consider engaging an independent third-party geotechnical expert to conduct a site visit and verify the subsurface conditions at the proposed building complex. This additional verification step can help mitigate any potential risks associated with relying solely on the existing data provided by the drill crew and geologist.

Finally, Jack should communicate transparently with the client about the situation, informing them of the challenges faced in verifying the subsurface exploration data and providing assurances that all necessary steps are being taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the foundation design recommendation report. He should also discuss any potential delays in the submission of the report and work towards finding a mutually agreeable solution with the client to meet their project timeline while upholding professional standards of accuracy and diligence.
