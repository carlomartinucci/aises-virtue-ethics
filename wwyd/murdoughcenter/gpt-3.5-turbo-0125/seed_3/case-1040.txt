Ethan should immediately schedule a meeting with Marc to discuss his concerns about the field changes that have been authorized. During the meeting, Ethan should present his reasoning for why he believes the electronics hardware substitutions are inferior and how they could potentially impact the quality of the project. Ethan should express his commitment to designing a high-quality project and maintaining the trust of EDOT.

Ethan should propose a thorough review process for any future field changes, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and agreement between both parties to ensure that any modifications align with the project's original design intent. Ethan should also suggest revisiting the TE/STI partnership agreement to address how design conflicts should be resolved in a fair and transparent manner.

Additionally, Ethan should reiterate the importance of upholding professional standards and ethical responsibilities in delivering the project to EDOT. By openly addressing his concerns with Marc and seeking a mutual understanding and resolution, Ethan can demonstrate his commitment to delivering a successful project while prioritizing quality and integrity.
