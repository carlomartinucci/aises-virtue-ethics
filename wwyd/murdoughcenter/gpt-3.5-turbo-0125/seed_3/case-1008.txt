I would immediately contact my supervisor and the legal department within my firm to inform them of the situation. I would provide a detailed account of what I witnessed at the Industrial Solvents site, including Mr. Klene's actions of tampering with the monitoring wells to manipulate the groundwater samples.

I would request an emergency meeting with the legal team and senior management to discuss the implications of this discovery on our report and presentation to the state regulatory agency. I would emphasize the need for transparency and ethical conduct in handling this situation.

I would also recommend suspending the presentation to the state agency until a thorough investigation can be conducted internally to determine the extent of the data manipulation and its impact on our findings. Additionally, I would suggest reviewing the confidentiality clause in our contract with Industrial Solvents Ltd. to understand our obligations in this situation.

Overall, my immediate priority would be to ensure that the integrity of our work and reputation is upheld, even if it means delaying the presentation and potentially facing legal repercussions.
