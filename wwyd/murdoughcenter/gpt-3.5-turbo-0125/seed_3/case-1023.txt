I would schedule a meeting with Chuck Cleaver, the project manager at Moover Design Consultants, to discuss the situation. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about the lack of communication and the unexpected change in the level of involvement of my firm in the project. I would seek clarification on the role my firm is expected to play moving forward and address the discrepancy between the initial agreement and the current situation. I would also inquire about the reasons for the apparent shift in approach and discuss the importance of maintaining open and transparent communication throughout the project. Additionally, I would emphasize the value that my firm can bring to the project and advocate for a more collaborative and mutually beneficial working relationship.
