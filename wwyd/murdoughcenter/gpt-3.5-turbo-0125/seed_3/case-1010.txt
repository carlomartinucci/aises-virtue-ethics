I would advise Julie to consult with other structural engineers in her firm to verify the accuracy of Brock's findings regarding the rusted clip angles on the exterior granite veneer of the Inverness Block. It is crucial to gather multiple expert opinions to ensure the validity of the discovery before taking any further action. Once confirmed, Julie should document these findings and present them to Charles Smith along with a recommendation for immediate action to address the safety concerns posed by the corroded clip angles. It is essential for Julie to prioritize the safety of the building occupants and pedestrians over potential business relationships.
