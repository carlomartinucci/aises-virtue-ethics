I would first gather all the identical project reports and make copies of them as evidence. Then, I would schedule individual meetings with each of the seven students who submitted the identical reports to discuss the situation. During the meetings, I would confront the students with the evidence and ask them to explain why their reports are identical. I would listen to their explanations and assess the credibility of their responses.

Based on the information gathered from the meetings, I would then make a decision on how to address the situation. This could involve giving the students an opportunity to resubmit new, original project reports within a specified timeframe, with appropriate penalties for academic dishonesty. I would also explain the consequences of academic dishonesty and emphasize the importance of integrity in academic work.

After resolving the issue with the students, I would grade the new project reports accordingly and submit the grade reports by the deadline. I would document the entire process, including the evidence of the identical reports, the meetings with the students, and the actions taken to address the academic dishonesty. If necessary, I would seek guidance from colleagues or university policies on handling academic misconduct cases.
