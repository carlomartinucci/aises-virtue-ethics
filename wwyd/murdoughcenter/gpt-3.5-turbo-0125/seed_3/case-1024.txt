I would advise Rod to report the suspicious activity he has observed to the appropriate authorities within the Department of Transportation (DOT). Specifically, he should bring this information to the attention of Ethel Hicks, who is Jim Upwright's supervisor at the DOT headquarters. Rod should do this as soon as possible to ensure that the integrity of the project and the evaluation process is maintained.
