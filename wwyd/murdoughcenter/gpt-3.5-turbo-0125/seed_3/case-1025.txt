I would refuse the settlement offer from the adjacent property owner and continue to assert the firm's position that it was not responsible for the alleged damages. I would work closely with our lawyer to present all evidence demonstrating that we had advised the bank and its project manager to obtain the necessary permission for installing the tiebacks and anchors on the adjacent property. It is important to emphasize that the responsibility for obtaining permission rested with the bank and its contractors, not with our firm.

Additionally, I would work with our lawyer to prepare a strong defense for the upcoming trial in court. We would present all documentation showing that we fulfilled our obligation by advising the bank of the necessary permissions. We would also highlight the actions taken by the bank and the contractor in installing the tiebacks without obtaining proper permission, emphasizing that they were the ones who acted unethically in this situation.

Ultimately, I would stand firm in our position, continue to defend the firm's integrity, and proceed with the legal process to address the allegations made against us.
