Gwen should address her concerns directly with Lawrence by requesting a private meeting to discuss the potential implications and ethical considerations of accessing employees' email files without their consent. She should express her belief that this action could breach employee privacy and trust, potentially leading to negative outcomes such as employee turnover or legal issues. Gwen should offer alternative solutions to help address the issue of inappropriate email use, such as implementing training sessions on email etiquette or reinforcing the company's email policy through clear communication and reminders. By engaging in a respectful and constructive dialogue with Lawrence, Gwen can work towards finding a more ethical and effective solution to the situation.
