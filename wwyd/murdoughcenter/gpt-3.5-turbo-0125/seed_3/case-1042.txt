I would suggest that Rashid document his observations and concerns regarding the potential problem with the steel beam coating. He should gather all relevant information, such as the specifications, his own observations, and any conversations he had with Gibb or others on the site.

Next, Rashid should schedule a meeting with Riley to present his findings and express his concerns in a clear and professional manner. During the meeting, Rashid should focus on the importance of quality control and adherence to specifications for the safety and integrity of the structure being built. He should also emphasize the potential risks of overlooking the coating issue, both in terms of safety and project quality.

Rashid should propose possible solutions or actions that can be taken to address the problem, such as requesting a re-inspection of the affected beams or involving higher management in the decision-making process. He should remain firm in his stance on the importance of ensuring quality workmanship on the project.

Lastly, Rashid should follow up with Riley to ensure that the issue is being addressed and that appropriate actions are being taken to rectify any potential deficiencies in the coating process. By taking a proactive approach and advocating for quality and safety, Rashid can demonstrate his commitment to his job and the well-being of the construction project.
