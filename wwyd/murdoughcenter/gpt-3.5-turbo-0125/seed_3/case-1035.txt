Robert should schedule a meeting with his boss/office manager, James, to discuss his concerns about the project. He should explain the discrepancies between his geotechnical recommendations and the actual foundation construction, emphasizing the potential risks and liabilities associated with the current approach. Robert should propose that the firm consider reaching out to Walker and Larry to offer further guidance and assistance to ensure the successful completion of the remaining structures on the project. Additionally, Robert should suggest implementing a quality control monitoring plan for the ongoing construction activities to mitigate any potential issues that may arise in the future.
