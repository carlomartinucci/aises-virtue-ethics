Question 1:
As the President of Nearby Engineers, I would feel conflicted about submitting an additional proposal when Trueheart Engineers have already been selected for the project by the Public Works staff. I would carefully consider the ethical implications of potentially undermining the established selection process and the trust of the County Public Works Department. I would consult with my team and legal advisors to assess the situation thoroughly before making a decision on whether to submit an additional proposal.

Question 2:
As a professional engineer on the County Public Works Department staff and a member of the interview/selection team, I would be concerned about the Director of Public Works overturning the announced QBS selection process and my professional evaluation of the proposed consultants. I would raise my concerns with the appropriate authorities within the department, such as the department head or an ethics committee, to ensure that the selection process is fair and transparent. It is important to uphold the integrity of the selection process and ensure that the best interests of the project and the community are served.

Question 3:
As the Director of Public Works, if I have been instructed by a member of the Board of Supervisors to hire Nearby Engineers regardless of the announced QBS selection procedure, I would ethically and professionally push back against this directive. I would communicate the importance of following the established selection process to the Board of Supervisors and advocate for the integrity of the selection process. It is crucial to uphold ethical standards and ensure that decisions are made in the best interest of the project and the community.

Question 4:
As the President of Trueheart Engineers, I would be disappointed by the situation where our selection for the project was overturned after investing time in refining the scope of work and contract. To address this, I would request a debriefing meeting with the County Public Works Department to understand the reasons behind the change in decision. I would also seek feedback on our proposal to identify areas for improvement in future submissions. Additionally, I would review our internal processes to streamline future proposal preparations to minimize the impact on billable work for other projects.
