Roger should express his concerns more firmly to his boss, Bill Mason, emphasizing the potential ethical issues of providing a draft of the report to Frank Bullock before it is finalized and submitted to the client, the Downing Flood Control District. He should request further clarification on how the firm handles such situations to ensure transparency and integrity in their dealings with clients. Additionally, Roger should ask for guidance on how to handle similar requests in the future to avoid any potential conflicts of interest.
