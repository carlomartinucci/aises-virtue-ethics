I would advise Dianne to stick to the original design that avoids impacting the old water main, as per State DOT policy. She should prioritize integrity and adherence to the rules and regulations set forth by the department. Dianne should not succumb to any pressure to deviate from the standard procedures, even if it means potentially jeopardizing her PE license recommendation or facing any other consequences. It is essential for her to act ethically and professionally in this situation, putting the interests of the State DOT and the citizens of Shadyvale above personal considerations.
