I would advise Sam to take a step back and carefully consider the ethical implications of the proposed transition plan. Sam should prioritize honesty, transparency, and integrity in all business dealings. It is important for Sam to ensure that any actions taken are legal, ethical, and in the best interests of all stakeholders, including employees and clients. Sam should seek guidance from legal and financial advisors to explore alternative strategies for saving the business without compromising ethical standards. Additionally, Sam should have open and honest communication with all employees, including Cal, about the challenges facing the company and work together to find a solution that aligns with ethical values.
