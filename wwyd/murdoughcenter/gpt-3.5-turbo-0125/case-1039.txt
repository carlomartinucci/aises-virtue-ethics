I would immediately gather all the documentation related to the sampling of the drums, including the notes, chain-of-custody records, and any communication with Chuck regarding the samples. I would then schedule a meeting with Chuck to discuss the discrepancy between the information provided to Shariq and the actions taken by the remediation contractor. During the meeting, I would present the evidence and express my concerns about the potential misrepresentation of the sampling results to the client.

I would emphasize the importance of maintaining integrity and transparency in our work, especially when it comes to environmental assessments that could have significant implications for public health and safety. I would suggest that we rectify the situation by conducting proper testing of the drum contents to ensure accurate information is provided to the client and regulatory authorities.

If Chuck is unwilling to address the issue or attempts to dismiss my concerns, I would escalate the matter to higher management within Everclere Consultants, Inc. or report it to the appropriate regulatory agencies to ensure that the proper steps are taken to handle the situation ethically and in compliance with the law.
