Robert should schedule a meeting with his boss/office manager, James, to discuss his concerns about the project. He should present the details of what he observed on site, including the over-designed foundation and the lack of proper implementation of his geotechnical recommendations. Robert should emphasize the potential risks and liabilities that the project may face due to these issues. He should propose a plan to address the situation, such as reaching out to Walker and Larry to discuss the discrepancies and offer solutions to improve the construction process moving forward. Robert should also suggest providing additional guidance or oversight to ensure that future construction phases are executed in a more efficient and cost-effective manner.
