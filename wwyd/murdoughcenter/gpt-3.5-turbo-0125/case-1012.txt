I would first gather all relevant documentation related to the selection of the pumps, including any correspondence, meeting minutes, and project specifications that detail the decision-making process. 

Next, I would schedule a meeting with my project engineer, Florence Moore, to discuss the situation and review the reasons why Excelsior Pumps were initially specified over Pumpco. I would ask Flo to provide a detailed explanation of the advantages and long-term benefits of using Excelsior pumps, as well as any data or case studies supporting their reliability and cost-effectiveness.

Following this, I would reach out to the city's project manager, Dee Taylor, to arrange a meeting to address the pump failures and discuss the decision to switch to Pumpco equipment. During the meeting, I would present the documentation and rationale behind the selection of Excelsior pumps, emphasizing the potential benefits that were considered at the time. I would also inquire about the specific issues that led to the repeated failures of the Pumpco pumps and explore potential solutions to rectify the situation.

Finally, I would prepare a statement for the Elm Grove Gazette that outlines the decision-making process regarding the pump selection, highlighting the factors that were taken into consideration and the rationale behind the final choice. I would express willingness to work with the city to address the current pump failures and ensure the long-term success of the treatment plant.
