I would first gather all relevant documentation and correspondence related to the project, including the initial agreement with Moover Design Consultants, the scope of work, estimated fee, and any communication with them.

Next, I would schedule a meeting with my firm's legal team to review the contract with Moover Design Consultants and discuss potential courses of action. It is important to understand our rights and obligations under the contract, as well as any potential legal recourse available to us.

Following the legal consultation, I would reach out to Moover Design Consultants in writing, expressing my concerns about the lack of communication and the discrepancy between the initial agreement and the current situation. I would request a meeting to discuss the project status, our role in the design process, and any issues that need to be addressed.

During the meeting with Moover Design Consultants, I would clearly outline our expectations regarding communication, collaboration, and the distribution of work on the project. I would seek clarification on their intentions moving forward and ensure that our firm's expertise and contributions are valued and utilized appropriately.

If the meeting with Moover Design Consultants does not result in a satisfactory resolution or if there are continued issues with communication and collaboration, I would consider escalating the matter to the agency funding the project or seeking legal advice on potential remedies available to us.

Overall, my goal would be to protect our firm's interests, ensure fair treatment in the project partnership, and seek a mutually beneficial resolution to any issues that have arisen.
