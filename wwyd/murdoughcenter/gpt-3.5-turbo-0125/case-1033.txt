Dianne should adhere to the State DOT policy and continue with the original design that avoids impacting the old water main in Shadyvale. She should not make any changes to the design that would require the State DOT to bear most of the cost of replacing the water main, as this goes against the policy that only unavoidable utility conflicts will be paid for as part of highway projects. Dianne should prioritize integrity and follow the established guidelines, even if it means potentially disappointing Warren or affecting her PE license recommendation.
