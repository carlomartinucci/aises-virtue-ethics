I would comply with the directive from my manager and issue the final report as revised by the Dewey legal firm. Despite the concerns raised by the older gentleman about potential contamination on the site, the client's attorney has deemed this information as hearsay and not reliable. Additionally, the client, Americorp, is aware of the alleged contamination and still owns the property. The refinancing is crucial for Americorp to proceed with their new project, and failure to close the financing would result in significant financial losses and potentially jeopardize the project's future.

Given that the client has all the information from the draft report and the final report's content does not impact the client's decision-making process, it is important to prioritize the client's needs and interests in this situation. By following the directive to issue the final report as revised, I am fulfilling my contractual obligation and helping Americorp secure the financing they need for their project to move forward. Additionally, considering the potential consequences outlined by the client's attorney, it is in the best interest of both the client and my firm to comply with the directive to avoid any legal repercussions and maintain a positive working relationship with Americorp.
