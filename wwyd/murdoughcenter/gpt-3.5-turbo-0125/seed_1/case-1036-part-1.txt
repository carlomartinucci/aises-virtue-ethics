Sam should immediately stop the transition plan proposed by Max, as it involves unethical and potentially illegal actions. He should schedule a meeting with Cal, Max, and Mrs. Sliderule to discuss the current situation at In-Line Engineering, including the competition from FBN Engineering Services and the decreased backlog. Sam should seek input and ideas from all team members for legitimate ways to improve the company's financial situation and competitiveness in the market. Sam should also consult with a financial advisor or business consultant to explore alternative strategies for addressing the challenges facing the company. Additionally, Sam should consider seeking a second medical opinion regarding his congestive heart failure diagnosis to ensure he is making decisions with his health in mind.
