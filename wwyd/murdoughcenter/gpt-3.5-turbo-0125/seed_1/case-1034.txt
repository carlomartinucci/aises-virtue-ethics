1. Hold a meeting with the leadership team of the Fairview CSC to discuss the concerns raised by Monroe and to address any potential conflicts of interest that may arise from their involvement in the courthouse/office building project.

2. Draft a formal statement to be released to the Fairview community addressing Monroe's allegations of conflict of interest and clarifying their commitment to ethical practices and transparency in their business dealings.

3. Seek guidance from legal counsel to ensure that they are in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations regarding conflicts of interest and ethical behavior in their industry.

4. Engage with the State professional engineering community to address any concerns raised by Monroe and to demonstrate their commitment to upholding the ethics of the engineering profession.

5. Consider recusing themselves from any involvement in the awarding of contracts for the courthouse/office building project to mitigate any perceived conflicts of interest and maintain the integrity of the project.
