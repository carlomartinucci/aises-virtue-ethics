I would firmly but respectfully communicate to the contractor that my professional recommendation is based on ensuring the long-term structural integrity of the buildings, rather than just meeting the minimum requirements of the local building code for the short-term warranty period. I would explain the potential risks and consequences of using shallow footings in compressible soils, emphasizing the likelihood of structural issues emerging in the future.

I would offer to provide a detailed explanation in writing, outlining the technical reasons behind my recommendation for pile foundations and the potential risks associated with using shallow footings. I would also highlight any relevant industry standards or best practices that support the use of pile foundations in similar soil conditions to strengthen the credibility of my recommendation.

If the contractor continues to insist on shallow footings despite my professional advice, I would document the situation thoroughly, including my recommendations, the contractor's decision, and any implications for the project's long-term stability. I would also consider consulting with a senior colleague or seeking guidance from a professional engineering association to ensure that I am handling the situation appropriately and ethically.
