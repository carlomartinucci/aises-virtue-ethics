I would inform Bill Broot in the morning that the cost estimate for the new project site adjacent to the Dawson Enterprises site would be $22,800. I would explain to him that since much of the information and analyses from the Dawson site can be leveraged for the new project, it allows for cost savings in the design work. I would emphasize the value proposition of reusing existing data and analyses to deliver quality work at a lower cost. This transparent communication would help manage expectations and demonstrate our commitment to efficiency and cost-effectiveness for the client.
