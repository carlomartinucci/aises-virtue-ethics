I would attend the mediation hearing as requested by Noall's attorney, as it is important to present the technical facts related to the claim settlement. However, I would maintain my position of not participating as a party to the settlement financially, as I believe my firm bears no financial obligation in this situation. I would calmly explain my stance during the mediation, emphasizing the evidence that supports the fact that the issues with the pile installations were not caused by my firm's design recommendations. If necessary, I would seek legal advice to protect my Professional Engineer's license and address any threats made by John Dour.
