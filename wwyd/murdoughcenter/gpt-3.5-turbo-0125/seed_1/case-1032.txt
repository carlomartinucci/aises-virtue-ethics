I would recommend that Topher schedule a meeting with the design engineers responsible for the Windsor Ridge development to discuss his concerns about the potential adverse impacts on the poorer families living south of the development. During this meeting, Topher should openly communicate his insights and observations regarding the secondary impacts that may affect these families, emphasizing the importance of considering the well-being of all community members in the development process.

Additionally, I would suggest that Topher work closely with the design engineers to explore potential modifications to the development plans that could mitigate or minimize the negative effects on the downstream community. This collaborative approach may involve adjusting drainage patterns, implementing traffic management solutions, or incorporating other design elements that address the concerns raised by Topher.

Furthermore, I would advise Topher to document his discussions and any proposed modifications to the development plans in writing, ensuring that there is a clear record of the considerations given to the impacts on the downstream community. By engaging in proactive communication and problem-solving with the design team, Topher can demonstrate his commitment to balancing economic progress with social responsibility and environmental stewardship in the best interests of the Plebian community as a whole.
