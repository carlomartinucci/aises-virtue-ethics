I would advise Julie to first carefully review the specific findings and evidence provided by Brock regarding the rusted clip angles in the exterior granite veneer of the Inverness Block. She should assess the potential risks associated with this structural issue, including the possibility of dislodged granite blocks causing damage or injury.

Next, I would recommend that Julie consult with a trusted structural engineer or building inspector to independently verify the extent of the problem with the clip angles and assess the overall structural integrity of the building. This expert opinion would help Julie make a more informed decision about the seriousness of the issue.

Based on the expert assessment, Julie should then consider her ethical obligations and legal responsibilities as a structural engineer. She should weigh the potential consequences of staying silent about the structural issues versus taking action to ensure the safety of the building and its occupants.

If the expert assessment confirms that the structural integrity of the building is compromised due to the rusted clip angles, I would advise Julie to inform Charles Smith and the potential buyers represented by Sam Goldworthy immediately. She should clearly communicate the risks associated with the building's condition and recommend necessary steps to address the safety concerns.

Julie should prioritize the safety of the public and the integrity of her profession over potential business relationships. By acting ethically and transparently in this situation, Julie can uphold her professional standards and protect the well-being of others.
