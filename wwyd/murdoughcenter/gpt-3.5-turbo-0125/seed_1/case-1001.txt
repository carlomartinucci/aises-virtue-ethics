I would advise Turnbuckle to gather all the documentation related to his work on the clock tower incident, including the correspondence with the state's Board of Registration for Engineers and Surveyors, his application for temporary licensure, and the notice of acceptance by the Board as a registered professional engineer by reciprocity. He should also collect any relevant information about his work history, qualifications, and the specific engineering services he provided during the project.

With this documentation in hand, Turnbuckle should seek legal counsel to review the complaint filed by I. B. Stout and assess the validity of the claims made against him. The legal counsel can provide guidance on how to respond to the complaint, including any necessary steps to defend himself against the allegations.

Additionally, Turnbuckle should be prepared to cooperate fully with the state Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors in their investigation of the matter. He should provide any requested information promptly and transparently to demonstrate his professionalism and commitment to upholding engineering standards.

In hindsight, Turnbuckle could have proactively sought clarification from the state's Board of Registration for Engineers and Surveyors regarding the need for a temporary engineering license before undertaking the design and implementation of the clock tower remediation. This step could have potentially prevented the complaint filed by I. B. Stout and the subsequent legal issues.
