Reilly should independently verify the information regarding the explosion-proof classification of the existing treatment room. He should consult with a qualified fire safety expert or inspector to conduct a thorough assessment of the room to determine if it meets the requirements of NFPA Code Section 820. If the room is not compliant, Reilly should bring this to the attention of Dante and the project manager, explaining the potential risks of non-compliance and the importance of ensuring the safety of the facility. Reilly should prioritize the safety and regulatory compliance of the wastewater treatment plant over concerns about project delays or upsetting stakeholders.
