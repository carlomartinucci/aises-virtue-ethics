I would have raised my concerns with Ralph and expressed my disappointment with his sudden departure, especially considering the impact it would have on the rest of the team and the office's operations. I would have also sought clarity on the future plans for the office and how the transition would be handled to ensure minimal disruption for the remaining staff. Additionally, I would have considered discussing the situation with the management in Boston to provide feedback and seek guidance on next steps for the office.
