I would advise Clayton to explore alternative options within the constraints of the civil service regulations. One possible course of action could be to work with the human resources department to see if there are any temporary accommodations or adjustments that can be made to Eleanor's role to better align with her current capabilities and circumstances. This could involve restructuring her responsibilities, providing additional support or training, or even temporarily reassigning her to a different role within the department that better suits her current situation. By finding a creative solution that supports Eleanor while also addressing the department's needs, Clayton may be able to navigate this challenging situation with compassion and integrity.
