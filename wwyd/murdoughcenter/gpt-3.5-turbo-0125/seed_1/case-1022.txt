Question 1:
If I accept the assignment from Zeller, I would decide my fee by considering the complexity of the project, the level of effort required, the potential value of the solution to Zeller Construction, and the market rates for similar consulting services in the area. I would also take into account the success of my previous solution for Hartwell Construction and the potential cost savings or profits that Zeller could achieve by implementing a similar solution.

Question 2:
If I am contacted by Hartwell to participate with them, I would decide the fee based on similar factors as for Zeller Construction. I would consider the value of my expertise to Hartwell, the potential impact of my solution on their project's success, and the competitive landscape in the industry. Given my previous successful collaboration with Hartwell, I may also take into account the long-term relationship and goodwill that could be fostered by working with them again.

Question 3:
If I find out that Hartwell has decided not to bid on the project, my decision on the fee would likely remain the same if I were to work with Zeller Construction. The fee would still be determined based on the value of my expertise to Zeller, the potential benefits of my solution to their project, and the market rates for consulting services. The absence of competition from Hartwell might influence the negotiation process, but the fundamental factors determining the fee would likely remain unchanged.
