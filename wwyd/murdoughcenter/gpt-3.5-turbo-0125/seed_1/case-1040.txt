Ethan should document his concerns about the field changes authorized by Marc and the potential degradation of the quality of materials and design resulting from the substitutions. He should then schedule a meeting with Marc to discuss these issues in a professional and constructive manner. During the meeting, Ethan should express his reservations about the changes and explain the importance of maintaining the agreed-upon standards for the project.

Ethan should work collaboratively with Marc to find a solution that aligns with the project requirements and ensures the quality of the final deliverables. If necessary, Ethan should involve other relevant stakeholders, such as representatives from EDOT, to address the concerns and make informed decisions about the field changes.

Throughout the process, Ethan should prioritize open communication, transparency, and a commitment to upholding professional standards and ethical responsibilities. By addressing the issue proactively and seeking to resolve it in a fair and transparent manner, Ethan can demonstrate his commitment to delivering a high-quality project while balancing the dynamics of the joint venture partnership.
