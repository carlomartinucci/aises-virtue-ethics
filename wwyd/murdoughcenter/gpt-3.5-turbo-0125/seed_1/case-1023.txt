I would first gather all the documentation related to the project, including any correspondence, contracts, and agreements with Moover Design Consultants. Then, I would carefully review the terms of the contract that was negotiated between my firm and Moover to understand the agreed-upon scope of work, deliverables, and payment terms.

Next, I would reach out to Moover Design Consultants in writing to express my concerns about the lack of communication and the discrepancy between the initial agreement and the current situation. I would request a meeting or a call with I. B. Shaker and Chuck Cleaver to discuss the status of the project, the role of my firm in the design process, and any issues that need to be resolved.

During the meeting or call, I would clearly communicate the importance of transparency, clear communication, and fair treatment in business relationships. I would seek clarification on the role of my firm in the project moving forward and ensure that the terms of our agreement are being upheld.

If after the meeting or call, I am not satisfied with the response or if I continue to experience unresponsiveness or lack of cooperation from Moover Design Consultants, I would consider seeking legal advice to explore my options for potential recourse, such as renegotiating the contract terms, escalating the issue to the funding agency, or taking legal action to protect my firm's interests.
