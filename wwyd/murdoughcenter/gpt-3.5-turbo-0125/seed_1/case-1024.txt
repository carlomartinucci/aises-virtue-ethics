I would advise Rod to document the instances of foremen putting boxes or articles in the resident engineer's pickup truck on Fridays. He should keep a detailed record of what he has observed, including the items being placed in the truck and the individuals involved. After documenting this information, Rod should schedule a meeting with his supervisor, Jim Upwright, to discuss what he has observed. During this meeting, Rod should present his documentation and express any concerns he may have regarding the potential ethical implications of these gifts. Additionally, Rod should inform Jim Upwright that he plans to report this information to Ethel Hicks, Upwright's supervisor at the DOT headquarters, to ensure transparency and accountability in the project.
