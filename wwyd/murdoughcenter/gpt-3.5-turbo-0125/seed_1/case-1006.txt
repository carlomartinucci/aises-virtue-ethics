I would first seek clarification from Charlie Oxx about the expectations regarding contributing to the council members' campaign funds. I would express my understanding of the situation and ask for guidance on how to proceed. I would also inquire about the potential impact on my career advancement within CWE if I choose not to contribute. This conversation would provide me with more insight into the situation and help me make an informed decision on how to handle the request.
