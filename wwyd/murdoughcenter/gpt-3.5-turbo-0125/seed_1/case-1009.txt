I would express my disappointment and concern to Mr. Young about the situation. I would remind him of the effort I put into preparing the detailed scope of work for the foundation investigation and the importance of following through with the agreed-upon proposal. I would also emphasize the potential risks and implications of changing the terms of the agreement, especially in terms of ensuring the structural integrity and safety of the proposed mid-rise condominium. Finally, I would request a meeting with Mr. Young to discuss the situation further and clarify any misunderstandings that may have led to this decision.
