Gwen should first carefully review the company's policies and guidelines regarding email and data privacy to ensure she has a clear understanding of the rules in place. She should then schedule a meeting with Lawrence to discuss her concerns about the potential breach of trust and invasion of privacy that accessing employees' email files without consent could cause. During this meeting, Gwen should propose alternative solutions to address the issue of employees misusing company email, such as implementing software to monitor email usage patterns or conducting training sessions on appropriate email etiquette. Gwen should emphasize the importance of maintaining a positive work environment based on trust and respect for employees' privacy while still upholding company policies.
