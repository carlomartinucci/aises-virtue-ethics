I would advise Carlos to prioritize the safety of the workers above all else. He should not compromise on safety measures just to meet the project deadline or secure a permanent contract with the firm. Carlos should push back against his boss's ultimatum and insist on hiring qualified workers and implementing additional safety measures to ensure the well-being of the Ecuadorian workers and the successful completion of the project. Carlos should also explore options for legalizing the workers to provide them with proper compensation and benefits. If his boss continues to resist these changes, Carlos may need to consider escalating the issue to higher management or relevant authorities to protect the workers and uphold ethical standards.
