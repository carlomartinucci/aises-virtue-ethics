I would express my concerns to the Vice President for Operations about the ethical implications of charging my time to the Excaliber project while actually working on the Wellfleet project. I would request a meeting with the Vice President to discuss the potential consequences of misallocating project funds and the impact it could have on the firm's reputation and relationships with clients. Additionally, I would propose alternative solutions, such as renegotiating the budget for the Wellfleet project or seeking additional resources to ensure the project is completed properly within the original contract terms.
