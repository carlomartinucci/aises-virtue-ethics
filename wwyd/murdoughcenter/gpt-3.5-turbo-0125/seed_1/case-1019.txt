I would schedule a meeting with the president of Global Engineering and Construction to discuss the situation regarding Roy and the potential conflict of interest with Hotspark Electrical Co. During the meeting, I would present my observations and concerns about the personal relationship between Roy and the daughter of Hotspark's owner, as well as the possible preferential treatment being given to the subcontractor. I would also express my worries about the potential compromises in the quality of work on ongoing projects.

I would request guidance from the president on how to address the situation effectively while upholding the company's values and ensuring that the firm's interests are protected. Additionally, I would seek advice on any specific actions that should be taken to investigate further and mitigate any risks associated with the conflict of interest.

By proactively seeking guidance from senior management and addressing the issue transparently, I aim to demonstrate my commitment to ethical conduct, protect the company's reputation, and ensure that project decisions are made impartially and in the best interest of the firm.
