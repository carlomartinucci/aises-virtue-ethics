Robert should schedule a meeting with his boss, James, to discuss his concerns about the over-design of the foundation and the potential liability issues. During the meeting, Robert should present his findings and explain how the project could have been more cost-effective and efficient if the geotechnical recommendations had been followed accurately. Robert should also express his worries about the lack of a qualified design team and construction oversight on the project. Additionally, Robert should suggest implementing quality control measures for the remaining construction phases to ensure the structural integrity of the buildings. James may then decide whether to take any further actions or steps to address these issues within the firm's capacity.
