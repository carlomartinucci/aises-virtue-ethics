I would immediately contact my supervisor or a senior executive within my firm to inform them of the situation. I would provide a detailed account of what I witnessed at the Industrial Solvents site, including Mr. Klene's actions of tampering with the monitoring wells to manipulate the groundwater data. I would explain the implications this has on the accuracy and reliability of our report, and emphasize the urgency of the situation given the upcoming presentation to the state regulatory agency. I would seek guidance on how to proceed ethically and professionally in light of this new information and the contractual obligations with Industrial Solvents Ltd.
