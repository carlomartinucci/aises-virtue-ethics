I would promptly return the call from the Elm Grove Gazette and schedule a meeting with the editorial team to discuss the situation. During the meeting, I would provide a detailed explanation of the pump selection process for the wastewater treatment plant project. I would clarify that the decision to specify the Pumpco equipment over the Excelsior pumps was made in consultation with the city's project manager, Dee Taylor, due to cost considerations and the city's budget constraints at that time. I would also emphasize that the long-term advantages and life-cycle savings of the Excelsior pumps were presented and documented to Ms. Taylor, but ultimately the decision was made to go with the lower-cost option.

Additionally, I would offer to provide any necessary documentation or evidence to support the decision-making process regarding the pump selection. I would express our willingness to work with the city to address the recurring pump failures and find a suitable solution to ensure the proper functioning of the treatment plant.

Lastly, I would assure the Elm Grove Gazette that our firm takes full responsibility for the equipment specified in the project and is committed to resolving the current issues in collaboration with the city.
