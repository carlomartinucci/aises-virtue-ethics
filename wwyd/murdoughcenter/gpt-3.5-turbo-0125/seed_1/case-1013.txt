I would decide to follow the directive given by my manager and issue the final report as revised by the Dewey legal firm. This decision is based on the following reasons:

1. The client, Americorp, is not selling the property and is aware of the alleged contamination. They have all the information from the draft report, so issuing the final report with the revisions requested by the client's law firm should not have a significant impact on the client's knowledge.

2. The refinancing for the property is crucial for Americorp's new project to proceed, and failure to close the financing could result in significant financial damages in the millions of dollars. As an engineer working for Enviro/Universal, my primary responsibility is to provide accurate and timely information to clients, and in this case, issuing the final report as requested is essential to prevent potential harm to the client.

3. My manager has emphasized that compliance with the directive will impact my future with the firm. As an employee, it is important to consider the consequences of my actions on my career and professional relationships. Following the directive from my manager demonstrates professionalism and a commitment to fulfilling my responsibilities within the organization.

Overall, issuing the final report as revised by the client's law firm aligns with the client's knowledge, prevents financial harm, and demonstrates professional integrity in following organizational directives.
