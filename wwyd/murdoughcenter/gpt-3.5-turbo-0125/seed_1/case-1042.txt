I would recommend that Rashid schedule a meeting with Janis, the building inspector, to discuss his concerns about the potential issue with the steel beam coating. During the meeting, Rashid should provide Janis with the specific details he observed regarding the inaccessible portions of the beams and express his concerns about the quality and safety implications.

Rashid should also document his observations and concerns in writing, including any relevant project specifications and photos if possible. This documentation can serve as evidence to support his claims and demonstrate his commitment to ensuring quality and safety on the project.

Additionally, Rashid should seek guidance from a more experienced colleague within the company, someone who may be able to provide advice on how to approach the situation effectively while navigating the hierarchy within the organization.

By taking these steps, Rashid can demonstrate his commitment to upholding standards of quality and safety on the project, while also seeking support and guidance from relevant stakeholders to address the issue in a responsible manner.
