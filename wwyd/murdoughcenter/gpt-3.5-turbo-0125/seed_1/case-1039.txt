I would immediately gather all the documentation related to the sampling and verbal report I made to Chuck regarding the drums at the client's property. I would then schedule a meeting with Chuck to discuss the situation and express my concerns about the potential misrepresentation of the sampling results. During the meeting, I would present the evidence I have, including the notes and samples, to support my claims. I would emphasize the importance of maintaining ethical standards and following legal procedures when dealing with hazardous materials. If necessary, I would escalate the issue to higher management within the company to ensure that the proper actions are taken to address the situation and uphold professional integrity.
