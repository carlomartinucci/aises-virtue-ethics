Daulton should immediately inform ClearWater's legal department about the conflict of interest involving Elias and Shellie. He should provide all relevant documentation, including the plat and field notes showing their ownership of the property affected by the new road. Daulton should work with the legal team to determine the best course of action to address the ethical issue, which may include disclosing the conflict to relevant parties, revising the plat to accurately reflect ownership, and taking steps to prevent similar situations in the future. Daulton should prioritize integrity and transparency in handling this situation to protect ClearWater's reputation and ensure ethical practices are maintained.
