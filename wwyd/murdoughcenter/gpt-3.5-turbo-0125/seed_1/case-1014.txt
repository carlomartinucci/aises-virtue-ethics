I would advise Roger to document his concerns and the sequence of events in writing, including his uneasiness about providing the draft report to Frank Bullock and the potential misuse of the information. He should keep a record of this documentation for his own protection in case any issues arise in the future. Additionally, Roger should consider discussing his concerns with a trusted colleague or mentor within the firm to seek advice on how to handle the situation professionally. Moving forward, Roger should exercise caution when sharing sensitive project information, especially with individuals who may have conflicting interests, and ensure that he follows the proper protocols for handling confidential client data to maintain trust and integrity within the firm.
