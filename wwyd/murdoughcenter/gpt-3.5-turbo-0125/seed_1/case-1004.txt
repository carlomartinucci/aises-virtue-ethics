I would inform Fulton Adams about the information I have gathered regarding Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert's personal relationship. I would emphasize the potential conflict of interest this situation may present, as they are now living together and working closely on the Kinkora case. I would recommend that this information be disclosed to the court to ensure transparency and the integrity of the legal proceedings.
