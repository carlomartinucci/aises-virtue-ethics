I would not agree to Owatadeel's proposal to pay him a retainer and additional fees for obtaining the design contract from Obigee. This arrangement seems unethical and could potentially violate anti-bribery laws. Instead, I would seek alternative ways to establish a local presence in Utopia and secure the project, such as exploring other local firms or legal avenues to comply with Utopian regulations. I would also discuss this situation with the leadership at Choice Engineering, Inc. to ensure that we pursue the project in a transparent and ethical manner.
