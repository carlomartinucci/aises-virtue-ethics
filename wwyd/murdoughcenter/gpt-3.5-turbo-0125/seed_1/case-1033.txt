Dianne should stick to the original design that avoids impacting the old water main in Shadyvale, as per State DOT policy. She should not change the design to intentionally impact the water main in order to shift the cost burden to the State DOT. Dianne should prioritize following the established policies and guidelines, ensuring the integrity of the project and her professional ethics. Additionally, she should address any concerns she has about Warren's request by discussing them with him directly and seeking clarification on his intentions.
