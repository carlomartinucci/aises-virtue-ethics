Jack should immediately contact the drilling crew and geologist who conducted the subsurface explorations for the office building complex project. He should request a meeting with them as soon as possible to discuss the missing borings and clarify the discrepancies in the information provided. Jack should also request any additional documentation or data that may help him verify the accuracy of the subsurface exploration logs.

In parallel, Jack should inform his client about the situation, explaining the potential issue with the missing borings and the steps he is taking to address it. He should request an extension on the deadline for the foundation design recommendation report to ensure that he has enough time to gather and verify the necessary information.

Furthermore, Jack should review the project timeline and resources to see if there are any alternative strategies or workarounds that could help him meet the deadline while ensuring the accuracy and reliability of his recommendations. He should prioritize resolving the issue with the missing borings to avoid any potential errors in the design process.
