Given the scenario, I would feel positive about the job interview process, as all four companies have indicated they are likely to make an offer for a good position at an excellent salary. At this point, I would send personalized thank you emails to each of the companies that interviewed me, expressing gratitude for the opportunity to meet with them and reiterating my interest in working for their organization. Additionally, I would follow up with each company individually to inquire about the timeline for final decisions and offer notifications, to ensure open communication and stay informed about the next steps in the hiring process.
