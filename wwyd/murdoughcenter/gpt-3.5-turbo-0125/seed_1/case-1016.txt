Question 1:
As the President of Nearby Engineers, I would feel conflicted about submitting an additional proposal when Trueheart Engineers have already been selected for the project by the Public Works staff. I would consider the ethical implications of potentially undermining the selection process and causing confusion and doubt about the integrity of the decision-making process.

Question 2:
As a professional engineer on the County Public Works Department staff and a member of the interview/selection team for the project, if the Director of Public Works has overturned the announced QBS selection process and my professional evaluation of the proposed consultants, I would consider raising my concerns with higher authorities within the department. I would aim to ensure transparency and fairness in the selection process and uphold the principles of ethical conduct in engineering practices.

Question 3:
As the Director of Public Works, if I have been instructed by a member of the Board of Supervisors to hire Nearby Engineers regardless of the announced QBS selection procedure, I would carefully assess the situation and consider the potential consequences of deviating from the established process. I would weigh the ethical considerations of following orders versus upholding the principles of fair and transparent selection procedures in engineering contracts. I would also explore avenues to address the issue with the Board of Supervisors and seek a resolution that aligns with ethical standards.

Question 4:
As the President of Trueheart Engineers, after spending considerable professional time refining the scope of work and contract for the project, I would first seek clarification from the County Public Works Department about the reasons for the delay and change in selection. I would aim to understand the rationale behind the decision to hire Nearby Engineers instead. Depending on the response and the circumstances, I would consider discussing the situation with legal counsel to explore potential recourse or remedies for the time and effort invested in the project that was ultimately not awarded to my firm.
