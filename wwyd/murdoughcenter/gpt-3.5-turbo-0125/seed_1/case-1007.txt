I would first gather all the information shared by Ted, Alice, and my wife during the weekend at the cottage. This includes details about the construction projects involving Shreud Contractors at the university, as well as the potential conflicts of interest and favoritism involving the University Architect and other individuals.

Next, I would verify the information provided by conducting some preliminary research. This could involve checking public records related to the construction projects, looking up any relevant news articles, and possibly reaching out to other contacts in the industry to gather more insights.

After confirming the details, I would schedule a meeting with the Vice President for Finance at the university, to whom the University Architect reports. In the meeting, I would present the information I have gathered and express my concerns about the potential conflicts of interest and favoritism in the construction projects.

During the meeting, I would emphasize the importance of transparency, fairness, and integrity in the university's construction projects. I would also offer any assistance or cooperation needed to further investigate the situation and ensure that the university's resources are being used appropriately.

Additionally, I would consider reaching out to relevant authorities or organizations, such as the local ethics commission or the university board of trustees, if further action is necessary to address the potential ethical issues raised during the weekend at the cottage.
