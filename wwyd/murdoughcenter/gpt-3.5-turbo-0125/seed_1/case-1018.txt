I would first gather all the identical project reports submitted by the students as evidence. Then, I would schedule individual meetings with each of the seven students who turned in identical reports. During these meetings, I would confront them with the evidence of the identical content in their reports and ask them to explain the situation.

Based on their responses, I would assess whether this was a case of intentional plagiarism or perhaps a misunderstanding or mistake. I would remind them of the university's academic integrity policies and the consequences of plagiarism.

Next, I would review the university's policies on academic dishonesty and plagiarism to determine the appropriate course of action. I would consider assigning alternative projects or penalties based on the severity of the plagiarism and the students' explanations.

Finally, I would grade the projects fairly based on the revised assessments and ensure that the integrity of the course and the academic standards of the university are upheld. If necessary, I would report the incident to the department chair upon their return for further guidance on how to proceed.
