I would not sign up for the plan offered by Creative Communications Corporation (CCC) that allows for internal markup on long distance telephone charges passed on to clients. Instead, I would continue billing clients for these expenses at actual cost without any additional markup. This is in line with the clients' preferences for expenses to be passed on at actual cost without overhead included. Additionally, maintaining transparency in billing practices by passing on actual costs fosters trust and good relationships with clients.
