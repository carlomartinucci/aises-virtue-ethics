I would decline the settlement offer from the adjacent property owner and continue to defend my firm in court. I would rely on the evidence and documentation we have that clearly shows we advised the bank and its project manager about obtaining permission for installing the tiebacks on the adjacent property. I would work closely with our lawyer to present our case effectively in court and demonstrate that our firm acted ethically and responsibly by providing the necessary warnings and guidance to the bank. Additionally, I would ensure that all relevant documentation and communication with the bank regarding the permission for tieback installation are presented as evidence to support our defense.
