I would document the observations I made at the engineering society conference, including the presence of Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert together, and the information I gathered about their living situation from a reliable source in Clyde's office.

It's important to ensure that all parties involved in the legal proceedings are aware of any potential biases or conflicts that could impact the fairness of the trial.
