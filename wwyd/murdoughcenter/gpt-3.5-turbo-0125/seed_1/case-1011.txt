I would thank John Bigge for considering me for the final engineering design of the project and express my appreciation for the opportunity. I would then ask for more details about the specific concerns he has with the preliminary recommendations made by Weeks and Weeks. I would inquire about any particular aspects of the project that he believes need to be addressed differently or improved upon. I would also request to review the preliminary report and any feedback from the planning commission to better understand the project requirements and expectations.

Based on this information, I would offer to conduct a thorough review of the preliminary report and provide my professional assessment on how I can add value to the final engineering design process. I would assure John Bigge that I am committed to delivering high-quality work that aligns with the project goals and meets the necessary standards. If there are any specific modifications or adjustments needed, I would discuss how I can address those effectively in the final design phase.

Ultimately, I would convey my interest in collaborating with Ramrod Enterprises on this project and emphasize my dedication to delivering a successful outcome that meets their needs and expectations.
