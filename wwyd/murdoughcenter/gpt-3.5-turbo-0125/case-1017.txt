Bert should gather all the relevant evidence, such as the original drawings from his previous job at County Line Design and any communication or contracts related to the subcontracting work between County Line Design and Far Horizons Engineering. He should then schedule a meeting with his supervisor or a higher-up at Far Horizons to discuss his concerns and present the evidence he has collected. During the meeting, Bert should clearly and calmly explain the situation, emphasizing the potential ethical and legal implications of using the drawings without proper authorization. He should express his commitment to upholding professional standards and protecting intellectual property rights. Bert should also suggest conducting an internal investigation to determine the origin of the drawings and rectify any unauthorized use.
