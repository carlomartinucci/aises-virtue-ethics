I would firmly explain to the contractor the potential risks and consequences of using shallow footing foundations instead of piles based on my professional analysis. I would provide clear and detailed explanations of how the moderate compressibility of the subsoils could lead to long-term settlements that may cause structural issues in the future, even if not immediately apparent during the warranty period.

I would emphasize the importance of prioritizing the long-term structural integrity and stability of the buildings to ensure the safety and durability of the structures for the eventual buyers. I would offer to provide additional documentation and evidence to support my recommendations, such as case studies or geotechnical reports from similar projects.

If the contractor continues to insist on using shallow footings against my professional recommendation, I would escalate the issue to the project manager or other relevant stakeholders within the design-build team. I would make it clear that compromising on the foundation design could lead to potential legal and financial liabilities in the future, and that my priority is to uphold the highest standards of engineering ethics and professional integrity in my work.
