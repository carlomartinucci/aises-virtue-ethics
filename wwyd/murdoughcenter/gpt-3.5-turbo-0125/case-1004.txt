I would inform Fulton Adams about the observed relationship between Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert. I would explain that based on my discreet inquiries and confirmation from another engineer, it appears that Cleghorn and Cuthbert are in a romantic relationship and living together. I would emphasize the potential conflict of interest this poses, especially considering Cleghorn's role as an engineering consultant and expert witness for Kinkora Developments in the ongoing case against Wastewater Treatment Systems. I would recommend that Adams consider raising this issue with the court to ensure transparency and fairness in the legal proceedings.
