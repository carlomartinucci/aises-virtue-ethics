I would advise Rashid to document his concerns about the potential oversight regarding the steel beams that are inaccessible for the coating procedure. He should gather evidence such as photographs or written observations to support his claim. Rashid should then schedule a meeting with Riley to present his findings and express his concerns about the quality of work being compromised. During the meeting, Rashid should remain calm and professional, emphasizing the importance of ensuring that the construction meets safety standards and specifications. Rashid should also propose potential solutions to address the issue, such as bringing in additional resources to rectify the problem without causing significant delays to the project. By taking a proactive approach and providing concrete evidence, Rashid can demonstrate his commitment to upholding quality standards while also respecting the project timeline.
