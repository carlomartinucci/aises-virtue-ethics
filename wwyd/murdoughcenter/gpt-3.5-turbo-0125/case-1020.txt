I would attend the mediation hearing as requested by Noall's attorney to present the technical facts related to the pile design recommendations made by my firm. During the mediation, I would firmly assert that my firm's recommendations were correct and that we are not financially obligated to contribute to the settlement of the claim. I would provide all the evidence and documentation supporting our position to demonstrate that the issues with the pile driving were not due to any fault on our part. If pressured to contribute financially, I would stand my ground and emphasize the technical evidence uncovered during the investigation.
