I would feel excited about the job interview process, knowing that I have made a positive impression on four different engineering firms in the new location. I would also feel confident about the potential job offers, considering the positive feedback I received during the interviews.

At this point, I would follow up with each of the firms to express my continued interest in working for them. I would also send personalized thank-you notes to each interviewer, highlighting specific aspects of the discussions that resonated with me. Additionally, I would proactively inquire about the timeline for decision-making and ask if there were any additional materials or information they needed from me to expedite the process. Finally, I would ensure that I am easily reachable and responsive in case any of the firms need to contact me for further discussions or clarifications.
