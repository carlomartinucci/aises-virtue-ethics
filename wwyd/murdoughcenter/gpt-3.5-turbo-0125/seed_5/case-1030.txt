Reilly should conduct a thorough inspection of the existing treatment room to verify if it meets the requirements for being explosion proof as outlined in the NFPA 820 code. This inspection should involve checking all electrical sockets, light switches, lighting fixtures, and junction boxes to ensure they are explosion proof. If after the inspection Reilly still has doubts about the room's compliance with the code, he should raise his concerns to Dante and suggest bringing in a qualified expert to assess the situation and provide a definitive answer. It is important to prioritize safety and regulatory compliance in this situation, even if it may lead to additional project delays or costs.
