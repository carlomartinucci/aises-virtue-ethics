Robert should schedule a meeting with his boss, James, to discuss his concerns about the project. He should provide a detailed account of the situation, emphasizing the discrepancies between his geotechnical recommendations and the actual foundation construction. Robert should express his worries about potential liability for his firm due to the suboptimal construction methods being used on the project. Additionally, he should propose a plan of action to mitigate the risks and address the inefficiencies in the construction process, such as providing further quality control monitoring and testing for the remaining buildings. Robert should seek James' guidance on how to proceed and ensure that the firm's reputation and integrity are protected.
