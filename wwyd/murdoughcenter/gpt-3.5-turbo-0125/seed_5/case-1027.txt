In the morning, when I call Bill Broot back to discuss the new project adjacent to the Dawson Enterprises site, I will inform him that the estimated cost for the design work on the new project site would be $22,800. I will explain to him that this reduced cost takes into account the reuse of information and analyses gathered for the Dawson site, which will save time and resources on the new project. I will be transparent about the cost breakdown and the reasons behind the adjusted estimate to ensure clear communication and mutual understanding between Multiplex Design Ltd and Universal International Unlimited Developers.
