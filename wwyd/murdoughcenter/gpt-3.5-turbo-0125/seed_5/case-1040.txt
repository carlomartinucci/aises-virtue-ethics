Ethan should immediately schedule a meeting with Marc to discuss the concerns he has regarding the unauthorized field changes that have been made. During the meeting, Ethan should clearly and calmly communicate his reservations about the quality of the electronics hardware that has been substituted, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the agreed-upon specifications to ensure the overall integrity and functionality of the intelligent transportation system being developed for the City of Franklin. Ethan should also express his commitment to upholding professional standards and delivering a high-quality project that meets the expectations of EDOT.

Ethan should propose a thorough review of the subcontractor submittals and field changes together with Marc to identify any discrepancies and address them appropriately. It is crucial for Ethan to assert his expertise as the design lead and advocate for the best interests of the project, even if it means pushing back against decisions made by the construction partner.

Furthermore, Ethan should suggest establishing a formal process for addressing design conflicts and deviations from the project specifications moving forward to prevent similar issues from arising in the future. This could involve setting up a change management protocol that requires mutual agreement on any modifications to the original design, ensuring that both parties are aligned on the changes being made.

By taking proactive steps to address the concerns regarding the field changes and reinforcing the importance of maintaining design integrity, Ethan can demonstrate his commitment to delivering a successful project while upholding professional standards and fulfilling his responsibilities as a partner in the joint venture with Specialty Transit, Inc.
