Dianne should proceed by upholding the State DOT policy and designing the project layout to avoid impacting the existing water main in Shadyvale, as she had initially planned. She should not change the design to intentionally impact the water main just to shift the cost burden to the State DOT. Dianne should prioritize following the established guidelines and regulations, ensuring that the project is carried out in accordance with the policies in place. If Warren pushes for the design change during the review process, Dianne should respectfully discuss her concerns with him and explain the implications of deviating from the policy. It is important for Dianne to maintain her integrity and adhere to ethical standards in her professional conduct, even in the face of potential pressure or conflicting interests.
