I would advise Turnbuckle to review the specific regulations and laws regarding engineering practice in the state where the clock tower incident occurred. He should gather all relevant information and documentation related to his work on the clock tower remediation project to support his case. Turnbuckle should also seek legal counsel to understand his rights and options in responding to the complaint filed by Stout. It may be necessary for Turnbuckle to provide evidence of his experience and qualifications as a professional engineer in other states to demonstrate his competence in handling the clock tower issue. If required by the state board, Turnbuckle should cooperate fully with any investigations or proceedings related to the complaint.
