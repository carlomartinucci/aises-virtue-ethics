I would advise Clayton to explore alternative options within the constraints of the civil service regulations to support Eleanor during her difficult times. He could consider reassigning her to a role that aligns better with her current capabilities and health status, ensuring she can continue to contribute meaningfully to the department while receiving the support she needs. Additionally, Clayton could look into the possibility of providing Eleanor with flexible working hours or job-sharing arrangements to accommodate her caregiving responsibilities for her husband. It is crucial to communicate openly and compassionately with Eleanor about these potential changes to ensure her well-being is prioritized while maintaining the efficiency of the Public Works department.
