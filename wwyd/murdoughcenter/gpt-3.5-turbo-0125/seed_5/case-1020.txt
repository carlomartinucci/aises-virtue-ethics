I would review and gather all the technical evidence and documentation related to the geotechnical study, pile design recommendations, and the subsequent issues with the pile installations. I would prepare a comprehensive report outlining the correct design recommendations provided by our firm, the problems encountered during construction, the inferior quality of the pipe used, and the lack of action taken by Noall's field inspector despite clear evidence of faulty materials and construction practices.

I would attend the mediation hearing as requested and present the technical facts and evidence to support our position that our firm bears no financial responsibility for the claim. I would firmly assert that our firm acted in accordance with professional standards, provided accurate design recommendations, and was not allowed to address or rectify issues during the construction phase.

If pressured by Noall or threatened with professional consequences, I would seek legal counsel to understand my rights and options in this situation. I would prioritize upholding the integrity and reputation of our firm while also ensuring that the facts are accurately presented during the mediation process.
