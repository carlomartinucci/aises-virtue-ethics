I would suggest that Rashid document all his observations regarding the beam coating issue, including the fact that the beam is partially covered by a wall and may not have been properly coated according to specifications. He should also make a note of Gibb's lack of presence on the site and his focus on unrelated activities like skeet shooting.

Next, Rashid should schedule a meeting with Riley to discuss his concerns in a clear and concise manner. During the meeting, he should present his documented findings and emphasize the potential safety implications of the incomplete coating on the steel beams. Rashid should express his desire to ensure the project's quality and compliance with specifications.

If Riley continues to dismiss the issue and insists on prioritizing progress over quality, Rashid should consider escalating the matter to the appropriate authorities within the company or even to external regulatory bodies if necessary. It is essential for Rashid to prioritize public safety and not compromise on quality standards, even if it means challenging his superiors and risking potential backlash as a new employee.
