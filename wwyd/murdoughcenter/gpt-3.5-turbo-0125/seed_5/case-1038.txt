Daulton should immediately confront Elias and Shellie about their undeclared ownership of the property affected by the construction of the new road. He should insist that they disclose this information to all relevant parties, including Walbert Township, and rectify the situation transparently. Daulton should also inform ClearWater's leadership about the conflict of interest and work with them to address the issue ethically and responsibly. Additionally, Daulton should ensure that all future dealings with Elias and Shellie's joint venture are conducted with full transparency and integrity to uphold the company's reputation and avoid any potential legal or ethical repercussions.
