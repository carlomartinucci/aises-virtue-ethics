I would first gather all relevant documentation and communication related to the project to ensure I have a clear record of the agreement and expectations set by Moover Design Consultants. Then, I would schedule a meeting with my firm's legal team to discuss the situation and explore potential options for addressing the issue. This may involve reviewing the contract terms, assessing any breach of agreement by Moover, and determining the best course of action to protect our firm's interests and reputation. Additionally, I would consider reaching out to other subcontractors who have worked with Moover in the past to gather more information and insights that could inform our decision-making process.
