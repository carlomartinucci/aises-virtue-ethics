I would advise Rod to document the observations of the foremen placing items in the resident engineer's pickup truck on Fridays. He should keep a detailed record of the dates, items, and individuals involved. Rod should then bring this information to his direct supervisor, Jim Upwright, as soon as possible. If Upwright does not take appropriate action, Rod should report the situation to Ethel Hicks, Upwright's supervisor at the DOT headquarters, during her next visit to the site. It is important for Rod to report this information promptly to ensure transparency and integrity in the project's operations.
