I would consult with my lawyer and review all the evidence and documentation related to the situation, including the design report that clearly stated the need for the bank to obtain permission for installing the tiebacks on the adjacent property. I would also discuss the specific legal implications of the case with my lawyer.

Based on the evidence and legal advice, I would reject the settlement offer from the adjacent property owner. I would continue to assert that my firm had fulfilled its ethical and professional responsibility by advising the bank about the need to obtain permission for the tiebacks, as documented in the design report. I would stand by the fact that the responsibility for obtaining permission rested with the bank and not my firm.

Furthermore, I would make sure to present all the evidence and documentation in court to defend my firm's position and establish that we acted ethically and in accordance with professional standards. I would work closely with my lawyer to effectively communicate and support our defense during the trial.

In summary, I would reject the settlement offer, continue to assert my firm's position based on the evidence and legal advice, and prepare to defend our actions in court to prove our ethical conduct in the situation.
