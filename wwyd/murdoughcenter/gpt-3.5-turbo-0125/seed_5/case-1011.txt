I would thank John Bigge for considering me for the final engineering design for the project. I would express my appreciation for his confidence in my expertise and reputation in the community. I would then ask for more details about the specific concerns regarding the preliminary recommendations made by Weeks and Weeks, in order to understand the project requirements better. I would also inquire about the timeline and project scope to ensure that I can deliver the desired results effectively. Finally, I would confirm my interest in taking on the project and discuss next steps for moving forward with the final engineering design work.
