Question 1:
As the President of Nearby Engineers, I would feel conflicted about submitting an additional proposal knowing that Trueheart Engineers have already been selected for the project by the Public Works staff. I would consider the potential ethical implications of participating in a process that deviates from the original QBS selection procedure and could undermine the integrity of the selection process. I would also evaluate the impact of my decision on the reputation of my firm and its relationship with the County Public Works Department.

Question 2:
As a professional engineer on the County Public Works Department staff and a member of the interview/selection team for this project, I would raise my concerns about the Director of Public Works overturning the announced QBS selection process and professional evaluation of the proposed consultants. I would document my objections and present them to the appropriate authorities within the department or escalate the issue to higher management or external oversight bodies if necessary to ensure transparency and adherence to established procedures.

Question 3:
As the Director of Public Works, upon being instructed by a member of the Board of Supervisors to hire Nearby Engineers regardless of the announced QBS selection procedure, I would uphold the principles of fairness, transparency, and professional ethics by refusing to comply with the directive. I would communicate my concerns to the Board of Supervisors, emphasizing the importance of following established selection procedures to ensure the best outcomes for the project and maintain public trust in the decision-making process.

Question 4:
As the President of Trueheart Engineers, I would address the situation by seeking clarification from the County Public Works Department on the reasons for the delay and the deviation from the QBS selection process. I would express my concerns about the impact of the decision on our firm's resources and professional commitment to the project. If necessary, I would consider negotiating for compensation for the time and effort spent on refining the scope of work and contract, or seeking alternative avenues to mitigate the potential losses incurred by the delay in project commencement.
