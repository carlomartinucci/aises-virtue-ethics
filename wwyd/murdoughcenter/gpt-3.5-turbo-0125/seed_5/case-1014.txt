Roger should document his concerns about the situation, including his uneasiness about providing the draft report to Frank Bullock, the lack of clarity on how the information will be used, and the potential implications of this action. He should keep a record of his communication with his boss, Bill Mason, expressing his concerns and seeking clarification on the firm's policies regarding sharing draft reports with private sector clients.

In the future, Roger should ensure that he clearly understands the firm's policies and procedures regarding the handling of sensitive project information, especially when it involves potential conflicts of interest with private sector clients. He should consider discussing his concerns with a trusted colleague or seeking guidance from a professional engineering organization on ethical practices in consulting engineering firms.
