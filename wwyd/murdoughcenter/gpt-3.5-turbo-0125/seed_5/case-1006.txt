I would first carefully review the firm's code of conduct and any relevant policies regarding ethical behavior and conflicts of interest. I would then schedule a meeting with a trusted senior colleague or mentor within the company to seek advice on how to handle the situation. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about the expectations outlined by Charlie Oxx and seek guidance on how to navigate the situation while upholding my personal values and professional integrity. I would also inquire about any potential repercussions for not complying with the implied request for contributions. Based on the advice received and my own assessment of the situation, I would decide on an appropriate course of action that aligns with ethical standards and my own principles.
