I would advise Carlos to prioritize the safety and well-being of the workers above all else. Even though completing the project on time and securing a permanent contract with the firm are important goals, the potential risks to the workers' health and safety must be addressed first and foremost.

Specifically, I would recommend that Carlos firmly express his concerns to his boss about the lack of experience of the workers in working with concrete and the need for additional safety measures on the construction site. He should emphasize the importance of ensuring that the workers are protected from any potential harm and that the project is completed in a safe and responsible manner.

If his boss insists on proceeding with the current workers and without additional safety measures, I would suggest that Carlos consider escalating the issue to higher management within the company or seeking advice from relevant authorities to ensure that the workers' rights and safety are protected.

Ultimately, Carlos should not compromise on the safety of the workers for the sake of completing the project on time or securing a permanent contract. It is crucial to prioritize ethics and integrity in his decision-making process.
