I would promptly return the call from the Elm Grove Gazette to provide a statement. I would take responsibility for the decision to specify the Pumpco equipment in the bid documents, explaining that it was ultimately my call as the firm's representative. I would acknowledge the current issues with the pumps and express regret for any inconvenience or costs incurred by the city due to the failures. Additionally, I would offer to work with the city to find a solution to the ongoing pump problems and to address any concerns they may have moving forward.
