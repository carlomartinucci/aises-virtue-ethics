Question 1:
If I accept the assignment from Zeller, I would first review the scope and complexity of the project to understand the level of effort required. I would then consider the value of the solution I am providing based on the potential cost savings and benefits to Zeller Construction. Taking into account my experience, expertise, and the market rates for similar services in the area, I would determine a fair and competitive fee for my services. I would also factor in the potential impact on my reputation and future business opportunities when deciding on the fee.

Question 2:
If contacted by Hartwell to participate with them, I would consider the value of the solution I provided to them in the past project and the potential benefits they gained from it. I would also take into account the current market conditions and the level of competition for the project. Based on these factors, I would negotiate a fee that reflects the value of my services to Hartwell while also being fair and competitive in the market.

Question 3:
If I find out that Hartwell has decided not to bid on the project, my decision on the fee would remain largely the same as in Question 2. I would still consider the value of my services to Hartwell in the past project, the potential benefits they gained, and the current market conditions when negotiating the fee. However, I may also take into account the fact that Hartwell is not bidding on the project and adjust the fee accordingly if I believe it could impact the overall value of my services to them in this specific context.
