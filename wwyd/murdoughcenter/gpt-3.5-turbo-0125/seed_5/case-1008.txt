I would immediately contact my supervisor and the legal department within my firm to inform them of what I witnessed at the Industrial Solvents site. I would provide a detailed account of the actions I observed Ira Klene taking with the monitoring wells and explain the implications of his actions on the integrity of our report and the potential misrepresentation of data.

I would recommend that the legal department review the confidentiality clause in our contract with Industrial Solvents Ltd. to determine the best course of action regarding our obligations to discuss the findings with them before releasing the information to the state agency. Additionally, I would suggest that we consider postponing the presentation to the state regulatory agency until we have resolved this issue and can ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data presented.

I would also advise my supervisor and the legal department on the steps we should take to address the situation with Mr. Klene and Industrial Solvents Ltd. in a professional and ethical manner, including the possibility of terminating our contract with them if necessary to maintain the integrity of our work and reputation.
