I would first gather all relevant information about the situation, including the costs involved, the potential benefits of working with International Affiliates, and the ethical implications of the proposed arrangement. 

Next, I would carefully review the company's code of conduct and any relevant laws and regulations regarding business practices in Utopia. 

I would then schedule a meeting with the company's senior management to present all the information I have gathered and discuss the potential risks and benefits of engaging with International Affiliates. 

During the meeting, I would recommend conducting a thorough due diligence process on International Affiliates to ensure they have the necessary qualifications and expertise to represent Choice Engineering in Utopia. 

I would also explore alternative options for establishing a local presence in Utopia, such as working with a different firm or setting up a subsidiary in the country. 

Ultimately, I would advise against rushing into a decision and instead recommend taking the time to carefully evaluate all options and make an informed choice that aligns with the company's values and ethical standards.
