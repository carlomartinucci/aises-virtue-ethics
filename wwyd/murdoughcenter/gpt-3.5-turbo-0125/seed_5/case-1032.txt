I would advise Topher to schedule a meeting with the design engineers responsible for the Windsor Ridge development. During this meeting, he should express his concerns about the potential adverse impacts on the downstream community, specifically regarding increased vehicle traffic and modified drainage patterns. Topher should request that the engineers explore alternative design options that could mitigate or minimize these impacts on the poorer families living south of the development. Additionally, he should inquire about the feasibility of incorporating additional measures to address these concerns while still meeting all necessary codes and regulations. By proactively engaging with the design team and advocating for the well-being of the impacted community, Topher can ensure that the development proceeds in a more socially responsible and sustainable manner.
