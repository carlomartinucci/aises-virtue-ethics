I would not sign up for the plan offered by Creative Communications Corporation (CCC) that allows for an internal markup on long distance telephone charges. Instead, I would continue billing my clients for these expenses at actual cost without any added markup. This approach aligns with the clients' preference for passing on expenses without additional overhead costs and maintains transparency in billing practices. Additionally, by adhering to the clients' requests, I can uphold trust and integrity in my client relationships.
