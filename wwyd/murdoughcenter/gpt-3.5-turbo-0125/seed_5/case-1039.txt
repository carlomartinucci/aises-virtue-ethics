I would first document all the details of the situation, including the instructions given by Chuck, the sampling process I followed, the verbal report I made to Chuck, and the conversation with my former co-workers at the remediation contractor. I would ensure that all this information is accurately recorded and stored for reference.

Next, I would reach out to Chuck to express my concerns about the discrepancy in the information provided to the client regarding the testing of the drum contents. I would explain that based on my knowledge and observations, the drums were most likely to contain hazardous waste, and it is important to ensure proper handling and disposal procedures are followed.

If Chuck does not address the issue satisfactorily or if there are indications of unethical behavior on his part, I would consider escalating the matter to higher management within Everclere Consultants, Inc. or to relevant regulatory authorities to ensure that proper protocols are followed and potential environmental risks are mitigated.

Additionally, I would refrain from discussing this matter with anyone outside the company or sharing any sensitive information that could compromise the integrity of the situation. It is essential to handle this matter with discretion and professionalism to uphold ethical standards and protect the interests of the client and the environment.
