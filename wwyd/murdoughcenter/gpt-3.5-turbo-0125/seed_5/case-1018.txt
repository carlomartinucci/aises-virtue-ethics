I would first schedule individual meetings with each of the students who submitted the identical project reports. During these meetings, I would confront them about the similarities in their reports and ask them to explain why their reports are so similar. I would listen to their responses and assess whether there are any valid reasons for the similarities.

Based on the students' explanations and any evidence they provide, I would then determine if there was any collaboration or plagiarism involved. If it is clear that plagiarism has occurred, I would follow the university's academic integrity policies and procedures for reporting and addressing such incidents.

In the event that the students claim there was no collaboration or plagiarism, I would carefully review the situation and consult with other faculty members or academic advisors for guidance on how to proceed. It is crucial to uphold academic integrity while also considering the potential consequences for the students involved, as well as the reputation of the university and the department.

Ultimately, I would make a fair and informed decision on how to address the situation, ensuring that academic integrity is upheld and that appropriate actions are taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.
