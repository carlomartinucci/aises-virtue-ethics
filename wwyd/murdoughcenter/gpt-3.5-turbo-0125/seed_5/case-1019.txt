I would schedule a meeting with the president of Global Engineering and Construction to discuss the situation regarding Roy and the potential conflict of interest with Hotspark Electrical. During the meeting, I would present the observations I have made about Roy's interactions with the young woman who is associated with Hotspark and express my concerns about the possibility of preferential treatment and compromised quality of work. I would also inquire about the company's stance on such situations and seek guidance on how to proceed in the best interest of the firm. Additionally, I would ask for advice on how to handle the situation given Roy's seniority and the impact it could have on the ongoing projects.
