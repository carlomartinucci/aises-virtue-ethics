Given the situation, I would document the observed interactions between Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert at the engineering society conference, noting that they attended the event together and were seen entering a room together. I would then inform Fulton Adams, the legal counsel for the insurance company, about this observation, emphasizing the potential conflict of interest that could arise from their personal relationship. It is important to ensure that all parties involved in the case are acting ethically and that any potential biases are brought to light. This information can be valuable in the legal proceedings and may impact the credibility of Cleghorn as an expert witness.
