Gwen should express her concerns to Lawrence about the potential breach of trust and invasion of privacy that accessing employees' email files without their knowledge or consent would entail. She should explain the importance of maintaining employees' trust and respecting their privacy rights. Gwen should propose alternative solutions to address the issue of excessive personal use of email, such as implementing a monitoring system that flags unusually high amounts of personal email usage or conducting training sessions to remind employees of the company's email policy. If Lawrence insists on accessing the email files, Gwen should consider escalating the matter to HR or legal authorities to ensure that the appropriate steps are taken in a lawful and ethical manner.
