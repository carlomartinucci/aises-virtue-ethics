I would document the observations and information I have gathered regarding Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert's relationship, and then discreetly bring this to the attention of Fulton Adams, the attorney for Wastewater Treatment Systems. I would explain the potential conflict of interest that could arise from Cleghorn and Cuthbert's personal relationship, especially in the context of their roles as an engineering consultant and legal representative for Kinkora Developments, respectively. I would suggest discussing this information with the legal team to determine the best course of action to address the situation before the trial begins to ensure transparency and integrity in the legal proceedings.
