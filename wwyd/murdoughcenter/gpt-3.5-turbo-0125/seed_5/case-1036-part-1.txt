I would advise Sam to take a step back and carefully reconsider the proposed transition plan with a more cautious and ethical approach. He should seek alternative solutions that do not involve deceiving employees, clients, or stakeholders. Sam should prioritize maintaining the integrity and reputation of In-Line Engineering, even if it means facing financial challenges in the short term. It is important to uphold ethical business practices and ensure the well-being of all individuals involved. Sam should also consider seeking advice from a trusted advisor or consulting with legal professionals to explore other options for the future of the company.
