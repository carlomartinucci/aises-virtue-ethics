I would first gather all the information I have heard from Alice, Ted, and my wife during the weekend at the lake cottage. I would then verify the accuracy of the information by conducting some discreet research, such as checking public records on recent contracts awarded to Shreud Contractors by the university and any ongoing construction projects at the university.

Next, I would schedule a meeting with the Vice President for Finance, to whom the University Architect reports, to discuss the information I have gathered. During the meeting, I would present the details of the situation involving Shreud Contractors, the University Architect, and potentially unethical practices in the construction projects. I would emphasize the importance of maintaining integrity and transparency in all university construction projects.

Additionally, I would express my concerns about potential conflicts of interest and suggest conducting a thorough review of the contracts awarded to Shreud Contractors and any other contractors involved in university projects. I would offer my assistance in ensuring that future construction projects at the university adhere to ethical standards and best practices in the industry.

Finally, I would follow up with the University President to brief them on the situation and the actions taken to address the potential ethical issues. I would stress the importance of upholding the university's reputation and ensuring that all construction projects are conducted with integrity and fairness.
