I would express my disappointment to Mr. Young about the situation and clarify the terms of our initial agreement. I would emphasize that our proposal included a detailed scope of work and a budget estimate for the entire foundation investigation, not just a portion of it. I would also remind him that we had agreed on the full scope of work and pricing before preparing the proposal.

I would then request a meeting with Mr. Young to discuss the matter further and try to negotiate a resolution. During the meeting, I would reiterate the importance of completing the entire foundation investigation for the project's success and the risks involved in splitting the work between different firms. I would aim to reach a mutually beneficial agreement that upholds the integrity of our initial proposal and ensures the project's structural integrity and success.
