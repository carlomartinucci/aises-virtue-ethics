I would advise Julie to prioritize the safety of the public and the integrity of her work. Given the potential danger posed by the rusted clip angles and the risk of injury or damage if the granite veneer blocks were to fall, Julie should take immediate action to ensure the safety of the building.

Specifically, Julie should contact the local building authorities or relevant regulatory body to report the structural integrity issue with the Inverness Block. She should provide them with all the information and evidence gathered by Brock during the structural survey, including the details about the rusted clip angles and the precarious condition of the exterior cladding. It is important to involve the appropriate authorities to address the safety concerns and prevent any potential accidents or hazards.

Additionally, Julie should communicate with her client, Charles Smith, about the critical findings and emphasize the importance of addressing the structural issues before finalizing the sale of the building. It is essential to prioritize safety over financial considerations and ensure that necessary measures are taken to rectify the structural deficiencies.

By taking proactive steps to address the safety concerns and uphold professional integrity, Julie can demonstrate a commitment to ethical behavior and safeguard the well-being of the community.
