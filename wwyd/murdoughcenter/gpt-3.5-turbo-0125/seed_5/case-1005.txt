I would express my concerns to the Vice President for Operations about the ethical implications of charging my time to the Excaliber project while actually working on the Wellfleet project. I would request a meeting to discuss the situation further and propose alternative solutions, such as renegotiating the contracts to ensure proper funding for the Wellfleet project or reallocating resources within the firm to address the budget shortfall. If necessary, I would escalate the issue to higher management or seek guidance from the firm's legal department to ensure compliance with ethical standards and contractual obligations.
