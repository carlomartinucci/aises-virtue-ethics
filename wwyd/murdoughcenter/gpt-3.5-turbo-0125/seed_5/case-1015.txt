I would firmly reiterate to the contractor the potential long-term consequences of using shallow spread footings instead of piles to support the office structures. I would explain in detail the risks associated with excessive settlements over time, emphasizing the likelihood of floor slab cracking, differential movement of the second stories, and distress to the exterior materials of the buildings.

I would provide the contractor with a written summary of my findings and recommendations based on the geotechnical analysis, highlighting the importance of implementing pile foundations to ensure the long-term stability and integrity of the structures. I would emphasize that my professional responsibility is to prioritize the safety and performance of the buildings over short-term cost considerations.

If the contractor continues to insist on using shallow footings despite my professional recommendation, I would document all communication and decisions made, ensuring that there is a clear record of my expert advice being disregarded. I would also consider consulting with legal counsel to understand my rights and obligations in this situation.

Ultimately, I would not compromise on the structural integrity of the project and would stand by my professional judgment, even if it means risking potential non-payment for my services.
