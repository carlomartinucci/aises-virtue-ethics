In this situation, as one of the engineers in the Gamma Group Omaha office, I would have:

1. Taken a moment to process the sudden announcement of Ralph and Dorph leaving and the potential impact on my own career and the office as a whole.

2. Reached out to the remaining management in the Gamma Group Omaha office to understand their plans for the future and express any concerns or questions I may have about the transition.

3. Considered my options carefully, weighing the stability and reputation of the Gamma Group against the potential opportunities and risks of joining Ralph and Dorph at Compass Associates.

4. Conducted my own research on Compass Associates, seeking information about their track record, company culture, and future prospects in order to make an informed decision.

5. Engaged in open communication with my colleagues to discuss our individual choices and possibly seek strength in numbers if we decide to stay at Gamma Group or move together to Compass Associates.

Regarding Ralph's actions, I feel that they were abrupt and potentially damaging to the Gamma Group Omaha office. His decision to leave suddenly without a clear transition plan in place and his wife's efforts to sway employees to follow them to Compass Associates appear to lack consideration for the impact on the rest of the team and the company.
