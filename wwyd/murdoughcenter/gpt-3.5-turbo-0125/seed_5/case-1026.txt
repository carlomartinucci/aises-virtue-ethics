Jack should immediately contact the drilling crew and geologists who conducted the subsurface explorations for the proposed office building complex. He should request a meeting with them as soon as possible to discuss the missing borings and clarify the discrepancies in the data provided. Jack should express the urgency of the situation and stress the importance of accurate and reliable information for his design recommendations.

Additionally, Jack should consider conducting a thorough review of the existing data and reports to identify any inconsistencies or gaps that may impact the foundation design recommendations. He should allocate additional time and resources to verify the accuracy of the information and ensure that his analyses are based on reliable data.

Furthermore, Jack should communicate with his client about the potential delay in submitting the foundation design recommendation report. He should provide updates on the situation and discuss any necessary adjustments to the timeline to maintain the quality and integrity of the project.

Overall, Jack should take immediate action to address the missing borings, verify the data accuracy, and communicate effectively with all stakeholders to mitigate any potential risks and uphold professional standards in his work.
