I would decline the offer from Mr. Owatadeel and International Affiliates Ltd. I would not authorize their exclusive involvement with Choice Engineering for obtaining the project. Instead, I would explore other options for establishing a local presence in Utopia that align more closely with ethical business practices and do not involve excessive fees or questionable practices such as providing gifts to key directors. I would seek out reputable local firms or individuals who can assist in representing Choice Engineering's interests in Utopia in a transparent and ethical manner.
