I would advise Turnbuckle to gather all the necessary documentation related to his work on the clock tower remediation project, including his engineering designs, correspondence with the various parties involved, and any relevant permits or licenses he held in other states. He should also seek legal counsel to understand the specific regulations and requirements for engineering practice in the state where the project took place.

Turnbuckle should then respond to the formal complaint filed by I. B. Stout with a detailed explanation of his qualifications, experience, and the circumstances surrounding his involvement in the project. He should provide evidence of his professional engineering registrations in other states and demonstrate that he acted in good faith to address the structural issues with the clock tower.

Additionally, Turnbuckle should cooperate fully with the state Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors, providing any additional information or documentation they may require to review his case. He should be transparent and forthcoming in his communication with the board to demonstrate his commitment to upholding professional standards and ethics in engineering practice.

Ultimately, Turnbuckle should be prepared to defend his actions and decisions during the clock tower incident, emphasizing his expertise and the successful outcome of the remediation project. He should also be open to any disciplinary measures or corrective actions deemed necessary by the board to address the issue of practicing without a license in the state.
