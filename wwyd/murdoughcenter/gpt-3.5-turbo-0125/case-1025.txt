I would decline the settlement offer from the adjacent property owner. I would continue to work with my lawyer to present all the evidence we have that shows my firm was not responsible for the alleged damages. I would also make sure to emphasize that we had advised the bank and its project manager both verbally and in writing about the need to obtain permission for the tiebacks and anchors. I would stand firm in defending my firm's position and would not agree to a settlement that implies any wrongdoing on our part.
