**Question 1:**
As the President of Nearby Engineers, I would decline to submit an additional proposal. Instead, I would communicate with the County Public Works Department to express my concerns about the deviation from the established QBS selection process and the implications it has for the integrity of the procurement process. I would request a meeting to discuss the situation and seek clarification on the rationale behind the decision to solicit a proposal from Nearby Engineers after Trueheart Engineers had already been selected.

**Question 2:**
As a professional engineer on the County Public Works Department staff, I would formally document my concerns regarding the Director's decision to override the selection process. I would request a meeting with the Director to discuss the ethical implications of this action and the potential impact on the integrity of the selection process. If my concerns are not addressed satisfactorily, I would consider escalating the issue to the Board of Supervisors or the relevant ethics committee within the professional organizations to which I belong.

**Question 3:**
As the Director of Public Works, I would first assess the situation and the reasons behind the instruction from the Board member. I would then convene a meeting with the Board of Supervisors to discuss the importance of adhering to the established QBS selection process and the potential negative consequences of bypassing it. If the Board insists on hiring Nearby Engineers, I would document my objections and the reasons for them, ensuring that there is a record of my concerns regarding the integrity of the process.

**Question 4:**
As the President of Trueheart Engineers, I would reach out to the County Public Works Department to request a formal explanation for the decision to select Nearby Engineers after Trueheart had already been chosen. I would express my disappointment regarding the time and resources spent on refining the scope of work and contract, and I would ask for a meeting to discuss the possibility of compensation for the work done, as well as to understand the rationale behind the change in selection. If necessary, I would also consider consulting with legal counsel regarding the situation.
