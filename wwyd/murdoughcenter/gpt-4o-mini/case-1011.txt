I would tell John Bigge that I appreciate his call and the opportunity to discuss the final engineering design for the project. I would express my interest in the project and my willingness to collaborate with him. However, I would also clarify that I need to review the preliminary report submitted by Weeks and Weeks and the planning commission's feedback before making any commitments. I would request a copy of the preliminary report and any comments from the planning commission to ensure that I fully understand the context and the specific concerns raised. After reviewing this information, I would follow up with him to discuss how I can best address the project's needs and any unrealistic recommendations that were identified.
