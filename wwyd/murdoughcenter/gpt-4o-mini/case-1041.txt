Carlos should take the following specific actions:

1. **Document Safety Concerns**: Carlos should immediately document his concerns regarding the safety of the construction site, particularly related to the inexperience of the Ecuadorian workers with concrete work. He should note any specific risks he identifies and the potential consequences of those risks.

2. **Communicate with Workers**: Carlos should have an open and honest conversation with the Ecuadorian workers about his concerns for their safety. He should explain the risks involved in the concrete work and encourage them to voice any concerns they may have.

3. **Propose a Safety Training Session**: Carlos should organize a brief safety training session for the workers, focusing on the specific tasks they will be performing with the concrete. He can use resources available online or from safety organizations to create a simple training outline.

4. **Seek External Help**: If possible, Carlos should reach out to a local construction safety expert or a colleague with experience in concrete work to provide guidance or oversight during the critical phase of the project. This could help ensure that the work is done safely and correctly.

5. **Report to Higher Management**: If the situation does not improve and Carlos feels that the safety risks are still too high, he should escalate the issue to higher management or the company's safety officer, if one exists. He should present his documented concerns and the potential liabilities involved in proceeding without addressing safety.

6. **Consider Whistleblowing**: If all else fails and he believes that the workers' safety is at serious risk, Carlos should consider reporting the situation to the appropriate labor or safety authorities, even if it risks his job. He should weigh the potential consequences of inaction against the moral obligation to protect the workers.

By taking these steps, Carlos can address the safety concerns while also showing his commitment to the well-being of the workers and the integrity of the project.
