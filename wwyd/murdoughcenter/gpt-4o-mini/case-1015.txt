In this scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Document the Findings**: I would prepare a detailed written report that includes my geotechnical analysis, the reasons for recommending pile foundations, and the potential long-term settlement issues associated with shallow footings. This report would include data from the subsurface investigation, test results, and any relevant calculations that support my recommendations.

2. **Communicate Clearly**: I would schedule a meeting with the contractor and the design-build team to present my findings in person. During this meeting, I would clearly explain the risks associated with using shallow footings, emphasizing the long-term implications for the structural integrity and aesthetics of the buildings.

3. **Highlight Responsibilities**: I would remind the contractor and the design-build team of their professional and legal responsibilities to ensure the safety and durability of the structures beyond the warranty period. I would stress that my duty as a geotechnical engineer is to prioritize the long-term performance of the buildings.

4. **Propose a Compromise**: If the contractor remains insistent on shallow footings, I would propose a compromise where I could include a disclaimer in my report stating that while I do not recommend shallow footings, I will provide the requested design if they acknowledge the potential risks and agree to take full responsibility for any future issues that arise from this decision.

5. **Escalate if Necessary**: If the contractor continues to pressure me to comply with their request without acknowledging the risks, I would escalate the issue to my supervisor or the project manager within my company. I would seek their guidance on how to proceed while ensuring that the integrity of my professional recommendations is maintained.

6. **Consider Reporting**: If the contractor threatens non-payment for my services based on my refusal to comply with their request, I would document this communication and consider reporting the situation to the appropriate regulatory or professional body, as it may involve unethical practices.

By taking these actions, I would ensure that I uphold my professional responsibilities while also attempting to navigate the pressures from the contractor.
