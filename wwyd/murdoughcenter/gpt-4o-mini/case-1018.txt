I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Document the Evidence**: I would create a detailed record of the identical project reports, noting the specific similarities in wording, punctuation, and errors. I would take screenshots or print copies of the reports for my records.

2. **Consult the Universityâ€™s Academic Integrity Policy**: I would review the university's academic integrity policy to understand the procedures for handling cases of academic dishonesty.

3. **Communicate with Students**: I would send an email to the students involved, informing them that I have noticed significant similarities in their reports and that I will be addressing this issue. I would ask them to meet with me individually to discuss their projects.

4. **Schedule Meetings**: I would set up individual meetings with each of the students to discuss their projects and understand their perspectives. This would allow me to gauge whether they were aware of the similarities and if they had any explanations.

5. **Prepare a Report for the Chair**: After gathering information from the meetings, I would prepare a report summarizing my findings and the students' responses. I would include my documentation of the identical reports and any relevant details from the meetings.

6. **Submit the Report**: I would submit this report to the department chair as soon as he returns, along with my recommendations for how to handle the situation, which may include academic penalties for the students involved.

7. **Grade the Projects**: I would assign grades based on the individual meetings and the quality of the work presented, ensuring that I follow the university's guidelines for academic integrity and fairness.

By taking these steps, I would address the issue of academic dishonesty while also adhering to university policies and maintaining a fair grading process.
