I would call the Elm Grove Gazette back and provide a clear and honest statement regarding the situation. I would acknowledge the pump failures and express my concern for the city and its residents. I would explain that the decision to specify the Pumpco pumps was made in collaboration with the city’s project manager, Dee Taylor, due to budgetary constraints and her strong recommendation. I would emphasize that while our firm had advocated for the Excelsior pumps based on their long-term benefits and reliability, we ultimately respected the city’s decision-making process. I would also offer to work with the city to address the pump failures and explore potential solutions, including assessing the situation and discussing options for replacement or repair. This approach maintains transparency and accountability while showing a commitment to supporting the city moving forward.
