Dianne should document her concerns regarding Warren's suggestion and the implications of altering the design to impact the old water main. She should prepare a detailed email outlining her understanding of the DOT policy regarding utility conflicts and the financial implications for Shadyvale. In this email, she should express her commitment to adhering to the policy and the ethical standards of her profession.

Next, Dianne should request a meeting with Warren to discuss her findings and concerns. During this meeting, she should present her email and emphasize the importance of following DOT policy for the integrity of the project and the potential consequences of deviating from it. She should also express her desire to find a solution that benefits Shadyvale without compromising ethical standards.

If Warren insists on proceeding with the design change despite her objections, Dianne should escalate the issue to a higher authority within the DOT, such as a supervisor or the ethics officer, to ensure that the matter is addressed appropriately and that the project remains compliant with state policies. This action will help protect her professional integrity and the interests of the citizens of Shadyvale.
