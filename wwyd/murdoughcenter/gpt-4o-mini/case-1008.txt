I would immediately document the incident in detail, including the time, location, and specific actions I observed Ira Klene performing at the monitoring wells. I would take note of the potential implications of his actions on the integrity of the groundwater data and the report I prepared.

Next, I would contact my supervisor or the appropriate authority within Enviroconcern, Inc. to report the incident. I would provide them with the documented evidence and express my concerns about the validity of the data and the ethical implications of Mr. Klene's actions.

After that, I would request a meeting with my supervisor and the legal counsel of Enviroconcern to discuss the next steps, including how to address the confidentiality clause in our contract with Industrial Solvents Ltd. while ensuring that the state regulatory agency is informed of the tampering with the monitoring wells.

Finally, I would prepare to present the findings of the incident to the state regulatory agency, ensuring that they are aware of the compromised data and the potential for misleading conclusions in the report. I would advocate for transparency and the need for further investigation into the groundwater pollution issue, regardless of the contractual obligations to Industrial Solvents Ltd.
