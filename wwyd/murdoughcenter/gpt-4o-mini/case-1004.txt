I would document my observations regarding the relationship between Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert, noting the timeline of their association with the Kinkora case and any potential conflicts of interest that may arise from their personal relationship. I would then communicate this information to Fulton Adams, emphasizing the importance of transparency and the potential implications for the integrity of the case. If necessary, I would suggest that he consider discussing this matter with legal counsel to determine if it should be disclosed to the court or if it could impact the credibility of Cleghorn's testimony.
