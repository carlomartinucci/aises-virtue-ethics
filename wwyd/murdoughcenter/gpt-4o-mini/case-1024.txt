Rod should report the observed gifts to Ethel Hicks, the supervisor at the DOT headquarters. He should do this as soon as possible, ideally on the following Monday morning after the weekend, to ensure that the information is communicated promptly. 

Rod can approach Ethel directly during her next site visit or contact her via email or phone if she is not available in person. In his communication, he should clearly describe what he has witnessed, including specific details about the items being placed in Upwright's truck and the frequency of these occurrences. This will provide Ethel with the necessary context to investigate the situation further. 

By taking this action, Rod fulfills his responsibility to report unethical behavior that could compromise the integrity of the project and the DOT.
