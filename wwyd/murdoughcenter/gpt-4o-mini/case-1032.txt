In this scenario, I would take the following specific action: I would organize a community meeting that includes both the residents affected by the Windsor Ridge development and the developers. During this meeting, I would facilitate a discussion about the potential impacts of the development on the poorer families living downstream, specifically addressing concerns about increased traffic and drainage issues. 

I would ensure that the meeting is publicized widely to encourage participation from all community members, including those who support the development and those who oppose it. My goal would be to create a platform for open dialogue where both sides can express their views and work towards a solution that considers the needs of the entire community. 

Additionally, I would propose that the developers conduct a more thorough impact assessment that includes the voices of the affected families, and I would advocate for mitigation strategies to address the concerns raised during the meeting. This way, I would be acting in the best interest of the community while also adhering to my professional responsibilities.
