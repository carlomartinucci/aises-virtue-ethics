In the morning, I will call Bill Broot and present a design contract amount of $28,500 for the new project. I will explain that this amount reflects the original contract price for the Dawson project, which is consistent with the scope of work we discussed. I will emphasize that this pricing is competitive and reflects the quality and reliability of our services, while also considering the previous work we have done for Universal International. 

Additionally, I will highlight that this amount allows us to maintain our standards and ensure that we can deliver the best possible results for the new project, while also being mindful of the budget constraints he mentioned. I will express my enthusiasm for continuing our partnership and my commitment to providing excellent service on this and future projects.
