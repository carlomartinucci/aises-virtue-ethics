In response to the situation, Arthur and David should take the following specific actions:

1. **Public Statement**: Arthur and David should issue a public statement clarifying their commitment to ethical practices. This statement should explicitly outline the steps they are taking to avoid any conflict of interest, including Arthur's abstention from any discussions or decisions regarding the awarding of contracts related to the courthouse project.

2. **Transparency**: They should hold a public meeting or forum where they can address the community's concerns directly. During this meeting, they should explain the process by which contracts will be awarded and how they are ensuring fairness and transparency in the selection process.

3. **Independent Oversight**: They should propose the establishment of an independent oversight committee to monitor the contract awarding process. This committee could include members from the community, other engineering professionals, and possibly representatives from the state or federal government to ensure impartiality.

4. **Documentation**: Arthur and David should document all communications and decisions related to the project, making this information available to the public to further demonstrate their commitment to transparency and ethical conduct.

5. **Engagement with Monroe**: They should reach out to Monroe directly to discuss his concerns and see if there is a way to address them collaboratively. This could involve inviting him to participate in the oversight committee or to provide input on the selection process.

By taking these concrete steps, Arthur and David can help mitigate concerns about conflicts of interest and reinforce their commitment to ethical practices in the revitalization efforts of Fairview.
