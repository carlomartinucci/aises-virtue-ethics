I would schedule a private meeting with Charlie Oxx to discuss my concerns about the expectation to contribute to the city council members' campaign funds. During this meeting, I would express my appreciation for the firm's success and my desire to support the team, but I would also clarify that I am uncomfortable with the idea of making political contributions as a condition of loyalty or job security. I would ask for guidance on how to navigate this situation while maintaining my professional integrity and commitment to the firm.
