Daulton should immediately schedule a meeting with Elias and Shellie to discuss the situation regarding their undisclosed property ownership. During this meeting, he should confront them directly about their conflict of interest and the ethical implications of their actions. He should emphasize the importance of transparency and the potential consequences for both their joint venture and ClearWater Developers if this information were to come to light. 

Daulton should insist that they disclose their property ownership to both Walbert Township and ClearWater’s management, as well as any other relevant stakeholders. He should document this conversation and their agreement to disclose the information. If they refuse to cooperate, Daulton must escalate the issue to ClearWater’s upper management, providing them with all the details and urging them to take appropriate action to mitigate any potential fallout. 

This approach ensures that the ethical breach is addressed directly and transparently, protecting the integrity of the project and the reputation of ClearWater Developers.
