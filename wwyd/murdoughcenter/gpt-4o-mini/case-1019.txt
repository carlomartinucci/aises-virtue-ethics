In this scenario, Tim should take the following specific actions:

1. **Document Observations**: Tim should keep a detailed record of all instances where he has observed Roy with the young woman, including dates, times, locations, and the context of the meetings. This documentation should be factual and objective, avoiding any assumptions about the nature of their relationship.

2. **Review Company Policies**: Tim should review the company's policies regarding conflicts of interest and relationships with subcontractors. This will help him understand the framework within which he can act and whether there are any existing guidelines that Roy may be violating.

3. **Consult with HR or Legal**: Tim should schedule a confidential meeting with the Human Resources department or the legal team to discuss his concerns. He should present his documented observations and seek guidance on how to proceed without making any accusations against Roy. This step is crucial to ensure that he is acting within company protocols and to protect himself from potential backlash.

4. **Monitor Project Performance**: Tim should closely monitor the performance of Hotspark Electrical on ongoing projects. He should look for any signs of compromised quality or preferential treatment that could be linked to Roy's relationship with the subcontractor.

5. **Prepare for a Follow-Up Conversation**: If the situation does not improve or if he finds evidence of wrongdoing, Tim should prepare for a follow-up conversation with Roy. He should approach this discussion with a focus on the quality of work and the importance of maintaining professional boundaries, rather than directly accusing Roy of misconduct.

6. **Escalate if Necessary**: If Tim finds concrete evidence of a conflict of interest or if the quality of work from Hotspark continues to decline, he should escalate the issue to higher management, including the president of the company, as he was informed that the president takes a personal interest in such matters.

By taking these steps, Tim can address his concerns about potential conflicts of interest while maintaining professionalism and protecting his position within the company.
