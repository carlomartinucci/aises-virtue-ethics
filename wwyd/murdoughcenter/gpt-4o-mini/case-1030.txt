Reilly should take the following specific action: 

He should document his observations regarding the electrical sockets, light switches, lighting fixtures, and junction boxes in the existing treatment room that do not appear to be explosion proof. Then, he should reach out to a qualified fire safety engineer or a professional with expertise in NFPA codes to get a second opinion on the classification of the room. 

After obtaining this expert opinion, if it confirms his concerns, he should prepare a concise report outlining the potential risks and necessary actions, including the implications for safety and compliance. He should then present this report to Dante, emphasizing the importance of addressing safety concerns, regardless of the potential delays or costs. 

This approach allows Reilly to act responsibly while ensuring that safety and compliance are prioritized, without directly confronting Dante or Bull in a way that could escalate tensions.
