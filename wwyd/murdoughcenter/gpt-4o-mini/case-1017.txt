Bert should take the following specific actions:

1. **Document the Evidence**: Bert should gather all relevant documentation that shows the original drawings he worked on at County Line Design, including any digital files, emails, or project records that can demonstrate the distinctiveness of the details and their origin.

2. **Notify Management**: Bert should schedule a meeting with his direct supervisor or the project manager at Far Horizons Engineering. During this meeting, he should present his findings, including the documentation he gathered, and explain that the detail sheets appear to be copied from his previous employer without permission.

3. **Suggest a Review**: Bert should recommend that the company conduct a thorough review of the drawings in question to determine their origin and whether they were used appropriately. He should advocate for transparency and compliance with intellectual property rights.

4. **Follow Up in Writing**: After the meeting, Bert should send a follow-up email summarizing the discussion and reiterating his concerns about the use of the drawings. This will create a formal record of his report and the company's acknowledgment of the issue.

5. **Monitor the Situation**: Bert should keep track of any actions taken by Far Horizons Engineering in response to his report and be prepared to escalate the issue if necessary, ensuring that the matter is addressed appropriately.

By taking these steps, Bert can ensure that he acts responsibly and ethically while protecting the intellectual property rights of his former employer.
