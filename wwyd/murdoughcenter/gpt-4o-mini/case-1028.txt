I would contact Creative Communications Corporation (CCC) to inquire about their service and sign up for the plan that allows for client-by-client or project-by-project billing. Specifically, I would:

1. Call CCC to discuss the details of their service, including how to set the internal markup percentage for long distance charges.
2. Determine a reasonable markup percentage that reflects the overhead costs associated with these calls, ensuring it is justifiable and transparent.
3. Set up the billing system to receive two separate bills: one for internal accounting and one to send to clients.
4. Inform my team about the new billing process and ensure they understand how to implement it for future projects.
5. When invoicing clients, I would include the CCC-generated bill with the markup as backup documentation for the long distance charges, ensuring clarity and transparency in our billing practices. 

This approach allows us to recoup some of the overhead costs associated with long distance calls while maintaining a clear and professional relationship with our clients.
