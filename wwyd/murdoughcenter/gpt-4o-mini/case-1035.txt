Robert should take the following specific actions:

1. **Document Everything**: Robert should immediately document all observations and communications related to the project, including his geotechnical report, the recommendations he provided, and any deviations from those recommendations that he has observed on site. This documentation should include photographs of the foundation work, notes on the construction practices, and any conversations he had with Walker, Larry, and Chuck.

2. **Communicate with Walker**: Robert should reach out to Walker to express his concerns about the foundation design and the lack of quality control monitoring. He should clearly explain how the current approach deviates from his geotechnical recommendations and the potential implications for the project. This conversation should be documented in writing (e.g., an email) to ensure there is a record of his concerns.

3. **Suggest a Qualified Engineer**: Robert should recommend that Walker and the construction team engage a qualified structural engineer to review the foundation design and ensure it aligns with the geotechnical findings. He should emphasize the importance of having a professional oversee the design and construction process to avoid potential issues in the future.

4. **Follow Up on Quality Control**: Robert should insist on the need for quality control measures for the remaining construction, particularly for the other barns and the residence. He should propose that his firm provide ongoing monitoring and testing services to ensure that the construction meets the necessary standards and that the geotechnical recommendations are followed.

5. **Prepare for Potential Liability**: Given the concerns about liability, Robert should consult with his firm's legal counsel to understand the implications of the current situation and to prepare for any potential claims that may arise from the project. This may involve discussing the documentation he has gathered and the communications he has had with the client.

By taking these actions, Robert can address his concerns about the project while also protecting himself and his firm from potential liability.
