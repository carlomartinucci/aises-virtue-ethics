**Question 1:**
If I accept the assignment from Zeller, I would determine my fee by considering the following specific actions: 
1. Review the scope of work required for Zeller's project and compare it to the previous project I completed for Hartwell.
2. Estimate the time and resources needed to adapt the existing solution for Zeller, factoring in any additional modifications or updates that may be necessary.
3. Set my fee based on a combination of my hourly rate multiplied by the estimated hours, plus a markup for the value of the intellectual property and expertise I am providing, ensuring it reflects the market rate for similar consulting services in the area. I would aim for a fee that is competitive yet fair, likely in the range of $30,000 to $40,000, considering the previous fee and the value of the work.

**Question 2:**
If Hartwell contacts me to participate with them, I would decide on the fee by taking the following steps:
1. Discuss the specific needs and expectations Hartwell has for the project, including any unique challenges they foresee.
2. Assess the value of my previous work for them and how it can be leveraged for this new project.
3. Propose a fee that reflects my previous engagement with them, likely starting at a similar base of $25,000, but I would also consider increasing it to account for the additional value I bring and the potential complexity of the new project, possibly suggesting a fee in the range of $30,000 to $35,000.

**Question 3:**
If I find out that Hartwell has decided not to bid on the project, my decision would change. I would then proceed with Zeller's project and set my fee based on the same criteria as in Question 1, but I would likely increase my fee slightly to reflect the fact that I am now the sole consultant for this project without competition from Hartwell. I would aim for a fee in the range of $35,000 to $45,000, considering the exclusivity of the work and the demand for my expertise in this specific construction problem.
