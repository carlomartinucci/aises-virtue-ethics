Julie should take the following specific actions:

1. **Document the Findings**: Julie should create a detailed written account of Brock's findings regarding the rusted clip angles, including any photographs or sketches that illustrate the condition of the granite veneer attachment. This documentation should be clear and factual, emphasizing the potential safety risks associated with the condition.

2. **Request a Meeting with Smith**: Julie should schedule an urgent follow-up meeting with Charles Smith to discuss the findings in person. During this meeting, she should express her concerns about the safety implications of the rusted clip angles and the potential liability issues that could arise if the building is sold without addressing these concerns.

3. **Advise on Safety Protocols**: In the meeting, Julie should recommend that Smith consider conducting a more thorough investigation of the entire building's cladding system before proceeding with the sale. She should emphasize that this is not just a matter of financial implications but also a critical safety issue for the future occupants and the public.

4. **Communicate the Risks**: Julie should clearly communicate the risks associated with the current condition of the building to Smith, including the potential for injury or damage if the granite veneer were to fail. She should stress that this information is crucial for the buyers to make an informed decision.

5. **Follow Up in Writing**: After the meeting, Julie should send a follow-up email summarizing their discussion and reiterating her concerns about the clip angles and the safety risks. This email should serve as a formal record of her warnings and recommendations.

6. **Consider Reporting to Authorities**: If Smith refuses to take action and insists on proceeding with the sale, Julie should consider whether it is necessary to report the findings to local building authorities or safety regulators, especially if there is an imminent risk to public safety.

7. **Evaluate Future Business Relationships**: Julie should reflect on her business relationship with Smith and consider the ethical implications of continuing to work with him if he chooses to ignore the safety concerns. She may need to prioritize the safety of the public and her professional integrity over the potential for future business.

By taking these actions, Julie can ensure that she has done her due diligence in addressing the safety concerns while also protecting her professional integrity and the well-being of the public.
