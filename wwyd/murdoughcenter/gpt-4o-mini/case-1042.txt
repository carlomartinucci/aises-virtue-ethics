Rashid should take the following specific actions:

1. **Document the Issue**: Rashid should take detailed notes about the specific beams that are covered by walls and the potential implications for the coating process. He should include dates, times, and any relevant observations about Gibb's presence and behavior on site.

2. **Gather Evidence**: Rashid should take photographs of the beams in question, clearly showing the areas that are inaccessible for coating. This visual evidence will support his concerns about the quality of work being performed.

3. **Request a Meeting with Riley**: Instead of casually mentioning his concerns, Rashid should formally request a brief meeting with Riley to discuss the coating issue. He should emphasize that he has gathered specific evidence and that it relates to both quality and safety.

4. **Present Findings Clearly**: In the meeting with Riley, Rashid should present his documented observations and photographs. He should explain the potential risks associated with the uncoated areas and how it could affect the integrity of the building.

5. **Propose a Solution**: Rashid should suggest that a re-inspection of the beams be conducted, possibly involving Janis again, to ensure that the coating has been applied correctly. He should frame this as a proactive measure to avoid future issues rather than a criticism of Gibb.

6. **Follow Up**: After the meeting, Rashid should follow up with Riley to ensure that the issue is being addressed. He should keep a record of any further communications regarding the coating and the subcontractor's performance.

By taking these steps, Rashid can address his concerns about quality and safety while also respecting the chain of command and the urgency of the project timeline.
