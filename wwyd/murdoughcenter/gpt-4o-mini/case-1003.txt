At this point, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Follow Up with Each Firm**: I would send a personalized thank-you email to each of the four firms I interviewed with, expressing my gratitude for the opportunity to interview and reiterating my enthusiasm for the position and the company. In this email, I would mention a specific aspect of our conversation that I found particularly engaging or relevant, to reinforce my interest.

2. **Network with Current Employees**: I would reach out to any connections I have within these firms or in the local area to gather insights about the company culture, work environment, and any potential updates on the hiring process. This could include LinkedIn messages or informal coffee chats.

3. **Prepare for Potential Offers**: I would start to outline my priorities and preferences regarding salary, benefits, and work-life balance, so that I am ready to evaluate any offers that come in. This would involve researching typical salaries for my role in that area and considering what is most important to me in a new position.

4. **Stay Engaged with My Future Spouse**: I would discuss the job search process with my future spouse to ensure we are aligned on timelines and any potential impacts on our relocation plans. This would help us both feel more secure and coordinated during this transition.

5. **Continue Job Searching**: While waiting for offers, I would keep my options open by continuing to search for other job opportunities in the area, just in case the offers from the four firms do not meet my expectations or if there are delays.

By taking these actions, I would be actively managing my job search and ensuring that I am well-prepared for any offers that may come my way.
