If I had been one of the engineers in the Gamma Group Omaha office, I would have taken the following specific actions:

1. **Evaluate My Position**: I would first assess my current role at Gamma Group, including my job security, relationships with clients, and potential for career growth. 

2. **Gather Information**: I would reach out to my manager or HR to understand the situation better, specifically regarding Ralph and Dorph's departure and any plans for the future of the Omaha office. I would want to know if there were any immediate plans for leadership or if the company was considering closing the office.

3. **Consider My Options**: After gathering information, I would weigh the pros and cons of staying at Gamma Group versus joining Compass Associates. This would include considering the stability of Gamma Group, the potential for new leadership, and the opportunities at Compass.

4. **Make a Decision**: If I felt uncertain about the future of Gamma Group and believed that my career would be better served at Compass Associates, I would decide to accept an offer from Compass. 

5. **Communicate Professionally**: If I chose to leave, I would formally resign from Gamma Group, providing appropriate notice and expressing gratitude for the opportunities I had there. I would ensure that my departure was professional and respectful, maintaining good relationships with my colleagues and management.

6. **Transition My Work**: I would offer to assist in transitioning my projects and responsibilities to ensure a smooth handover, demonstrating professionalism and respect for my former employer.

By taking these steps, I would ensure that I made an informed decision while maintaining professionalism throughout the process.
