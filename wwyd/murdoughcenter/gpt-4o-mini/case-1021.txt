I would conduct a thorough due diligence process on International Affiliates Ltd. to assess their legitimacy and reputation in Utopia. This would involve:

1. **Researching International Affiliates**: I would look for any available information on the company, including reviews, past projects, and any legal or ethical concerns associated with their operations. This could involve searching online databases, industry publications, and reaching out to contacts in the engineering community who may have experience working in Utopia.

2. **Contacting Local Professionals**: I would reach out to other engineering firms or professionals in Utopia to gather insights about International Affiliates and the general business practices in the region. This would help me understand if the fees and practices suggested by Owatadeel are standard or if they raise any red flags.

3. **Consulting with Legal Advisors**: I would consult with legal advisors who specialize in international business and compliance to ensure that any agreements or arrangements made with International Affiliates comply with both Utopian laws and international anti-corruption regulations.

4. **Evaluating Alternatives**: If the due diligence raises concerns about the legitimacy of International Affiliates or the proposed fees, I would explore alternative local partners who can provide the necessary representation in Utopia without compromising ethical standards.

5. **Making a Decision**: Based on the findings from the due diligence, I would either proceed with a partnership with International Affiliates if they are deemed reputable and the fees are justified, or I would seek another local firm or consider other strategies to enter the Utopian market without compromising the integrity of Choice Engineering. 

This approach ensures that I make an informed decision while safeguarding the reputation and ethical standing of Choice Engineering.
