Gwen should take the following specific action: 

She should schedule a meeting with Lawrence to discuss her concerns about the potential negative impact of accessing employees' email files. In this meeting, she should prepare to present specific points, including:

1. **Employee Morale**: Explain how this action could lead to a significant decline in employee trust and morale, potentially resulting in higher turnover rates.

2. **Productivity Concerns**: Provide data or examples showing that excessive monitoring can lead to decreased productivity, as employees may feel they are under constant surveillance.

3. **Legal and Ethical Implications**: Highlight any legal or ethical considerations regarding privacy and the potential backlash from employees if they feel their personal communications are being invaded.

4. **Alternative Solutions**: Propose alternative methods for addressing the issue of excessive personal email use, such as implementing a more robust email usage policy, conducting training sessions on appropriate email use, or using software that tracks email usage without accessing the content.

By taking this proactive approach, Gwen can express her concerns while also demonstrating her commitment to the company's success and the well-being of its employees.
