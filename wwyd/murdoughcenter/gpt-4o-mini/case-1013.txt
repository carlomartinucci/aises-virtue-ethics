I would document my concerns in writing and send an email to both my manager and the attorney at Dewey, Stickum & Howe, clearly stating that I believe the omission of the potential contamination information and the recommendation for a Phase 2 assessment is a significant oversight. I would express that while I understand the urgency of the refinancing, the potential environmental risks associated with the site should not be ignored, as they could have serious implications for public health and safety. I would request that this email be included in the final report documentation to ensure there is a record of my professional opinion on the matter. 

After sending the email, I would proceed to finalize the report as directed, but I would ensure that my concerns are formally documented to protect myself and my professional integrity.
