In response to the situation, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Document Everything**: I would immediately document the details of the conversation with John Dour, including the threats made regarding my professional license and the implications for future business relations. This documentation would include the date, time, and exact wording of the threats, as well as any relevant context.

2. **Consult Legal Counsel**: I would reach out to my firm's legal counsel to discuss the threats made by John Dour and to seek advice on how to protect my professional license and the firm’s interests. This would include understanding my rights and obligations in the mediation process and the implications of being coerced into a settlement.

3. **Prepare for Mediation**: I would prepare a clear and factual presentation of the technical evidence regarding the pile installation issues, emphasizing that my firm’s design recommendations were correct and that the problems stemmed from the contractor's actions and the quality of materials used. I would ensure that this presentation is ready to be shared during the mediation.

4. **Communicate with NW Developers**: I would inform NW Developers about the situation, including the threats made by Noall's president and the basis of my firm’s position regarding the claim. I would express my willingness to present the technical evidence at the mediation but clarify that I cannot agree to a financial settlement due to the lack of fault on my part.

5. **Attend the Mediation**: I would attend the mediation as requested, prepared to present the technical facts and evidence. I would remain firm in my position that my firm should not be financially liable for the claim, while also being open to discussing the technical aspects with all parties involved.

6. **Follow Up**: After the mediation, regardless of the outcome, I would follow up with my legal counsel to discuss any further actions that may be necessary to protect my professional standing and to address any potential repercussions from Noall Engineers.

By taking these actions, I would aim to protect my professional integrity and the interests of my firm while addressing the immediate situation effectively.
