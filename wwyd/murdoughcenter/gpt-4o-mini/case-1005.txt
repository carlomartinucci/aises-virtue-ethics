I would schedule a meeting with the Vice President for Operations to discuss the allocation of my time and the billing practices for both projects. During this meeting, I would express my concerns about the ethical implications of charging time to the Excaliber project while primarily working on the Wellfleet project. I would emphasize the importance of maintaining transparency and integrity in our billing practices, and I would suggest that we explore alternative solutions to ensure that both projects are completed within their respective budgets without compromising ethical standards. If the Vice President insists on proceeding with the current plan, I would document the conversation and my concerns in writing, and I would consider escalating the issue to a higher authority within the firm if necessary.
