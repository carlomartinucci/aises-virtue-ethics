Jack should take the following specific actions:

1. **Document the Situation**: Immediately take photographs of the site, including the prairie dog mounds and any other relevant features. Make detailed notes about the absence of the borings and the condition of the site.

2. **Contact the Drilling Crew**: Reach out to the drilling crew that was supposed to conduct the borings. Ask them for a detailed account of their work, including the exact locations of the borings, any issues they encountered, and confirmation of whether the borings were completed as per the project specifications.

3. **Verify the Boring Logs**: Request the original boring logs and any other documentation from the drilling crew to cross-check against the data provided to him. This will help determine if there was a mistake or if the borings were never conducted.

4. **Assess the Impact**: Evaluate how the lack of boring data affects the foundation design. If the data is critical and cannot be obtained in time, he should consider the implications for the project timeline and the safety of the design.

5. **Communicate with Management**: Inform his superiors at Welk Consultants about the situation, including the potential risks and the need for immediate action. This may involve discussing the possibility of conducting new borings if time allows.

6. **Plan for New Borings**: If the original borings cannot be verified or if they were not completed, arrange for a new drilling operation as soon as possible. Coordinate with the drilling manager to mobilize the crew to the site to conduct the necessary borings.

7. **Notify the Client**: If it becomes clear that the foundation design report will be delayed due to the lack of data, communicate transparently with the client about the situation, the reasons for the delay, and the steps being taken to resolve it.

By taking these actions, Jack can ensure that he addresses the issue of missing data responsibly and maintains the integrity of the engineering work.
