In this scenario, I would take the following specific action: I would reject the settlement offer of $15,000 from the adjacent property owner and instruct my lawyer to prepare for trial. I would emphasize to my lawyer that we have clear documentation and evidence showing that my firm advised the bank about the necessity of obtaining permission for the tiebacks, and that the responsibility for the encroachment lies with the bank and the contractor, not with my firm.

I would also ensure that my lawyer communicates this position to the adjacent property owner, reiterating that my firm acted in accordance with professional standards and that we have no liability in this matter. I would prepare to present our case in court, relying on the written design report and any other relevant documentation to support our defense.

In terms of identifying unethical actions, the bank and the contractor acted unethically by failing to obtain permission from the adjacent property owner before installing the tiebacks, despite being advised of the need to do so. This negligence led to the legal issues we are now facing.
