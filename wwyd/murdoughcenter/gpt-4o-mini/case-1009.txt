I would immediately contact Mr. Young to express my concern about the decision to go with a competitor based on the payment structure. I would request a meeting to discuss the implications of the chosen approach, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive foundation investigation for the safety and integrity of the proposed condominium. During the meeting, I would present a clear comparison of the value and thoroughness of my proposed scope of work versus the competitor's limited approach, highlighting potential risks associated with deferring costs and the importance of upfront investment in quality engineering. I would also offer to adjust my proposal to include a similar payment structure, if feasible, to remain competitive while ensuring the projectâ€™s integrity. If Mr. Young remains committed to the competitor, I would ask for feedback on my proposal to understand how I can improve future submissions.
