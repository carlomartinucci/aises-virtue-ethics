Sam should immediately schedule a meeting with Cal to discuss the current state of the business and the potential sale to Nemesis Engineering. During this meeting, Sam should be transparent about the financial difficulties In-Line Engineering is facing and the pressure he feels to sell the company. He should express his concerns about the proposed transition plan and the ethical implications of the actions being considered, particularly those that could harm employees and misrepresent the company's financial health.

In this meeting, Sam should also seek Cal's input on how to address the challenges posed by FBN Engineering without resorting to unethical practices. By involving Cal, who is known for his adherence to ethical standards, Sam can explore alternative strategies that prioritize the well-being of employees and the integrity of the business. This could include brainstorming ways to improve operations, enhance client relationships, and potentially seek out legitimate partnerships or investments that could stabilize the company without compromising its values. 

By taking this action, Sam can ensure that he is not making decisions in isolation and is considering the long-term implications for both the company and its employees.
