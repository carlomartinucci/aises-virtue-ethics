I would schedule a meeting with the Vice President for Finance at the university to discuss my concerns about the potential conflicts of interest and the lack of competitive bidding for the construction projects mentioned. During this meeting, I would present the information I learned over the weekend regarding the connections between university projects and personal construction work being done for university officials. I would express my concerns about the integrity of the bidding process and the implications it may have for the university's reputation and financial management. I would suggest that the university review its policies on contractor selection and ensure that all projects are awarded through a transparent and competitive process to avoid any appearance of favoritism or impropriety.
