Shariq should immediately contact Chuck Ashby to express his concerns about the situation with the drums. He should clearly state that he has observed the drums being loaded for disposal and that he believes there has been a serious breach of protocol regarding the testing of the samples he collected. 

Specifically, Shariq should take the following actions:

1. **Call Chuck Ashby**: Shariq should call Chuck and inform him that he has seen the drums being taken away without proper testing. He should emphasize that he has samples in his possession that have not been analyzed and that he believes the drums may contain hazardous materials.

2. **Request Immediate Action**: Shariq should insist that Chuck take immediate action to halt the disposal of the drums until the samples he collected can be tested. He should stress the potential legal and environmental implications of disposing of hazardous waste improperly.

3. **Document the Conversation**: After the call, Shariq should document the conversation in writing, including the date, time, and details of what was discussed, as well as any instructions given by Chuck.

4. **Prepare to Escalate**: If Chuck does not take appropriate action, Shariq should prepare to escalate the issue to higher management or the appropriate regulatory authorities, as necessary, to ensure that the situation is addressed properly.

By taking these steps, Shariq can help ensure that the environmental integrity of the site is maintained and that any potential hazards are properly managed.
