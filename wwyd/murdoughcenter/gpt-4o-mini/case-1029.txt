In this scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Schedule a Meeting with Eleanor**: I would arrange a private meeting with Eleanor to discuss her current situation and performance. I would approach this conversation with empathy, acknowledging her past contributions and the challenges she has faced recently.

2. **Assess Her Current Role**: During the meeting, I would ask Eleanor about her current workload, her feelings about her job, and any support she might need. I would also discuss her health and how it impacts her ability to perform her duties.

3. **Explore Alternative Roles**: If it becomes clear that Eleanor is unable to fulfill her current responsibilities, I would explore the possibility of transitioning her to a different role within the department that might be less demanding but still allows her to contribute meaningfully. This could involve administrative tasks that require less energy or a part-time position.

4. **Discuss Financial Options**: I would inform Eleanor about her pension eligibility and discuss any financial options available to her, including the possibility of early retirement if she feels that is a viable choice.

5. **Consult with HR**: After the meeting with Eleanor, I would consult with the Human Resources department to understand the legal and procedural implications of any changes to her employment status, including potential severance packages or retirement options.

6. **Communicate with Allan**: I would have a follow-up discussion with Allan to explain the steps I am taking to support Eleanor and to emphasize the importance of compassion in our decision-making process, while also considering the department's budgetary constraints.

7. **Monitor the Situation**: I would keep an open line of communication with Eleanor and the rest of the team to ensure that any changes are handled sensitively and that Eleanor feels supported throughout the process.

By taking these actions, I aim to balance compassion for Eleanor's situation with the operational needs of the Public Works department.
