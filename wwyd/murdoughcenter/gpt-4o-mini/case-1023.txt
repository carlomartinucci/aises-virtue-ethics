I would immediately schedule a meeting with my firm's leadership team to discuss the situation with Moover Design Consultants. During this meeting, I would present the information I learned from my acquaintance about Moover's practices regarding local subconsultants. I would emphasize the potential implications for our firm, including the risk of not receiving the expected work and the financial impact of the situation.

After discussing the situation with my leadership team, I would propose that we formally communicate our concerns to Moover. This would involve drafting a letter or email to I. B. Shaker, expressing our disappointment in the lack of communication and the unexpected reliance on their in-house team. I would request a clear outline of our expected role in the project moving forward and seek confirmation of our involvement in the design process.

If Moover does not respond satisfactorily or continues to exclude us from the project, I would recommend that we consider withdrawing from the exclusive arrangement and explore other opportunities for collaboration with different firms that value our expertise and contributions.
