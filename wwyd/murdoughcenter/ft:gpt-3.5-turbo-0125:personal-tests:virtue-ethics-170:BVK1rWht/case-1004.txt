I would inform Fulton Adams of the information I discovered about Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert's personal relationship. I would explain that they are sharing a room at a conference and have been living together since the Kinkora case started. I would emphasize that this information could potentially impact the objectivity and credibility of Cleghorn's testimony as an expert witness in the case. I would recommend that Adams consider raising this issue during the trial to challenge Cleghorn's impartiality and credibility.
