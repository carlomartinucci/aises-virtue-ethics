Bert should gather all the relevant evidence, such as the original drawings from his previous job at County Line Design and any communication or contracts related to the subcontracting work between County Line Design and Far Horizons Engineering. He should then schedule a meeting with his supervisor or a higher-up at Far Horizons to present his findings and express his concerns about the potential unauthorized use of the drawings. Bert should emphasize the importance of intellectual property rights and ethical business practices in the engineering industry. Additionally, he should suggest conducting a thorough investigation into the origin of the drawings and rectifying the situation by either obtaining proper authorization or creating new, original drawings for the projects in question.
