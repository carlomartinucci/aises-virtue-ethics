I would advise Roger to document his concerns and the sequence of events in writing, including his uneasiness about providing the draft report to Frank Bullock and his conversation with Bill Mason. This documentation should be kept for his own records and protection in case any issues arise in the future. Additionally, I would suggest that Roger refrain from sharing draft reports with individuals outside the project team without explicit approval from his direct supervisor or project manager to ensure confidentiality and integrity of the work.
