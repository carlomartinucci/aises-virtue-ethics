I would express my concerns to the Vice President for Operations about the ethical implications of charging my time to the Excaliber project while working primarily on the Wellfleet project. I would request a meeting with the Vice President to discuss the potential consequences of this decision, including the impact on the firm's reputation, client relationships, and the quality of work delivered to both Excaliber and Wellfleet. I would propose alternative solutions, such as reallocating resources or renegotiating the contracts, to ensure that both projects are completed successfully and ethically.
