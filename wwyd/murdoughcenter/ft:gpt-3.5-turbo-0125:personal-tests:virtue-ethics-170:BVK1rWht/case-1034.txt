Arthur and David should respond by immediately disclosing the potential conflict of interest to the Fairview CSC and the relevant government authorities overseeing the project. They should offer to recuse themselves from any involvement in the decision-making process regarding the awarding of engineering contracts for the courthouse/office building project. Additionally, they should publicly address Monroe's concerns by issuing a statement acknowledging the potential conflict of interest and emphasizing their commitment to transparency and ethical business practices. They should also seek guidance from legal counsel to ensure full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.
