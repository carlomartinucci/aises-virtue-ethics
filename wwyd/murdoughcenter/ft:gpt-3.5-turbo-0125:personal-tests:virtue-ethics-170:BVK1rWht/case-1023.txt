I would immediately document all communications and interactions with Moover Design Consultants, including the initial request to join their team, the agreement for an exclusive arrangement, the selection process, and the subsequent lack of communication and dismissive response from Chuck Cleaver. I would also gather any relevant project documents and correspondence related to the Fort Worth project.

Next, I would schedule a meeting with my firm's legal counsel to review the situation and discuss potential courses of action. I would seek advice on the best way to address the issue with Moover Design Consultants, including the possibility of terminating the agreement due to their lack of communication and apparent disregard for the agreed-upon terms.

Following the meeting with legal counsel, I would draft a formal letter to Moover Design Consultants expressing my concerns about the lack of communication, the discrepancy between the agreed-upon role and the actual involvement in the project, and the unprofessional response from Chuck Cleaver. I would clearly outline the expectations outlined in the initial agreement and request a meeting to discuss the situation and seek clarification on their intentions moving forward.

If Moover Design Consultants fail to respond satisfactorily or continue to disregard my concerns, I would consider escalating the issue further, potentially seeking mediation or legal action to address the breach of contract and ensure fair treatment for my firm.
