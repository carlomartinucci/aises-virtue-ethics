I would first gather more information about the situation by discreetly speaking with colleagues or researching the company's policies on political contributions. I would also seek advice from a mentor or HR representative within the company to understand the potential implications of not making the contribution. Based on the information gathered, I would then make a decision on whether to make the contribution, considering the ethical implications and potential consequences for my career at CWE.
