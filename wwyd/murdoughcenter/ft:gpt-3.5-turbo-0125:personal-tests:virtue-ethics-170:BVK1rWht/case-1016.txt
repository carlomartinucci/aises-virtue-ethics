Question 1:
As the President of Nearby Engineers, I would feel conflicted about submitting an additional proposal knowing that Trueheart Engineers have already been selected for the project by the Public Works staff. I would carefully consider the ethical implications of potentially undermining the selection process and the trust of the Public Works Department. I would also assess the potential impact on our reputation within the community and the engineering industry.

Question 2:
As a professional engineer on the County Public Works Department staff and a member of the interview/selection team for this project, I would raise my concerns about the Director of Public Works overturning the announced QBS selection process and my professional evaluation of the proposed consultants. I would present a formal report outlining the reasons why Trueheart Engineers were initially selected and express my reservations about the deviation from the established procedure. I would emphasize the importance of transparency, fairness, and integrity in the selection process to uphold the credibility of the Public Works Department.

Question 3:
As the Director of Public Works, upon being instructed by a member of the Board of Supervisors to hire Nearby Engineers regardless of the announced QBS selection procedure, I would respectfully push back against the directive. I would explain the importance of following the established selection process based on qualifications and experience to ensure the best outcome for the project and the community. I would advocate for upholding ethical standards and the integrity of the selection process, even if it means facing potential consequences from the Board of Supervisors.

Question 4:
As the President of Trueheart Engineers, I would first seek clarification from the County Public Works Department about the reasons for the delay and the sudden change in the selection of consultants. I would express my disappointment at the situation and the impact it has had on our firm's resources and commitments. I would also consider discussing the matter with legal counsel to explore any potential recourse or remedies available to address the situation, such as appealing the decision or seeking compensation for the time and effort invested in the project that was ultimately awarded to another firm.
