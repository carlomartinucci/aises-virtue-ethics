I would decline the offer from Mr. Owatadeel and International Affiliates Ltd. I would not authorize their exclusive involvement with Choice Engineering for obtaining the project. Instead, I would explore other options for establishing a local presence in Utopia that align more closely with ethical business practices and do not involve such high fees and questionable requests for marketing gifts. I would seek out alternative local firms or representatives who can assist in navigating the business landscape in Utopia without compromising the integrity of Choice Engineering's operations.
