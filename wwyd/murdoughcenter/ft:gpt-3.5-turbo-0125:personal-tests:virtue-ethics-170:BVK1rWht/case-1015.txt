I would firmly explain to the contractor the potential long-term consequences of using shallow footing foundations instead of piles, emphasizing the risk of future structural issues such as cracking and differential movement. I would provide detailed evidence from my analyses to support my recommendation for pile foundations. I would also highlight the importance of ensuring the long-term structural integrity of the buildings, even beyond the warranty period. If the contractor continues to insist on shallow footings, I would document our conversation and my professional recommendation in writing, clearly outlining the risks involved in deviating from the recommended foundation design. I would then consult with my supervisor or a senior engineer within my company to discuss the situation and seek guidance on how to proceed while upholding the integrity of my professional recommendations.
