Reilly should conduct further research and investigation to verify whether the existing treatment room is truly explosion proof according to the NFPA 820 code. He should consult with a fire safety expert or an engineer with expertise in explosion-proof design to assess the current state of the room's electrical components and confirm compliance with the code requirements. Reilly should document his findings and present a detailed report to Dante, highlighting any discrepancies or areas of concern. If necessary, Reilly should also reach out to the County Fire Code Official, Bobby Burns, for clarification and guidance on the matter. It is crucial for Reilly to prioritize the safety and compliance of the wastewater treatment plant, even if it may lead to additional project delays or costs.
