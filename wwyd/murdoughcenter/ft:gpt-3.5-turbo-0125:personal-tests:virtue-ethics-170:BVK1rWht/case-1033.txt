I would advise Dianne to maintain her integrity and adhere to the State DOT policy regarding utility conflicts. She should not change the design to impact Shadyvale's old water main in order to shift the cost burden to the State DOT. Dianne should prioritize following the established guidelines and ensuring that the project is carried out in a fair and transparent manner. She should communicate her concerns to Warren, explaining the implications of altering the design and the potential ethical issues involved. Dianne should seek guidance from her superiors or the appropriate authorities within the State DOT if necessary to address the situation effectively and ethically.
