I would first gather all the identical project reports submitted by the students and carefully compare them side by side to confirm the extent of the plagiarism. I would then schedule individual meetings with each of the seven students who submitted the identical reports to discuss the issue. During these meetings, I would clearly explain the evidence of plagiarism and ask each student to provide an explanation for the similarities in their reports.

Based on the students' responses and the university's academic integrity policies, I would determine the appropriate consequences for each student involved in the plagiarism. This could include failing the project, receiving a reduced grade for the course, or facing disciplinary action as outlined by the university's policies.

I would document the meetings with the students, detailing their explanations and the actions taken as a result of the plagiarism. I would then submit a report to the department chair, outlining the situation, the evidence of plagiarism, and the actions taken to address it. I would also recommend implementing measures to prevent future instances of plagiarism in the department's courses.
