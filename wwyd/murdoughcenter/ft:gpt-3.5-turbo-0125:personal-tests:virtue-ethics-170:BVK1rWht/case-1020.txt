I would attend the mediation hearing as requested by Noall's attorney and present the technical facts related to the pile design recommendations made by my firm. I would make it clear that my firm was not at fault for the issues encountered during pile driving, and that we do not feel financially obligated to contribute to the settlement. I would stand firm on the evidence uncovered and advocate for a fair resolution based on the facts presented.
