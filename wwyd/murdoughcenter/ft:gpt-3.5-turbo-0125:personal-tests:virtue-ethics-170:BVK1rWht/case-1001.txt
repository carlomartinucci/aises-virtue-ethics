I would advise Turnbuckle to gather all the necessary documentation related to his work on the clock tower remediation project, including his engineering designs, correspondence with the local authorities, and any other relevant information. He should then seek legal counsel to review the situation and determine the best course of action to respond to Stout's complaint. Additionally, Turnbuckle should be prepared to provide evidence of his qualifications and experience as a professional engineer in other states to demonstrate his competence in handling the project. If necessary, he should be ready to cooperate with the state Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors to resolve the issue and ensure compliance with the state's licensing requirements.
