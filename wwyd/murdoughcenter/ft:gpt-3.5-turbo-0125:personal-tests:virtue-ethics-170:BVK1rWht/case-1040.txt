I would advise Ethan to schedule a meeting with Marc to discuss the field changes that have been authorized and express his concerns about the substitution of electronics hardware that he sees as inferior. Ethan should present his reasons for why he believes the original specifications should be adhered to and emphasize the importance of maintaining the quality of materials and design in the project. Ethan should also propose a collaborative approach to resolving the issue, such as seeking input from both the engineering and construction teams to find a solution that meets both quality standards and cost considerations. Additionally, Ethan should suggest revisiting the project agreement to explicitly address how design conflicts should be handled in the future to prevent similar issues from arising.
