Gwen should schedule a meeting with Lawrence to express her concerns about the potential breach of trust and invasion of privacy that accessing employees' email files without their consent would entail. She should explain the importance of respecting employees' privacy and the potential negative consequences of such actions on employee morale and trust in the company. Gwen should propose alternative solutions to address the issue of excessive personal use of email, such as implementing clearer guidelines or monitoring software that flags inappropriate email usage without directly accessing the content of emails. She should emphasize the need to balance monitoring with respecting employees' privacy rights and maintaining a positive work environment.
