I would first try to have a private conversation with the Ecuadorian workers to understand their concerns and assess their willingness to continue working on the project despite the risks involved. I would then document their situation and the safety concerns in writing, including the lack of experience with concrete work and the absence of worker's compensation and medical insurance.

Next, I would schedule a meeting with the local labor authorities to seek advice on how to proceed legally and ethically in this situation. I would present the documented concerns and ask for guidance on the best course of action to ensure the safety and well-being of the workers while complying with the law.

Finally, I would have a follow-up meeting with my boss to present the recommendations from the labor authorities and discuss the importance of prioritizing worker safety and legal compliance. I would emphasize the potential risks involved in continuing with the current workforce and propose alternative solutions, such as hiring qualified workers or providing additional safety training.

If my boss remains adamant about completing the project with the current workers, I would consider escalating the issue to higher management or seeking external legal advice to protect the workers and uphold ethical standards in the workplace.
