I would refuse to comply with the directive from my manager to issue the final report as revised by the Dewey legal firm. Despite the pressure and potential consequences outlined by the client's attorney, I cannot in good conscience ignore the potential environmental contamination issue that was brought to my attention during the course of my work. The fact that the property is not being sold does not negate the importance of addressing any potential risks associated with the site, especially if it is being used as collateral for a refinancing loan.

I would inform my manager that I cannot proceed with issuing the final report without including the recommendation for a Phase 2 site assessment to investigate the alleged creosote contamination. I would emphasize the importance of upholding environmental standards and ensuring the safety of the surrounding community, regardless of the financial implications for the client. If necessary, I would be willing to accept any consequences for my decision, as I believe it is crucial to prioritize environmental integrity over financial considerations in this situation.
