Question 1:
If I accept the assignment from Zeller, I would first assess the scope of work required for the project, considering the similarities to the previous project for Hartwell. I would then calculate the estimated time and resources needed to develop a solution for Zeller. Based on this assessment, I would determine a fair fee that reflects the value of my expertise and the potential cost savings or profit generation for Zeller from implementing the solution.

Question 2:
If contacted by Hartwell to participate with them, I would consider the past successful collaboration with them and the potential benefits of working with a known client. I would review the scope of work they require and assess the level of effort needed to provide a solution for them. Taking into account the previous fee structure and the current market rates for similar services, I would negotiate a fee that is fair to both parties and reflects the value of my expertise.

Question 3:
If I find out that Hartwell has decided not to bid on the project, my decision on the fee would be influenced by the reduced competition for the project. I would consider the potential impact of this reduced competition on the value of my services to Zeller. I may adjust the fee slightly to reflect the changed circumstances and the potential value of my expertise in helping Zeller secure the project without competition from Hartwell.
