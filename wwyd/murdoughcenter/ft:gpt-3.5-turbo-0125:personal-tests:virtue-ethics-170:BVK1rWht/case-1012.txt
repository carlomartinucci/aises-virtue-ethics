I would immediately gather all relevant documentation related to the selection of the pumps, including emails, meeting minutes, and any reports detailing the decision-making process. I would then schedule a meeting with my project engineer, Florence Moore, to discuss the situation and review the reasons why Excelsior Pumps were initially specified over Pumpco. I would also review any correspondence with the city's project manager, Dee Taylor, regarding the pump selection.

Next, I would contact the city of Elm Grove to request a meeting with the public works engineer, Stan Uprite, and the project managers to discuss the pump failures and determine the root cause of the issue. During the meeting, I would present the documentation supporting the selection of Excelsior Pumps and explain the long-term advantages and life-cycle savings associated with their use.

I would offer to conduct a thorough investigation into the pump failures to identify any design flaws or installation issues that may have contributed to the repeated failures. I would also propose a plan to rectify the situation, whether it involves repairing or replacing the pumps with a different manufacturer.

Finally, I would prepare a statement for the Elm Grove Gazette emphasizing our firm's commitment to quality and integrity in the design and construction of the wastewater treatment plant. I would take responsibility for the pump failures and express our willingness to work with the city to find a satisfactory solution to the issue.
