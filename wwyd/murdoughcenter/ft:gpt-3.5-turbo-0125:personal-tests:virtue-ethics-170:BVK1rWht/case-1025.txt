I would decline the settlement offer from the adjacent property owner and proceed to trial. I would continue to work closely with my lawyer to present all the evidence we have that shows my firm advised the bank and its project manager to obtain the necessary permission for installing the tiebacks. I would also emphasize that we made this recommendation in writing in the design report for the project. During the trial, I would make sure to clearly communicate our firm's actions and responsibilities in the situation, highlighting that we acted ethically by advising the bank of the proper procedures to follow. I would also stress that the adjacent property owner's refusal to release my firm from the lawsuit is unjust, given the evidence we have to support our position.
