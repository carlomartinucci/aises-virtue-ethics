I would schedule a meeting with Janis, the building inspector, to discuss my concerns about the potentially uncoated portions of the steel beams. During the meeting, I would present the evidence I have gathered and express my worries about the safety implications of this oversight. I would seek Janis's guidance on how to address the issue effectively while ensuring that the project stays on track. Additionally, I would ask for her support in conducting a thorough inspection of the steel beams to verify their coating status and rectify any deficiencies.
