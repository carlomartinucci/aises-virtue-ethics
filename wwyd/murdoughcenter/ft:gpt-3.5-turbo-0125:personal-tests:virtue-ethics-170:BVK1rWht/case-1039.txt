I would immediately contact Chuck and inform him that the drums have not been tested for hazardous materials as claimed by the remediation contractor. I would explain the situation clearly and provide any necessary evidence to support my claim. I would emphasize the importance of handling the drums properly and following the legal procedures for disposal of hazardous waste. Additionally, I would offer to provide the samples I collected for testing to ensure accurate results and proper disposal of the drums.
