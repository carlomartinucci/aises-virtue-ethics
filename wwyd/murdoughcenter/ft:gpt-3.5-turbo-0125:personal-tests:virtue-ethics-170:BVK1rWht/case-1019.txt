I would schedule a meeting with the president of Global Engineering and Construction to discuss my concerns about the potential conflict of interest involving Roy and Hotspark Electrical. During the meeting, I would present the observations I have made regarding Roy's interactions with the young woman who is the general manager of Hotspark Electrical. I would also express my worries about the possibility of preferential treatment being given to Hotspark at the expense of the firm's interests. I would seek guidance from the president on how to proceed in a manner that upholds the company's integrity and ensures that all projects are executed fairly and without bias.
