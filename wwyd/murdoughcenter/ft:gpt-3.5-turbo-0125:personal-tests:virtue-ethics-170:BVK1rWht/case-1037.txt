I would inform Fulton Adams about what I observed at the engineering society conference regarding Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert. I would provide him with the information I gathered discreetly about their living situation and the potential conflict of interest that may exist between them. I would recommend that this information be shared with the legal team representing Wastewater Treatment Systems so they can decide how to proceed with this new knowledge in the upcoming trial.
