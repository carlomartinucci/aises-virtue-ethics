I would document the instances of the foremen putting items in the back of the resident engineer's pickup truck on Fridays. I would then report this information to Ethel Hicks, Upwright's supervisor at the DOT headquarters, as soon as possible. I would provide specific details about the items being placed in the truck and the frequency of these occurrences.
