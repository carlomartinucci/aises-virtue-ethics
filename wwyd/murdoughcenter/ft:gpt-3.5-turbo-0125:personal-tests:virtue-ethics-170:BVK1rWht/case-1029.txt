I would first schedule a private meeting with Eleanor to discuss her current situation and performance. I would express my understanding and sympathy for the challenges she is facing and acknowledge her past contributions to the department. I would then discuss the concerns raised by Allan regarding her current role and performance.

During the meeting, I would explore potential options to support Eleanor during this difficult time. This could include adjusting her responsibilities to better align with her current capabilities and health status, providing additional training or resources to help her improve her performance, or exploring alternative roles within the department that may be a better fit for her current situation.

I would also consult with HR to understand the specific regulations and options available within the civil service system to provide support to Eleanor while ensuring the department's operational needs are met. If necessary, I would seek approval from higher management or the City Manager to explore alternative solutions that may not be explicitly outlined in the regulations.

Ultimately, I would strive to find a compassionate and practical solution that balances the needs of the department with supporting Eleanor during her challenging circumstances.
