I would inform Bill Broot in the morning that the cost estimate for the new project site, considering the reuse of information and analyses from the Dawson site, would be $22,800. I would explain the breakdown of the estimate and the rationale behind the reduced cost, emphasizing the value added by the prior work done for the Dawson site. I would also express my willingness to discuss any concerns or adjustments he may have regarding the proposed contract amount.
