I would express my disappointment to Mr. Young for not informing me about his decision to give the scope of work to a competitor. I would then ask for a meeting with Mr. Young to discuss the situation further and to understand his reasoning behind choosing the competitor over my firm. During the meeting, I would emphasize the value and expertise that my firm brings to the project and try to negotiate a revised agreement that is fair to both parties. If Mr. Young is unwilling to reconsider, I would thank him for the opportunity to work on the project and gracefully accept the outcome.
