I would first gather all the information I have heard from Alice, Ted, and my wife about the potential conflicts of interest involving Shreud Contractors, Gus Olson, Ray Vandergrafft, and Fred Facade. I would then discreetly verify the details of these projects and relationships by checking public records, such as building permits and contracts, to confirm the accuracy of the information shared.

Next, I would schedule a meeting with the University President and the Vice President for Finance to discuss the concerns raised about possible conflicts of interest and favoritism in the construction projects involving Shreud Contractors and the University Architect's personal connections. During the meeting, I would present the verified information and express my concerns about the integrity of the procurement process and the potential impact on the university's reputation.

I would recommend conducting a thorough investigation into the contracting practices of the university, specifically focusing on the projects mentioned by Alice and Ted. I would offer my assistance in providing any additional information or insights that could help uncover any unethical behavior or violations of procurement policies.

Finally, I would emphasize the importance of transparency, fairness, and accountability in the university's construction projects to ensure that public funds are being used appropriately and that all contractors are selected based on merit and competitive bidding processes.
