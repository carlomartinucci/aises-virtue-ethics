Daulton should immediately schedule a meeting with Elias and Shellie to address the conflict of interest situation. During the meeting, Daulton should confront them about their failure to disclose their ownership of the property that stands to benefit from the construction of the new road. Daulton should express his disappointment in their lack of transparency and emphasize the importance of ethical behavior in their professional roles. Daulton should make it clear that their actions have put the entire project at risk and that they need to rectify the situation immediately.

Daulton should request that Elias and Shellie recuse themselves from any further involvement in the decision-making process regarding the new road and the property acquisition. Daulton should also inform them that he will be reporting the situation to the appropriate authorities within ClearWater Developers to ensure that the issue is addressed and that proper measures are taken to prevent similar conflicts of interest in the future.

Additionally, Daulton should inform Conner about the conflict of interest situation and provide him with all the necessary information regarding Elias and Shellie's ownership of the property. Daulton should work with Conner to revise the property acquisition plans to exclude the parcel owned by Elias and Shellie's joint venture. Daulton should ensure that the revised plans are in compliance with all legal and ethical standards before proceeding with the property purchase.

Overall, Daulton must prioritize transparency, integrity, and ethical conduct in handling this conflict of interest situation to protect the reputation and success of ClearWater Developers and the ongoing project.
