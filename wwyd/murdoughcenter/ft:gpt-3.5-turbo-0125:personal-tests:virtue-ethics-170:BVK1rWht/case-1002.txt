I would have expressed my concerns and objections to Ralph about the sudden departure and recruitment of employees from the Gamma Group Omaha office to Compass Associates. I would have emphasized the importance of transparency, loyalty to the current employer, and ethical behavior in professional relationships. Additionally, I would have reported the situation to the management of the Gamma Group to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to address the sudden loss of employees and potential client relationships.
