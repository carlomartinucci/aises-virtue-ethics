Jack should immediately contact the drilling crew and geologist who conducted the borings for the project. He should request a meeting with them as soon as possible to discuss the missing borings and clarify the discrepancies in the data provided. Jack should also request any additional information or documentation related to the borings that could help him verify the accuracy of the subsurface exploration logs. Additionally, Jack should inform his client about the situation and discuss the possibility of extending the deadline for the foundation design recommendation report due to the unforeseen issues with the data collection process.
