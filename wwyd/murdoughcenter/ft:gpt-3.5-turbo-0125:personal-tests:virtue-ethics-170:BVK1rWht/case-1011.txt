I would thank John Bigge for considering me for the final engineering design of the project. I would express my interest in the opportunity and ask for more details about the specific concerns raised by Weeks and Weeks in their preliminary recommendations. I would also inquire about the timeline for the project and any other relevant information needed to make an informed decision. Additionally, I would request a meeting with John Bigge to discuss the project in more detail and clarify any questions or issues before committing to the final engineering design work.
