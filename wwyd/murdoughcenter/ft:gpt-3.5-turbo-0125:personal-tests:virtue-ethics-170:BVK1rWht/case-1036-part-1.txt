I would advise Sam to immediately halt all discussions and plans related to the transition plan proposed by Max. Sam should schedule a meeting with his lawyer and financial advisor to discuss the situation and explore alternative solutions to address the financial challenges faced by In-Line Engineering. Sam should also inform the board of directors, if applicable, about the current state of affairs and seek their input on potential strategies to save the company. It is crucial for Sam to prioritize transparency, honesty, and ethical business practices in navigating this difficult situation.
