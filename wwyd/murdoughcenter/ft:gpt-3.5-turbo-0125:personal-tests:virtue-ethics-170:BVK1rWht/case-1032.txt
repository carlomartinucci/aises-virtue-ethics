I would schedule a meeting with the design engineers responsible for the Windsor Ridge development to discuss the potential adverse impacts on the downstream community. During the meeting, I would propose modifications to the plans that could mitigate these impacts, such as implementing additional drainage solutions or traffic management measures. I would also request a thorough analysis of the proposed changes to ensure they meet all necessary codes and regulations. If the modifications are feasible and effective, I would work with the engineers to update the plans accordingly before making a final decision on approving the development.
