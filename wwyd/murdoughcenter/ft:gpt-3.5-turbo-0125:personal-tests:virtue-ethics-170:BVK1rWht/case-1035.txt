Robert should schedule a meeting with his boss/office manager, James, to discuss his concerns about the over-designed foundation and the potential liability issues that may arise from the construction of the remaining buildings on the project. During the meeting, Robert should present his analysis of the situation, including the discrepancies between his geotechnical recommendations and the actual construction, as well as the lack of a qualified design team and quality control measures in place. Robert should propose that the firm consider withdrawing from the project to avoid further involvement in a situation where the client is not following the recommended engineering practices. Additionally, Robert should suggest that the firm review its client selection process to ensure that future projects are with clients who are willing to adhere to professional engineering standards.
