I would advise Julie to contact the local building authorities or a structural engineering regulatory body to report the safety hazard of the rusted clip angles on the Inverness Block. This action would ensure that the potential risk to public safety is addressed, regardless of the implications it may have on the business deal or her relationship with Charles Smith. Public safety should be the top priority in this situation.
