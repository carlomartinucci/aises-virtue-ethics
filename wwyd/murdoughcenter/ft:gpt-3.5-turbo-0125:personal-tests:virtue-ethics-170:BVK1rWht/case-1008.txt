I would immediately contact my supervisor and the legal department within my firm to inform them of the situation. I would provide a detailed account of what I witnessed at the Industrial Solvents site, including Mr. Klene's actions of tampering with the monitoring wells. I would emphasize the potential impact on the accuracy and reliability of the data presented in the final report. I would request guidance on how to proceed with the upcoming presentation to the state regulatory agency, considering the breach of data integrity and the confidentiality clause in the contract with Industrial Solvents Ltd.
