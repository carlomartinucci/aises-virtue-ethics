After the fundraising dinner, I would schedule a meeting with Mary to discuss the interaction with Robert. During the meeting, I would suggest drafting a follow-up email to Robert, thanking him for his generous donation and providing more specific information about Casa Tia Maria's mission and the population it serves. In the email, we would clarify that the shelter primarily supports Central American immigrants in need of temporary housing and assistance.

Additionally, I would propose conducting a training session for all staff involved in fundraising activities to ensure they are well-informed about the organization's mission and the demographics of the individuals served by Casa Tia Maria. This training would focus on effective communication strategies to address potential misunderstandings with donors and emphasize the importance of transparency in fundraising efforts.

Furthermore, I would recommend creating a protocol for handling similar situations in the future. This protocol would outline guidelines for correcting misperceptions in real-time during donor interactions and strategies for maintaining open and honest communication with potential donors. By implementing these measures, we can ensure that all staff members are equipped to handle similar situations ethically and transparently, thereby upholding the integrity of Casa Tia Maria's mission and fostering stronger relationships with donors based on mutual understanding.
