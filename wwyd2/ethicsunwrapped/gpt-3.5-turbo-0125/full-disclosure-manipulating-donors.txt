I would discreetly approach Mary after the fundraising dinner and suggest that we immediately reach out to Robert to clarify the population served by Casa Tia Maria. I would recommend drafting an email to Robert, thanking him for his generous donation and providing more specific information about the organization's mission to support Central American immigrants in need of temporary shelter. In the email, I would emphasize the importance of inclusivity and highlight the valuable impact that his contribution will have on the immigrant community. Additionally, I would propose setting up a meeting with Robert to further discuss Casa Tia Maria's work and address any questions or misconceptions he may have. This direct communication would ensure transparency and accuracy in our interactions with donors, fostering a more informed and mutually beneficial relationship.
