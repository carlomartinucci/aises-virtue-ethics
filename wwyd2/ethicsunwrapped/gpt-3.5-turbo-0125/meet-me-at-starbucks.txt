I would immediately reach out to Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson to offer a sincere apology on behalf of Starbucks. I would arrange a meeting with them to listen to their experiences, express empathy, and discuss potential avenues for making amends. During this meeting, I would offer financial compensation to cover any legal fees incurred and provide support for any emotional distress caused by the incident.

In addition, I would conduct a thorough review of Starbucks' policies and procedures related to customer interactions and diversity. Any identified gaps or shortcomings would be addressed through targeted retraining programs for all employees, focusing on recognizing and addressing implicit bias. To ensure the effectiveness of these programs, I would implement a system for ongoing monitoring and evaluation.

Furthermore, I would engage with community leaders, civil rights organizations, and diversity experts to develop a comprehensive plan for promoting diversity and inclusion within Starbucks. This plan would include initiatives such as community outreach programs, partnerships with local organizations, and regular diversity training sessions for employees at all levels of the organization. By fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect, we can work towards creating a safe and welcoming environment for all customers, employees, and stakeholders.
