To address the incident at the Starbucks location in Philadelphia, I would first conduct a thorough investigation into the events that led to the wrongful arrest of Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson. This investigation would involve reviewing security footage, interviewing the employees involved, and speaking with witnesses to gather all relevant information.

Upon identifying any policy or training lapses that contributed to the incident, I would take immediate corrective action. This would include retraining employees on company policies regarding customer interactions, diversity, and inclusion. Any employees found to have acted inappropriately or discriminated against the two men would face appropriate disciplinary measures.

I would reach out to Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson to offer a sincere apology on behalf of Starbucks and discuss ways to make amends for the unjust treatment they experienced. This may involve offering compensation, providing support for any legal fees incurred, and engaging in a dialogue to address their concerns and ensure that such incidents do not happen again in the future.

Additionally, I would collaborate with community leaders, civil rights organizations, and diversity experts to develop a comprehensive plan for addressing implicit bias and discrimination within Starbucks. This plan would include ongoing training for employees, community outreach initiatives, and regular assessments of the company's progress in creating a safe and welcoming environment for all customers.
