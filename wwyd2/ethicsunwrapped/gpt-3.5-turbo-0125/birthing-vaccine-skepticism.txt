I would immediately compile all the evidence of Andrew Wakefield's unethical behavior, including his failure to disclose conflicts of interest and manipulation of research data. I would then submit a detailed report to the General Medical Council, urging them to conduct a thorough investigation into Wakefield's actions and consider revoking his medical registration. Additionally, I would reach out to reputable scientific journals and organizations to inform them about Wakefield's misconduct and request that they retract any publications that promote his discredited theories. By taking these steps, I aim to hold Wakefield accountable for his actions, prevent the spread of misinformation, and protect public health from the harmful effects of vaccine hesitancy.
