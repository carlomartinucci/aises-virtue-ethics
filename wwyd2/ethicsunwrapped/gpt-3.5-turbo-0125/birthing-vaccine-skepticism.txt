In addition to reporting Andrew Wakefield's unethical behavior to the General Medical Council and contacting relevant medical journals to retract the fraudulent research article, I would also advocate for the implementation of mandatory disclosure policies for conflicts of interest in research. This would involve working with scientific organizations and institutions to establish clear guidelines requiring researchers to disclose any financial or personal interests that could potentially bias their work. By promoting transparency and accountability in research practices, we can help prevent future instances of misconduct and protect the integrity of scientific findings.
