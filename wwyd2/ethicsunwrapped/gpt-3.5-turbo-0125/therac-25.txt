I would immediately contact the FDA and other regulatory authorities to report the incidents involving the Therac-25 machines. I would recommend forming a multidisciplinary team consisting of software engineers, medical professionals, and regulatory experts to conduct a thorough investigation into the software design, testing procedures, and safety features of the machines. This team would work collaboratively to identify the root causes of the issues and develop a comprehensive plan to address them.

In addition, I would prioritize transparency by communicating openly with patients, healthcare providers, and the public about the incidents and the steps being taken to rectify the situation. This transparency would help rebuild trust and credibility in the company and the healthcare system.

Furthermore, I would emphasize the importance of accountability within the company by identifying responsible parties at all levels and ensuring that corrective actions are taken to prevent similar incidents in the future. Implementing regular audits and monitoring of the machines, along with ongoing training for staff on safety protocols, would be crucial in maintaining compliance with safety standards and ensuring long-term patient safety.
