In addition to establishing a dedicated academic support program for the student-athletes impacted by the academic fraud at UNC, I would also initiate a comprehensive investigation to identify and hold accountable all individuals involved in the fraudulent practices. This investigation would involve reviewing communication records, conducting interviews with key personnel, and collaborating with external auditors to ensure transparency and thoroughness in the process.

Furthermore, I would implement a system of checks and balances within the academic department to prevent future occurrences of academic fraud. This would include regular audits of coursework, syllabi, and grading practices to ensure compliance with academic standards and integrity. Additionally, I would introduce mandatory training programs for faculty and staff on ethical conduct, academic integrity, and the importance of upholding educational values.

By combining support for affected student-athletes with a focus on accountability and prevention of academic fraud, we can demonstrate a commitment to ethical practices and integrity within the university community. This multifaceted approach will not only address the immediate needs of those impacted by the fraudulent activities but also work towards rebuilding trust and upholding academic standards at UNC.
