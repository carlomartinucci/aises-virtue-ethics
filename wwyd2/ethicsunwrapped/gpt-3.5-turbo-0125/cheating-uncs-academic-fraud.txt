I would establish a comprehensive academic support program specifically tailored to the student-athletes impacted by the academic fraud at UNC. This program would include individualized academic plans for each student, incorporating tutoring, counseling services, and academic advising to address any educational gaps resulting from the fraudulent practices. Additionally, I would ensure ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the program's effectiveness to track the progress of the students and make necessary adjustments to support their academic growth.

To prevent future incidents of academic fraud, I would implement strict oversight and auditing mechanisms for all coursework, particularly in departments where fraudulent practices were identified. This would involve regular classroom and coursework audits to ensure academic integrity and accountability. I would also establish clear guidelines and protocols for course enrollment, especially for upper-level courses, to prevent unauthorized access and ensure that students are appropriately placed based on their academic qualifications.

Furthermore, I would prioritize transparency and communication within the university community by organizing regular town hall meetings and open forums to address concerns, provide updates on the investigation, and outline the steps being taken to uphold academic integrity. By fostering open dialogue and accountability, we can rebuild trust, promote ethical behavior, and demonstrate the university's commitment to providing a quality education for all students.
