I would propose the following concrete actions to address the issue of unauthorized disclosure of classified information within government agencies:

1. Implement a mandatory annual security training program for all government officials and employees handling sensitive information. This program would include detailed instructions on the proper handling of classified data, the consequences of unauthorized disclosures, and the importance of maintaining confidentiality.

By providing regular and comprehensive training, government personnel will be better equipped to understand and adhere to security protocols, reducing the likelihood of inadvertent leaks.

This action directly addresses the need for specific measures to enhance security awareness and promote a culture of responsibility and integrity among government officials, contributing to the prevention of future unauthorized disclosures.
