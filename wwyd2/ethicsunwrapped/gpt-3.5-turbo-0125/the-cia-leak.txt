To address the issue of classified information leaks within government agencies, I would recommend the following concrete actions:

1. Implement Mandatory Annual Security Training: Require all government employees with access to classified information to undergo annual security training sessions that emphasize the importance of confidentiality and the consequences of leaking sensitive information.

2. Conduct Regular Security Audits: Establish a system for conducting regular security audits within government agencies to assess compliance with security protocols and identify any vulnerabilities that could potentially lead to leaks of classified information.

3. Strengthen Whistleblower Protection Policies: Enhance whistleblower protection policies to encourage individuals to report any suspected leaks of classified information without fear of retaliation, while also ensuring that false accusations are appropriately addressed.

By implementing these specific actions, we can work towards creating a more secure environment within government agencies, fostering a culture of accountability, and reducing the risk of future breaches of classified information.
