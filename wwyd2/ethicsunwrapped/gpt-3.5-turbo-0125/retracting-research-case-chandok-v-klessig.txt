I would initiate an independent investigation led by a panel of research integrity experts to thoroughly examine the concerns raised regarding the replication of the research results and the retraction of the article. This panel would review all available data, documentation, and correspondence related to the study to determine the validity of the findings and assess any potential misconduct.

Additionally, I would engage in a mediation process involving both Meena Chandok and Daniel Klessig to facilitate a constructive dialogue and address the issues at hand. This mediation would aim to clarify misunderstandings, establish accountability, and seek a resolution that upholds the integrity of the research process and respects the reputations of all parties involved.

Furthermore, I would establish clear protocols and guidelines for handling research discrepancies and conflicts within the institution to prevent similar situations in the future. These protocols would outline steps for addressing concerns, conducting investigations, and communicating findings transparently to uphold research integrity and ethical standards.

By taking these specific actions, we can ensure a fair and thorough examination of the situation, promote open communication and accountability, and implement preventive measures to uphold ethical standards in scientific research.
