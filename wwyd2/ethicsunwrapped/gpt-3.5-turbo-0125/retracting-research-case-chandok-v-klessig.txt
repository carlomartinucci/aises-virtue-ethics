I would recommend convening an independent panel of experts in scientific research ethics to conduct a thorough review of the case involving Meena Chandok and Daniel Klessig. This panel would be tasked with examining the original research data, the replication attempts, and the findings of the institutional investigation to determine the scientific validity of the published results and the allegations of misconduct.

The panel should consist of individuals with expertise in plant cell biology, research integrity, and publication ethics, who are not affiliated with either party involved in the dispute. They would be responsible for evaluating the methodology, data analysis, and conclusions of the original study, as well as the subsequent replication attempts and the institutional investigation findings.

Based on the panel's findings, recommendations could be made regarding the retraction of the article, potential disciplinary actions, and steps to address any damage to Meena Chandok's career and reputation. This approach would ensure a thorough and impartial assessment of the scientific and ethical issues at hand, while also upholding the standards of integrity and accountability in scientific research.
