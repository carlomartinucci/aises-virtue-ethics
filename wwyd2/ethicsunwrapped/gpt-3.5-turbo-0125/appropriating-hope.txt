To address the ethical considerations raised in the critique, I would take the following specific action in the context of artistic appropriation:

I would conduct thorough research to identify and reach out to the original creator or copyright holder of the image or object I intend to appropriate for my artwork. This research would involve examining the history of the work, tracing ownership rights, and understanding any relevant legal agreements or contracts.

Upon identifying the original creator or copyright holder, I would initiate direct communication to request permission for the use of their work in my artwork. In this communication, I would clearly outline my intentions, discuss potential compensation or credit arrangements, and express a willingness to collaborate if the opportunity arises.

By proactively seeking permission and engaging in transparent communication with the original creator, I aim to uphold ethical standards, respect intellectual property rights, and foster positive relationships within the artistic community. This approach not only demonstrates a commitment to ethical practices but also ensures that my creative endeavors align with legal requirements and ethical considerations.
