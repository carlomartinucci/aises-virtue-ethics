If I were in a similar situation, I would first reach out directly to the original creator of the image I intend to appropriate, in this case, Mannie Garcia, the photographer of the Associated Press (A.P.) photo. I would express my admiration for the photograph and my interest in using it as a reference for my artwork. I would request a meeting or a call to discuss the possibility of obtaining permission to use the image, ensuring transparency and respect for Garcia's rights.

If Garcia grants permission, I would negotiate the terms of use, including giving proper credit in my artwork and potentially discussing compensation based on mutual agreement. I would document our discussions and formalize the agreement in writing to ensure clarity and accountability.

However, if Garcia denies permission or sets conditions that I cannot meet, I would respect his decision and seek alternative sources of inspiration for my artwork. It is crucial to prioritize ethical behavior and uphold the rights of the original creator, even if it means adjusting my artistic vision.

Throughout the process, I would consult with intellectual property lawyers to ensure that I am compliant with copyright laws and fair use principles. Legal guidance is essential in navigating the complexities of artistic appropriation while maintaining ethical standards and integrity in my creative practice.
