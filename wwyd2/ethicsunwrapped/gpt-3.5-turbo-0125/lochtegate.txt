In response to the situation involving Ryan Lochte's behavior in Rio de Janeiro, I would recommend the following specific action:

Ryan Lochte should issue a public apology directly to the Brazilian authorities, the people of Brazil, and the Olympic community. This apology should be sincere, acknowledging the harm caused by his actions and expressing genuine remorse for the negative impact on the host country and the reputation of the Olympic Games. Lochte should take full responsibility for his behavior and the consequences that followed, demonstrating accountability and a commitment to making amends.
