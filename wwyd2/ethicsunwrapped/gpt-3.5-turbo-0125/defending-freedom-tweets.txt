In addition to recommending a detailed public apology, I would advise Mendenhall to actively engage in constructive dialogue with his critics and stakeholders. This could involve reaching out to individuals who expressed concerns about his tweets, listening to their perspectives, and engaging in respectful discussions to clarify his views and intentions. By demonstrating a willingness to understand differing opinions and engaging in open communication, Mendenhall can show his commitment to promoting respectful dialogue and learning from the situation. This proactive approach can help rebuild trust with his audience and stakeholders, fostering a more positive and constructive outcome from the controversy.
