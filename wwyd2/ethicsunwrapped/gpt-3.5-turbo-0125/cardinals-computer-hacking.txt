In response to the scenario involving Chris Correa's unethical actions, I would take the following specific action within the organization:

1. Implement a zero-tolerance policy for unethical behavior and data breaches, clearly outlining the consequences for such actions. This policy would include immediate termination for any employee found guilty of unauthorized access to confidential information or engaging in criminal activities like hacking. By clearly communicating and enforcing this policy, we send a strong message that unethical behavior will not be tolerated within the organization, promoting a culture of integrity and accountability.
