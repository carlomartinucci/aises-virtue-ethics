To address potential challenges in implementing the proposed actions, I would prioritize building a strong business case to demonstrate the long-term benefits of investing in employee welfare. This would involve conducting a cost-benefit analysis to show how improvements in wages, benefits, and employee satisfaction can lead to reduced turnover costs, increased productivity, and enhanced customer satisfaction.

Additionally, I would engage with key stakeholders, including senior management, shareholders, and employees, to communicate the rationale behind the proposed changes and garner their support. This would involve highlighting the positive impact on the company's reputation, brand loyalty, and overall success by prioritizing ethical business practices and employee well-being.

Furthermore, I would create a phased implementation plan that outlines specific timelines, responsibilities, and milestones for each action. By breaking down the process into manageable steps and setting clear objectives, we can track progress, address any challenges that arise, and ensure alignment with the company's strategic goals.

Overall, by focusing on building a compelling business case, engaging stakeholders, and implementing a structured plan, we can overcome potential obstacles and drive meaningful change towards a more ethically sound and sustainable business model.
