One specific action I would take to improve employee treatment and success within the company is to implement a mentorship program for employees at all levels. This program would pair experienced employees with newer hires to provide guidance, support, and opportunities for professional growth. By fostering a culture of mentorship, employees can benefit from shared knowledge, skill development, and career advancement opportunities. This initiative would not only enhance employee satisfaction and retention but also contribute to a more collaborative and supportive work environment at Costco.
