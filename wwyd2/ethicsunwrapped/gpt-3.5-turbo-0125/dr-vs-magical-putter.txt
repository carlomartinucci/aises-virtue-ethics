One specific action I would take in response to the scenario is to implement a thorough editorial review process for sensitive stories, particularly those involving marginalized communities. This process would involve creating a designated review committee consisting of diverse staff members, including individuals from the transgender community or experts in LGBTQ+ issues.

The review committee would be responsible for assessing the ethical implications of stories, especially when it comes to issues of privacy, consent, and potential harm to individuals. They would provide feedback on the framing, language, and overall approach of the story to ensure that it is respectful, accurate, and does not perpetuate harmful stereotypes or stigmas.

By incorporating a diverse range of perspectives in the editorial review process, Grantland can better navigate complex ethical considerations and avoid unintentional harm or insensitivity in their reporting. This proactive approach can help prevent similar ethical lapses in the future and promote a culture of responsible journalism within the organization.
