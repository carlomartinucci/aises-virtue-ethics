One specific action I would take in response to the Wells Fargo scandal is to conduct a thorough review and overhaul of the bank's incentive structures. This would involve revising the sales targets and performance metrics to ensure they align with ethical standards and do not incentivize employees to engage in fraudulent activities.

By reevaluating the incentive system, we can shift the focus from quantity-based targets, such as the number of accounts opened, to quality-based metrics that prioritize customer satisfaction, ethical behavior, and compliance with regulations. This would help create a culture where employees are encouraged to act in the best interests of customers rather than solely focusing on meeting sales goals at any cost.

Additionally, I would implement regular ethics training programs for all employees to reinforce the importance of integrity, transparency, and ethical decision-making in their day-to-day roles. These training sessions would provide practical guidance on identifying and reporting unethical behavior, as well as empower employees to speak up when they witness misconduct.

Furthermore, I would establish a dedicated ethics committee within the organization to oversee compliance with ethical standards, conduct regular audits, and investigate any reported violations. This committee would serve as an independent body to ensure accountability and transparency in addressing ethical concerns within the bank.

Overall, by restructuring the incentive system, providing ongoing ethics training, and establishing an ethics committee, we can create a more ethical and responsible organizational culture at Wells Fargo, fostering trust among employees, customers, and stakeholders.
