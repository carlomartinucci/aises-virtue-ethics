One specific action to address the Wells Fargo scandal would be to establish a comprehensive ethics and compliance training program for all employees. This program should focus on educating staff about ethical conduct, regulatory compliance, and the importance of integrity in all aspects of their work. The training should be mandatory for all employees, including senior management, and should be conducted regularly to reinforce ethical principles and ensure understanding.

By implementing a robust ethics and compliance training program, Wells Fargo can instill a culture of integrity and accountability throughout the organization. Employees will be better equipped to identify and report unethical behavior, understand the consequences of non-compliance, and make ethical decisions in their day-to-day roles. This proactive approach can help prevent future misconduct, rebuild trust with stakeholders, and demonstrate a commitment to upholding ethical standards within the company.
