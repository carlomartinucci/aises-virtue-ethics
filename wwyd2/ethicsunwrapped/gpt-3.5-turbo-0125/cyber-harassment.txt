I would schedule a private meeting with the teacher, Idalia Hern√°ndez Ramos, to discuss the cyber harassment incident and address the concerns raised about the public posting of the video. During the meeting, I would emphasize the importance of respecting the privacy and rights of all individuals involved. I would provide guidance on handling similar situations in a more confidential manner in the future to protect the dignity of students while addressing inappropriate behavior.

Additionally, I would offer counseling services to the student who posted the hurtful messages to address any underlying issues that may have contributed to her behavior. This support would aim to help the student understand the impact of her actions and promote positive online behavior moving forward.

To prevent future incidents, I would work with school administrators to review and strengthen policies and guidelines related to cyberbullying and social media use. This may include implementing educational programs on digital citizenship and online etiquette for students and staff to raise awareness about the consequences of cyberbullying and promote a culture of respect and empathy online.

Overall, my actions would focus on addressing the specific concerns raised in the scenario, such as privacy rights and preventive measures, to ensure a more ethically sound and practical response to the cyber harassment incident.
