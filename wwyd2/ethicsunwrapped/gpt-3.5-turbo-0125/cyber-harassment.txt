To address the cyber harassment incident involving the teacher, Idalia Hern√°ndez Ramos, and the student who posted hurtful messages, I would take the following specific action:

1. Implement a Cyber Etiquette Workshop: I would organize a workshop on cyber etiquette and responsible online behavior for students at the school. This workshop would educate students on the potential consequences of cyberbullying and the importance of respectful communication online. It would also provide guidance on how to handle conflicts or negative emotions in a constructive manner.

By proactively addressing the issue through education and awareness, this workshop aims to prevent future incidents of cyber harassment and promote a culture of empathy and respect among students. It also serves as a proactive measure to empower students with the knowledge and skills to navigate online interactions responsibly.
