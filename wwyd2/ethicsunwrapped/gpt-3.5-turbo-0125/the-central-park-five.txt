I would work with legal advocacy organizations to push for the implementation of a mandatory review process for cases involving potential wrongful convictions. This process would involve an independent panel of legal experts and forensic specialists who would assess the evidence, including confessions, to ensure that it aligns with physical evidence and is not coerced. By establishing this review process, we can help prevent future miscarriages of justice and provide a mechanism for accountability in cases where wrongful convictions occur.
