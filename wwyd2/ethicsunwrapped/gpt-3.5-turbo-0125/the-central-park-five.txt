I would work on advocating for the implementation of legislation that mandates the recording of all police interrogations in order to prevent coerced confessions and ensure transparency in the criminal justice system. By requiring the recording of interrogations, we can create a clear record of the interactions between law enforcement and suspects, which can help prevent wrongful convictions based on false confessions. This measure would provide a safeguard against coercion and misconduct during the interrogation process, ultimately leading to fairer trials and increased accountability within the system.
