To address the concerns raised in the critique, I would implement a mandatory training program for all journalists and editorial staff on responsible reporting practices when covering sensitive topics like suicide. This training would include:

1. **Case Studies and Workshops:** Organize interactive workshops where journalists can engage in discussions and analyze case studies related to reporting on suicide. This hands-on approach will help them understand the ethical dilemmas involved and how to navigate them effectively.

By providing concrete examples and practical insights, journalists can develop a deeper understanding of the impact of their reporting on vulnerable individuals and the importance of respecting privacy and dignity in such cases.
