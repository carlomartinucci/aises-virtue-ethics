I would establish a clear protocol within the news organization for reporting on sensitive topics like suicide. This protocol would include guidelines on avoiding excessive detail about suicide methods, as well as specific examples of best practices in reporting on such topics. I would organize a mandatory training session for all journalists and staff involved in covering sensitive issues, focusing on responsible reporting practices and ethical considerations. The training would incorporate case studies and simulations to provide practical examples of how to handle such topics sensitively.

Additionally, I would create a review process for all suicide-related news coverage, where a designated team would assess the content to ensure it aligns with the established guidelines and ethical standards. This team would be responsible for approving the publication of any suicide-related stories, providing an extra layer of oversight to uphold responsible reporting practices.

Furthermore, I would collaborate with mental health experts to develop a resource guide that includes helplines and mental health support services to be included in all suicide-related news coverage. This guide would serve as a valuable resource for readers who may be affected by the content and provide them with access to necessary support services.

By implementing these concrete actions, the news organization can demonstrate a commitment to ethical journalism practices when reporting on sensitive topics like suicide, while also ensuring that the privacy and dignity of those affected are respected.
