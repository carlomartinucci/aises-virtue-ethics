I would recommend convening a meeting with the hospital's ethics committee, the patient's treatment team, and the patient's son who is the designated guardian. During this meeting, the team should discuss the ethical implications of administering the new medication by mixing it in the patient's food without his knowledge. The focus should be on balancing the patient's autonomy and well-being with the goal of facilitating his return to the community.

In the meeting, the team should explore alternative options for administering the medication that respect the patient's autonomy while also addressing his paranoid fears. This could involve engaging with the patient to discuss the benefits of the new medication and addressing his concerns about being poisoned. The team should also consider involving a mental health advocate to provide support and guidance in communicating with the patient.

Furthermore, the team should review the legal aspects of the situation to ensure that all decisions are in compliance with relevant laws and regulations regarding the treatment of mentally incompetent individuals. This may involve consulting with a legal expert to clarify the rights and responsibilities of the patient's guardian in making medical decisions on his behalf.

By taking these specific actions, the team can navigate the ethical complexities of the situation while prioritizing the patient's well-being and autonomy.
