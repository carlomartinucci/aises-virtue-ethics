To address the ethical dilemma presented in the scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Engage a Mental Health Counselor**: I would involve a mental health counselor to work directly with the patient to address his paranoid symptoms and fears of being poisoned. The counselor would focus on building trust with the patient and helping him understand the necessity and benefits of the new medication.

2. **Explore Alternative Administration Methods**: I would collaborate with the medical team to explore alternative methods of administering the medication that are more acceptable to the patient. This could involve considering different forms of the drug or adjusting the dosage schedule to accommodate the patient's concerns.

3. **Conduct a Family Meeting**: I would organize a meeting with the patient's son, the medical team, and a bioethicist to discuss the ethical implications of covert medication administration. During this meeting, we would address the potential long-term consequences of deception on the patient's trust and well-being.

4. **Develop a Trust-Building Plan**: Together with the mental health counselor, we would create a trust-building plan that focuses on open communication and transparency with the patient. This plan would aim to gradually involve the patient in decision-making regarding his treatment to empower him and reduce feelings of deception.

By implementing these specific actions, we can work towards a more ethically sound and practical resolution to the dilemma, prioritizing the patient's well-being while respecting his autonomy and addressing the concerns raised in the initial critique.
