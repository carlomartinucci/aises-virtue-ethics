I would recommend that Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams take concrete steps to rectify the situation with the Gaye estate. They should offer a percentage of future royalties from "Blurred Lines" to the Gaye estate as a form of compensation for the similarities between the songs. This gesture would demonstrate their acknowledgment of the influence of Marvin Gaye's music and their commitment to making amends for any unintended infringement.

Additionally, Thicke and Williams could collaborate with the Gaye estate on future projects to honor Marvin Gaye's musical legacy and promote a culture of mutual respect among artists. By working together on initiatives that raise awareness about copyright issues in the music industry and advocate for ethical practices in music creation, they can show their dedication to upholding the integrity of artistic inspiration while respecting the rights of original creators.
