I would initiate a comprehensive review of the PRWORA's impact on low-income families by conducting in-depth interviews with welfare recipients to understand their experiences and challenges firsthand. This direct engagement would provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the policy and help identify areas for improvement.

Additionally, I would collaborate with social workers and advocacy groups to assess the practical implications of the work requirements and time limits imposed by the PRWORA. By working closely with these stakeholders, I can gain diverse perspectives and expertise to inform potential policy adjustments that better support the economic stability and well-being of low-income individuals.

Furthermore, I would analyze data on welfare caseloads, employment rates, and poverty levels to evaluate the outcomes of the welfare reform. This data-driven approach would enable me to identify trends, disparities, and areas where the policy may have fallen short in achieving its intended goals. Based on this analysis, I would develop evidence-based recommendations for policy changes that address the challenges faced by low-income families and individuals.

By combining direct engagement with affected individuals, collaboration with stakeholders, and data analysis, I aim to develop practical solutions that improve the welfare system and better support those in need.
