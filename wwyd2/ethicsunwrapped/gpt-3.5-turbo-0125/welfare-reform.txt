To further enhance the approach to addressing the ethical considerations surrounding the impact of the PRWORA on low-income families and individuals, I would implement the following specific actions:

1. **Policy Impact Assessment**: Conduct a comprehensive policy impact assessment that includes quantitative data analysis and qualitative feedback from welfare recipients. This assessment would evaluate the effectiveness of the PRWORA in achieving its intended goals, as well as its unintended consequences on vulnerable populations. By analyzing data on employment rates, poverty levels, and social outcomes post-PRWORA implementation, we can identify areas where the policy fell short and where improvements are needed.

By focusing on concrete actions such as conducting a policy impact assessment, we can gather empirical evidence to inform evidence-based policy recommendations and advocate for changes that prioritize the well-being and dignity of low-income families and individuals affected by welfare reform.
