To address the controversy surrounding James Frey's book A Million Little Pieces, as the publisher Doubleday, I would focus on the following specific action:

1. Legal Review and Accountability: I would immediately engage legal counsel to assess any potential legal implications resulting from the misrepresentation in marketing the book as a memoir. This review would include evaluating any contractual obligations with the author, James Frey, and exploring options for recourse if any contractual terms were breached. Additionally, I would hold internal discussions to determine accountability within the publishing process and take appropriate disciplinary actions if necessary.

By prioritizing a legal review and accountability process, Doubleday can demonstrate a commitment to addressing the ethical concerns raised by the controversy in a practical and concrete manner. This action aims to ensure transparency, uphold ethical standards, and mitigate any legal risks associated with the situation.
