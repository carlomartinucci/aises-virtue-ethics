One specific action I would take in response to the scenario is to establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission specifically focused on addressing the doping scandal in East Germany. This commission would be tasked with investigating the individuals and institutions responsible for implementing and perpetuating the doping program. By uncovering the truth behind the scandal and holding those accountable for their actions, the commission can provide a sense of justice for the affected athletes and help prevent similar abuses in the future. Additionally, the commission could recommend reforms and regulations to ensure greater transparency and oversight in sports organizations to prevent unethical practices.
