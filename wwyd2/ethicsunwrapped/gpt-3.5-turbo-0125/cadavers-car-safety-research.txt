I would immediately halt any ongoing research involving human cadavers in car crash tests at Heidelberg University and Wayne State University. I would assemble an independent ethics committee comprising experts in bioethics, law, and medical research to conduct a thorough investigation into the research practices and consent procedures used in these studies. The committee would review all documentation related to the acquisition of cadavers, consent forms from families, and the necessity of using human subjects over alternative methods like advanced crash test dummies.

Furthermore, I would ensure that all families of the deceased individuals involved in the research are contacted and provided with detailed information about the studies their loved ones were part of. This would include transparent communication about the purpose of the research, how their consent was obtained, and the potential impact of the findings on automotive safety.

Based on the committee's findings, I would establish clear and stringent ethical guidelines for any future research involving human subjects. These guidelines would prioritize respect for human dignity, informed consent, and the pursuit of knowledge that cannot be obtained through other means. Additionally, I would implement regular audits and oversight mechanisms to ensure compliance with these ethical standards in all research activities conducted at the universities.
