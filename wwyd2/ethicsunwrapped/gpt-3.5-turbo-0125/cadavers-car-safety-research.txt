I would take the following specific actions to address the ethical concerns raised in the scenario:

1. **Establish a Task Force for Ethical Oversight**: I would create a task force comprising experts in bioethics, law, and medical ethics to conduct a thorough review of the research conducted at Heidelberg University and Wayne State University using human cadavers in car crash tests. This task force would be responsible for evaluating the research protocols, consent procedures, and the necessity of using human cadavers over alternative methods.

2. **Develop Ethical Guidelines and Regulations**: Based on the findings of the task force, I would work with the relevant authorities to develop specific ethical guidelines and regulations for research involving human cadavers in car crash tests. These guidelines would outline the requirements for obtaining informed consent from families, ensuring the dignity of the deceased, and monitoring the impact of the research on car safety advancements.

3. **Implement Oversight Mechanisms**: I would establish oversight mechanisms to ensure compliance with the ethical guidelines and regulations. This could involve regular audits of research practices, monitoring of consent procedures, and reporting requirements for researchers conducting studies using human cadavers.

By taking these concrete actions, we can address the ethical concerns raised by various stakeholders, promote transparency and accountability in research practices, and ensure that future studies involving human cadavers in car crash tests are conducted in an ethically sound manner.
