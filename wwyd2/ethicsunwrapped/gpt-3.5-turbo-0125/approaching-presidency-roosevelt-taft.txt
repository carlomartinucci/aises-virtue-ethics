I would recommend President Theodore Roosevelt to establish a bipartisan advisory council composed of legal experts, scholars, and representatives from both major political parties. This council would serve as a forum for discussing the legal and ethical implications of proposed executive actions. By fostering dialogue and seeking diverse perspectives, President Roosevelt can ensure that his decisions are thoroughly vetted from various angles.

Furthermore, I would advise President Roosevelt to implement a system of periodic reviews of his executive orders and policy decisions by an independent ethics committee. This committee would evaluate the ethical considerations of each action, considering factors such as transparency, accountability, and public interest. By subjecting his decisions to ethical scrutiny, President Roosevelt can demonstrate a commitment to upholding high ethical standards in governance.

In addition, I would suggest that President Roosevelt prioritize transparency in his decision-making process by regularly communicating with the public about the rationale behind his actions and the ethical principles guiding his governance. By fostering an open dialogue with the American people, President Roosevelt can build trust and credibility, demonstrating his commitment to ethical leadership.

Overall, by engaging with a diverse advisory council, establishing an ethics committee, and prioritizing transparency, President Roosevelt can navigate the complexities of governance while upholding ethical standards and promoting public trust in his leadership.
