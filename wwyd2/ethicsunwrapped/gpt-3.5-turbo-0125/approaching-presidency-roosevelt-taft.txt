I would recommend that President Roosevelt establish an independent advisory committee composed of legal experts, constitutional scholars, and ethicists to review and provide guidance on any proposed actions that may push the boundaries of executive power. This committee would be tasked with conducting thorough assessments of the legal and ethical implications of the president's decisions, ensuring that they align with constitutional principles and ethical standards.

Additionally, I would advise President Roosevelt to engage in open dialogue with Congress and relevant stakeholders to communicate the rationale behind his actions and seek input on potential concerns or objections. By fostering transparency and collaboration, President Roosevelt can demonstrate a commitment to upholding the rule of law while also considering diverse perspectives in decision-making processes.

Furthermore, I would suggest that President Roosevelt prioritize the establishment of clear guidelines and protocols for evaluating the legality and ethicality of his actions, incorporating feedback from the advisory committee and other stakeholders. By institutionalizing a framework for ethical decision-making within the executive branch, President Roosevelt can promote accountability and integrity in his governance practices.

Overall, by proactively seeking expert advice, engaging in transparent communication, and institutionalizing ethical decision-making processes, President Roosevelt can navigate the complexities of executive power in a manner that upholds legal boundaries and ethical standards.
