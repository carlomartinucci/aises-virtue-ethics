I would collaborate with external experts or consultants specializing in diversity and inclusion to provide additional insights and guidance in developing and implementing initiatives to address racial discrimination on campus. These experts could offer valuable perspectives and best practices to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed actions. Their involvement would ensure that the university is following ethical and practical approaches in creating a more inclusive and respectful environment for all students.
