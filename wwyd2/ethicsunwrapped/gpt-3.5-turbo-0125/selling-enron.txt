To address the unethical practices at Enron, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Report to Regulatory Authorities: I would immediately report the fraudulent activities observed within Enron to the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Providing detailed information about the schemes and individuals involved is crucial for initiating investigations and holding accountable those responsible for the misconduct.

By taking this step, I aim to ensure that the regulatory bodies are aware of the unethical practices at Enron and can take necessary actions to protect consumers and maintain the integrity of the energy markets. Reporting to authorities is a concrete action that can help prevent further harm and contribute to the enforcement of ethical standards within the industry.
