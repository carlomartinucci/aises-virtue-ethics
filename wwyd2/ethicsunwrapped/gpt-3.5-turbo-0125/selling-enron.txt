I would first gather all the evidence and documentation related to Enron's fraudulent activities within the company. I would then approach the internal compliance or ethics department, if available, to report these findings and request an investigation into the matter. I would emphasize the urgency and seriousness of the situation to ensure prompt action is taken.

Simultaneously, I would reach out to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to report Enron's fraudulent practices and provide them with the evidence I have collected. I would cooperate fully with any investigations and be prepared to testify if required to ensure that justice is served and those responsible are held accountable.

Encouraging other employees who are aware of these practices to come forward and provide their testimony would also be crucial in building a strong case against Enron. By taking these steps, I aim to address the unethical behavior internally, seek justice through external authorities, and prevent further harm to customers and stakeholders affected by Enron's fraudulent actions.
