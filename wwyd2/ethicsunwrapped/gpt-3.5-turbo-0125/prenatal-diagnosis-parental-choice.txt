I would initiate a collaborative effort involving medical professionals specializing in genetic disorders, advocacy groups representing individuals with Down syndrome, and legal experts to develop guidelines for healthcare providers on counseling pregnant individuals following a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. These guidelines would emphasize providing comprehensive information on the condition, available support services, and options for care, including adoption and parenting.

Additionally, I would establish a task force comprising representatives from pro-life and pro-choice organizations, ethicists, and individuals with lived experience of Down syndrome to facilitate dialogue and consensus-building on the issue of prenatal testing bans. This task force would work towards developing a framework that respects the autonomy of pregnant individuals while also recognizing the rights and dignity of individuals with disabilities.

Furthermore, I would advocate for the implementation of comprehensive prenatal care programs that prioritize early detection and intervention for genetic abnormalities, including Down syndrome. These programs would aim to provide holistic support to pregnant individuals and families, addressing their emotional, social, and medical needs throughout the pregnancy and beyond.

By taking these concrete steps, we can promote informed decision-making, foster dialogue among stakeholders with diverse perspectives, and ensure that policies and practices related to prenatal testing and abortion uphold ethical principles of respect, compassion, and justice for all individuals involved.
