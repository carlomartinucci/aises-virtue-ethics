To address the root causes of why individuals succumb to peer pressure and make unethical choices, one specific action that can be taken is to implement mandatory ethical training and discussions within the group. By incorporating regular sessions focused on moral decision-making, ethical reasoning, and the consequences of unethical behavior, individuals can develop a deeper understanding of the importance of ethical conduct and the impact of their actions on others.

During these training sessions, real-life case studies and scenarios, such as the historical example of Reserve Police Battalion 101, can be analyzed to highlight the dangers of conformity and blind obedience to authority. By engaging in discussions and role-playing exercises, group members can practice identifying ethical dilemmas, evaluating different courses of action, and building the confidence to speak up against wrongdoing.

Furthermore, leaders within the group can set a positive example by openly discussing their own ethical considerations and decision-making processes. By demonstrating a commitment to ethical behavior and encouraging open dialogue, leaders can create a culture that values integrity, critical thinking, and moral courage.

Overall, by incorporating mandatory ethical training and discussions within the group, individuals can develop the skills and awareness needed to resist peer pressure, make principled decisions, and uphold ethical standards in challenging situations.
