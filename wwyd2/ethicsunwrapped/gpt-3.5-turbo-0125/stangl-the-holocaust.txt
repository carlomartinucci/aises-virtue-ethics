One specific action that can be taken to prevent similar atrocities is to advocate for and support the implementation of international laws and mechanisms that hold individuals accountable for crimes against humanity. This can involve actively participating in campaigns, signing petitions, and supporting organizations that work towards strengthening international justice systems. By advocating for legal frameworks that ensure perpetrators of mass atrocities are brought to justice, we can help deter future atrocities and promote a more just and humane world.
