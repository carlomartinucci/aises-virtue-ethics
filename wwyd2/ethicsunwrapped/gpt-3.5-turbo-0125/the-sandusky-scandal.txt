I would immediately contact the local police department and child protective services to report the allegations of sexual abuse by Jerry Sandusky as disclosed by graduate assistant coach Mike McQueary. It is crucial to ensure that a thorough investigation is conducted to protect the victim and hold the perpetrator accountable for their actions. Additionally, I would reach out to the victim to offer support and connect them with counseling services to address any trauma they may have experienced. Furthermore, I would recommend implementing mandatory reporting policies within the institution to prevent similar incidents from being overlooked in the future.
