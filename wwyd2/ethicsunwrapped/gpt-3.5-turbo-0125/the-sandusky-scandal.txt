I would immediately contact the police and child protective services to report the information provided by graduate assistant coach Mike McQueary regarding the sexual abuse allegations against Jerry Sandusky. It is crucial to ensure that a thorough investigation is conducted to protect the victim and hold the perpetrator accountable for their actions. Additionally, I would work with relevant authorities to provide support and resources to the victim to address any trauma they may have experienced. Furthermore, I would advocate for policy changes within the organization to establish clear reporting protocols for incidents of abuse and to prioritize the safety and well-being of individuals, especially vulnerable populations.
