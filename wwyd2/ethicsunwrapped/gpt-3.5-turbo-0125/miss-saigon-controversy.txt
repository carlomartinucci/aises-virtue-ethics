To address the ethical concerns raised regarding the casting of Jonathan Pryce in the role of the Eurasian character in Miss Saigon, I would take the following specific action:

1. Implement a Diversity and Inclusion Policy: I would work with the production team to establish a formal diversity and inclusion policy that outlines clear guidelines for casting decisions. This policy would prioritize authentic representation and opportunities for underrepresented groups, including Asian actors.

By embedding these principles into the core values of the production company, we can ensure that diversity and inclusion are consistently considered in all casting decisions, rather than as a reactive measure. This proactive approach will demonstrate a commitment to ethical casting practices and help prevent future controversies related to representation in the performing arts.
