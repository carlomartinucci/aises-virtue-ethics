To address the ethical concerns surrounding the casting of the Eurasian character in Miss Saigon, I would take the following concrete steps:

1. Initiate a public statement acknowledging the valid concerns raised by the Asian American community regarding representation in the production. Express a commitment to fostering diversity and inclusivity in casting decisions moving forward.

2. Engage in direct dialogue with Asian American theater advocacy groups and community leaders to better understand the impact of casting decisions on underrepresented communities. Seek their input on how to address the historical context of "yellow-face" performances and create more equitable opportunities for Asian American actors.

3. Implement a proactive casting policy that prioritizes authenticity and representation by actively seeking out and auditioning Asian actors for key roles in the production. This includes hosting targeted auditions, collaborating with Asian American talent agencies, and providing support and resources to ensure a level playing field for all actors.

By openly acknowledging the concerns, engaging with the Asian American community, and implementing concrete steps to promote diversity and representation in casting, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and ethically sound production of Miss Saigon.
