In the scenario described, if I were in Egil "Bud" Krogh's position during the meeting where the illegal break-in at Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office was proposed and approved, I would have immediately raised objections to the plan. I would have emphasized the importance of adhering to legal and ethical standards by suggesting alternative approaches to address the leak of sensitive information.

Specifically, I would propose conducting a thorough review of the legal options available, such as seeking a warrant through proper channels or consulting with legal experts to explore lawful means of obtaining relevant information. I would also recommend engaging in open dialogue with the team to discuss the ethical implications of the proposed action and the potential consequences of engaging in illegal activities.

Furthermore, I would document my objections in writing, clearly outlining the reasons for my concerns and advocating for a more ethical and legal course of action. By documenting my stance, I would ensure that there is a record of my commitment to upholding ethical standards and complying with the law, even in high-pressure situations.

Overall, by actively raising objections, proposing legal alternatives, and documenting concerns, I would strive to uphold ethical principles and promote integrity in decision-making processes, ultimately working towards a more ethical and legally compliant resolution to the situation at hand.
