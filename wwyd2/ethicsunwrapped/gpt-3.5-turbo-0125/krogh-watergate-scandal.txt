In the scenario described, if I were in Egil "Bud" Krogh's position during the meeting where the illegal break-in at Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office was proposed and approved, I would have immediately raised objections to the proposed course of action. I would have suggested exploring legal avenues, such as seeking a court order, to obtain the necessary information in a lawful and ethical manner. If the proposed action remained illegal and unethical, I would have refused to participate and reported the matter to appropriate authorities or superiors. Additionally, I would have documented my objections in writing and escalated the issue through proper channels to ensure accountability and transparency in addressing the situation.
