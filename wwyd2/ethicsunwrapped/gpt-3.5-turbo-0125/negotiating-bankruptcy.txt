To address the lack of disclosure regarding the connections between Milbank Tweed, South Street, and Salovaara in the bankruptcy proceedings for Bucyrus-Erie (BE), I would take the following specific actions:

1. Immediately notify the bankruptcy judge about the oversight: I would draft a formal disclosure statement outlining the relationships between Milbank Tweed, South Street, and Salovaara that were not previously disclosed. I would submit this statement to the bankruptcy judge to rectify the lack of transparency and ensure that all relevant parties are aware of the potential conflict of interest.

By taking this proactive step, I would demonstrate accountability for the oversight and work towards mitigating any negative consequences that may arise from the lack of disclosure. This action would align with ethical standards and professional responsibility in the legal profession.
