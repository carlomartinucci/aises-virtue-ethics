I would immediately disclose to the bankruptcy judge the connections between Milbank Tweed, South Street, and Salovaara that were not initially disclosed in the filing documents. This disclosure would include a detailed explanation of the relationships and potential conflicts of interest. Additionally, I would work with the firm's ethics committee to review and amend the initial filing documents to ensure full transparency moving forward. By taking these steps, I aim to address the oversight, uphold ethical standards, and mitigate any potential harm caused by the lack of disclosure to the court and other parties involved in the bankruptcy proceedings.
