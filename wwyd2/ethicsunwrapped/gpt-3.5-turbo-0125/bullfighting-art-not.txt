I would propose the establishment of a pilot program in bullfighting arenas that introduces alternative forms of entertainment that do not involve harm to animals. This program could include cultural performances, exhibitions, and educational events that celebrate Spanish heritage and traditions without the need for bullfighting. By offering diverse and engaging activities, we can provide audiences with entertainment options that align with modern ethical standards and respect for animal welfare. This initiative aims to gradually shift public perception and support towards cruelty-free forms of cultural expression while preserving the cultural significance of the arena. Additionally, I would collaborate with local artists, cultural organizations, and community leaders to design and implement this program, ensuring its success and sustainability in the long term.
