To address the ethical concerns surrounding bullfighting, I would first establish a task force comprised of animal welfare experts, veterinarians, cultural historians, and representatives from bullfighting associations. This task force would be responsible for conducting a thorough assessment of current bullfighting practices, focusing on the treatment and welfare of the bulls involved.

One specific action I would take is to implement unannounced inspections of bull breeding facilities to ensure compliance with animal welfare standards. These inspections would be conducted regularly by a team of independent veterinarians and animal welfare experts to assess the living conditions and treatment of the bulls. Any facility found to be in violation of welfare standards would be subject to immediate corrective action and potential penalties.

Furthermore, I would propose the development of a certification program for bullfighting events that meet stringent animal welfare criteria. This program would require bullfighting arenas to adhere to specific guidelines aimed at minimizing the suffering of the bulls and ensuring their well-being throughout the event. Only events that meet these criteria would be granted certification, providing consumers with a transparent way to support ethical bullfighting practices.

By taking these specific actions, I aim to improve the ethical standards of bullfighting while preserving its cultural significance. The establishment of a task force, implementation of unannounced inspections, and development of a certification program are concrete steps that can lead to tangible improvements in the treatment of bulls involved in bullfighting events.
