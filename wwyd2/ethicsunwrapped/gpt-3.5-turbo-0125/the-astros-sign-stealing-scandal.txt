To address the sign-stealing scandal within the organization, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Internal Investigation:** I would appoint an independent investigative team comprising legal experts, former players, and ethics professionals to thoroughly examine the extent of the sign-stealing scheme within the organization. This team would have full access to all relevant information and individuals involved.

2. **Disciplinary Actions:** Based on the findings of the investigation, I would take swift and decisive disciplinary actions against all individuals found to be complicit in the cheating scandal. This could include suspensions without pay, fines, or termination of contracts, depending on the level of involvement and impact on the integrity of the game.

3. **Policy Implementation:** I would establish and enforce a zero-tolerance policy for any form of cheating or unethical behavior within the organization. This policy would include mandatory ethics training for all players, coaches, and staff, regular audits to ensure compliance, and a confidential reporting system for any suspicions of misconduct.

4. **Public Apology and Restitution:** I would issue a public apology on behalf of the organization to fans, players, and other teams affected by the scandal. Additionally, I would work with MLB to determine appropriate restitution measures, such as community service initiatives, donations to youth baseball programs, or participation in league-wide integrity campaigns.

5. **Rebuilding Trust:** I would engage in transparent communication with fans, sponsors, and the baseball community to demonstrate a commitment to upholding the values of fair play and sportsmanship. This could involve town hall meetings, open forums with players and management, and ongoing updates on the organization's efforts to prevent future misconduct.

By taking these specific actions, the organization can show a genuine dedication to accountability, transparency, and ethical conduct in response to the sign-stealing scandal. This approach aims to not only address the immediate consequences of the wrongdoing but also to rebuild trust and integrity within the organization and the broader baseball community.
