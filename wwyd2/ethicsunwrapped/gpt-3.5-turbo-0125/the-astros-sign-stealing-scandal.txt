One specific action I would take in response to the sign-stealing scandal within the organization is to conduct individual interviews with all players, coaches, and staff members who were involved or had knowledge of the cheating scheme. These interviews would be conducted by an independent ethics and compliance officer to ensure impartiality and transparency in gathering information.

During these interviews, each individual would be given the opportunity to provide their account of the events, their level of involvement, and any information they have regarding others' participation. This process would help in identifying the full extent of the wrongdoing, understanding the organizational culture that allowed such behavior to occur, and holding individuals accountable for their actions.

By conducting individual interviews, we can gather detailed and specific information from each person involved, which can help in corroborating accounts, identifying inconsistencies, and determining the appropriate course of action for each individual based on their level of involvement. This approach would demonstrate a commitment to thoroughness, transparency, and accountability in addressing the scandal and rebuilding trust within the organization and the baseball community.
