To address the unethical tin sourcing practices in Apple's supply chain, I would initiate a direct partnership with a reputable third-party auditing firm specializing in labor rights and environmental sustainability. This firm would conduct unannounced audits of the tin mines in Indonesia to assess working conditions, environmental impact, and compliance with ethical standards.

Simultaneously, I would establish a dedicated team within Apple responsible for overseeing the audit process and implementing corrective actions based on the audit findings. This team would work closely with the auditing firm to ensure thorough investigations and timely follow-up on any identified violations.

Furthermore, I would leverage Apple's influence and financial resources to support initiatives aimed at improving the working conditions in the tin mines. This could involve investing in education and training programs for miners, promoting safe mining practices, and collaborating with local authorities to enforce regulations.

By taking these specific actions, Apple can demonstrate a proactive commitment to ethical sourcing practices, transparency, and accountability in its supply chain. This approach not only addresses the immediate concerns raised in the scenario but also contributes to long-term sustainable improvements in the sourcing of critical components like tin.
