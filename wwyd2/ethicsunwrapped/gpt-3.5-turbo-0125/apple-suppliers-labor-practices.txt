I would propose the following concrete actions to address the unethical sourcing practices in Apple's supply chain:

1. Establish a task force consisting of external labor rights organizations, industry experts, and representatives from affected communities to conduct thorough audits of the tin sourcing practices in Indonesia. These audits would include on-site visits to the mines, interviews with workers, and assessments of working conditions to ensure compliance with ethical standards.

2. Develop a set of specific criteria and standards for the audits, focusing on factors such as worker safety, fair wages, and environmental sustainability. These criteria would serve as a benchmark for evaluating the practices of Apple's suppliers and identifying areas for improvement.

3. Implement a transparent and accountable monitoring system that includes regular follow-up audits to track progress and verify the implementation of corrective actions. This system would help ensure sustained improvements in supplier practices and hold Apple accountable for any violations found.

4. Engage with stakeholders, including workers, local communities, and advocacy groups, throughout the auditing and monitoring process. By involving these groups, Apple can gain valuable insights, address concerns, and foster collaboration towards creating a more ethical and sustainable supply chain.

5. Provide training and resources to suppliers to help them meet ethical standards and improve working conditions. This capacity-building approach would empower suppliers to make positive changes and contribute to long-term sustainability in the supply chain.

By taking these specific actions, Apple can demonstrate a commitment to ethical sourcing practices, promote transparency and accountability, and work towards creating a supply chain that upholds the well-being of workers and the environment.
