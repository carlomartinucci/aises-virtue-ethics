I would immediately initiate a comprehensive review of Tyco International's financial records and transactions during Dennis Kozlowski's tenure as CEO. This review would involve hiring an independent forensic accounting firm to meticulously examine all financial documents, including expense reports, invoices, and payment records. The goal is to identify any irregularities, unauthorized transactions, or potential instances of financial misconduct that may have occurred under Kozlowski's leadership.

Simultaneously, I would establish an independent oversight committee comprised of external experts in corporate governance and ethics. This committee would be tasked with conducting a thorough assessment of Tyco's corporate governance policies and procedures, focusing on areas such as executive compensation, internal controls, and board oversight. The committee's findings and recommendations would be presented to the board of directors for immediate action and implementation.

Furthermore, I would work closely with legal counsel to ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements and to assess the potential legal implications of the unauthorized bonuses and financial misconduct. If any wrongdoing is uncovered, appropriate disciplinary actions would be taken, and restitution would be sought to address any financial harm caused to the company.

By taking swift and decisive action to investigate the financial irregularities, strengthen corporate governance practices, and hold individuals accountable for any misconduct, we can demonstrate a commitment to transparency, integrity, and ethical leadership within Tyco International.
