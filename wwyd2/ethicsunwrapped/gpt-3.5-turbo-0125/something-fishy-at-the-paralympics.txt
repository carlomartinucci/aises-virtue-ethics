One concrete action to address cheating in the Paralympics is to establish an independent oversight committee responsible for conducting regular and surprise audits of athlete classifications. This committee would consist of experts in disability assessment and sports medicine who would review athletes' medical records, observe their training sessions, and conduct in-person assessments to ensure that athletes are accurately classified based on their actual disabilities.

By implementing this oversight committee, we can enhance the transparency and integrity of the classification process, deter athletes from misrepresenting their disabilities, and uphold fair competition in the Paralympic Games. Additionally, the committee's findings and recommendations can be shared with the International Paralympic Committee to inform future policy decisions and strengthen the overall governance of the Paralympic movement.
