To address the influx of unaccompanied minors entering the United States from Central America, I would take the following concrete actions:

1. Establish a Multidisciplinary Task Force: I would create a task force comprising representatives from government agencies, human rights organizations, religious institutions, and local communities. This task force would be responsible for coordinating efforts to ensure the safe and humane treatment of migrant children while also addressing border security concerns. The task force would meet regularly to assess the situation, allocate resources effectively, and address any emerging challenges.

By establishing a task force with diverse stakeholders, we can leverage the expertise and resources of different organizations to develop comprehensive and sustainable solutions to the issue of unaccompanied minors at the border.

This specific action addresses the need for a structured and collaborative approach to the problem, as highlighted in the critique of the previous response. It ensures that decision-making is transparent and inclusive, and that efforts are coordinated across various sectors to maximize impact and effectiveness.
