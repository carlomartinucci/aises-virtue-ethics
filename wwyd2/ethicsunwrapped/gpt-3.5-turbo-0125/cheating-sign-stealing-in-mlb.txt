I would compile a detailed report outlining the Astros' sign-stealing scheme, including the individuals involved, the methods used, and the impact on the game. This report would be submitted directly to the MLB commissioner's office for investigation and appropriate action. Additionally, I would recommend implementing regular audits of team communications and technology use during games to detect and prevent future instances of electronic sign-stealing. This proactive approach would help uphold the integrity of the game and ensure fair play among all teams.
