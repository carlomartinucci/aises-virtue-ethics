I would immediately convene a meeting with the team owner, Jim Crane, to present the evidence of the sign-stealing scandal within the Houston Astros organization. During the meeting, I would recommend initiating a comprehensive internal investigation led by an independent third party to identify all individuals involved in the scheme and assess the extent of their participation.

As part of the investigation, I would ensure that all relevant documentation, communication records, and firsthand accounts are thoroughly reviewed. The investigation team would interview players, coaches, and staff members to gather additional information and insights into the sign-stealing activities.

Following the investigation, I would propose implementing stricter monitoring and oversight protocols to prevent future incidents of cheating within the organization. This could involve enhanced training on ethical conduct, increased supervision of in-game activities, and the establishment of a confidential reporting system for any suspected violations.

In terms of disciplinary actions, I would recommend taking swift and decisive measures against those found to be involved in the sign-stealing scheme. This may include issuing public apologies, accepting fines or sanctions, suspending or terminating individuals responsible, and implementing measures to rebuild trust with fans, players, and the baseball community.

Lastly, I would emphasize the importance of transparency and cooperation with MLB investigations, as well as the need to communicate openly with stakeholders about the steps being taken to address the scandal and prevent future misconduct.
