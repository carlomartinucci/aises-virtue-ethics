I would recommend that Justice Scalia recuse himself from the case due to the appearance of bias resulting from his social interactions with Vice President Cheney. By recusing himself, Justice Scalia would uphold the integrity of the judicial process and avoid any perception of impropriety. Additionally, I would advise Justice Scalia to issue a public statement explaining his decision to recuse himself, emphasizing the importance of maintaining public trust in the judiciary and ensuring the fairness of the legal proceedings. This public disclosure would provide transparency and clarity regarding Justice Scalia's ethical considerations and actions in this case.
