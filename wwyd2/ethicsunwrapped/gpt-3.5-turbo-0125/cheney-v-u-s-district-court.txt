I would advise Justice Scalia to recuse himself from the case due to his social interactions with defendant Cheney, which could raise concerns about his impartiality. By recusing himself, Justice Scalia can uphold the integrity of the judicial process and avoid any appearance of bias. Additionally, I would recommend that Justice Scalia publicly acknowledge the potential conflict of interest and explain his decision to recuse himself to maintain transparency and trust in the legal system.
