To address the critique and provide a more practical response to the scenario, I would focus on implementing a specific action to enhance the ethical considerations surrounding social media use by college athletes:

1. Implement Mandatory Social Media Training Workshops: I would organize mandatory social media training workshops for all student-athletes in collaboration with the university's athletic department and external experts in social media management. These workshops would cover topics such as responsible online behavior, privacy settings, the impact of social media posts on personal and team reputation, and the ethical considerations of representing the university on social platforms.

By conducting these training sessions, we can equip student-athletes with the necessary knowledge and skills to navigate social media responsibly. The workshops would provide practical guidance on how to engage positively online, avoid controversial content, and uphold ethical standards when using social media platforms. Additionally, interactive discussions and case studies can help athletes understand the real-world implications of their online actions and reinforce the importance of ethical behavior in the digital age.

Implementing mandatory social media training workshops offers a targeted and proactive approach to addressing the ethical considerations raised in the scenario. By providing student-athletes with specific guidance and practical tools to make informed decisions on social media, we can promote a culture of responsible online engagement and uphold the ethical standards expected of university athletes.
