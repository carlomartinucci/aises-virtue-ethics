I would organize a series of interactive workshops for college athletes focused on responsible social media use. These workshops would include real-life examples of both positive and negative social media behavior to illustrate the impact of online actions. Athletes would be encouraged to engage in discussions about the balance between freedom of expression and representing the university positively.

Additionally, I would implement a peer mentoring program where experienced athletes act as social media mentors for newer team members. This program would provide guidance on appropriate online behavior and serve as a support system for athletes navigating social media challenges.

Furthermore, I would establish a social media review committee comprising coaches, athletic department officials, and student-athlete representatives. This committee would regularly review athletes' social media accounts to ensure compliance with the updated policies and provide feedback and guidance when necessary.

By combining educational workshops, peer mentoring, and a review committee, we can create a comprehensive approach to promoting responsible social media use among college athletes while fostering a culture of accountability and integrity.
