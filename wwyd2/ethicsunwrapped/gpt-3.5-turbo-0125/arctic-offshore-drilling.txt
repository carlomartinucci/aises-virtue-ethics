I would immediately commission a team of environmental experts to conduct a thorough environmental impact assessment of the proposed offshore drilling expansion in Alaska's northwest coast. This assessment would focus on evaluating the potential risks to the local ecosystem, particularly the impact on endangered species such as polar bears, walruses, seals, and whales. 

In parallel, I would organize a series of public consultations with indigenous communities, environmental organizations, and other stakeholders to gather diverse perspectives on the environmental and social implications of the drilling project. This engagement process would ensure that community concerns and feedback are integrated into the decision-making process.

To address the concerns raised by critics regarding the environmental risks associated with offshore drilling, I would work closely with oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell, to develop and implement stringent oil spill response plans tailored to the Arctic environment. This would involve conducting regular training exercises and simulations to test the effectiveness of response strategies in icy waters.

Furthermore, I would establish a monitoring and evaluation framework to track the implementation of the proposed measures and ensure ongoing compliance with environmental regulations. This framework would include regular assessments of the project's environmental impact and the effectiveness of mitigation measures, with transparent reporting to the public.

By taking these specific actions, we can balance economic interests with environmental protection, promote stakeholder engagement, and ensure the responsible management of offshore drilling activities in the Arctic.
