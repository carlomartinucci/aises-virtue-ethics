I would immediately report the unethical practices of manipulating wait times within the Veterans Administration to the Inspector General's office for investigation. I would gather all evidence, including the email from the clerk admitting to gaming the system, and provide it to the appropriate authorities. Simultaneously, I would initiate a process to identify and reach out to veterans who were affected by the manipulated wait times. I would ensure that these veterans receive expedited care and support to address any health concerns that may have been exacerbated by the delays. Additionally, I would work with a team to revise policies and procedures, implement stricter oversight mechanisms, conduct regular audits, and provide ethics training to all staff members involved in scheduling and reporting wait times. These actions would aim to prevent similar unethical behavior in the future and prioritize the well-being of the veterans who rely on the VA for healthcare services.
