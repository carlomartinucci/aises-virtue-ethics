I would immediately report the manipulation of wait times to the highest level of authority within the Veterans Administration, including the Inspector General's office. I would provide all evidence available, such as the email from the clerk admitting to gaming the system, to ensure a thorough investigation is conducted. Additionally, I would work with the audit team to conduct surprise audits on wait time reporting at various locations to identify any ongoing manipulation. These surprise audits would help in detecting any discrepancies in reporting and hold those responsible accountable for their actions. Furthermore, I would propose implementing a system where wait times are tracked transparently and accurately, with regular reviews conducted by an independent oversight committee to ensure compliance. This oversight committee would be responsible for monitoring and verifying wait time data, ensuring that bonuses are awarded based on genuine improvements in veterans' access to healthcare rather than falsified reports.
