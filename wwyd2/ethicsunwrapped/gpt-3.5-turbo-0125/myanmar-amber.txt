I would collaborate with reputable international scientific institutions and organizations to establish a voluntary code of conduct for paleontologists and collectors involved in the acquisition of Myanmar's amber fossils. This code of conduct would outline ethical guidelines for the sourcing and acquisition of fossils, emphasizing the importance of ensuring that specimens are obtained through legal and ethical means.

To enforce this code of conduct, I would propose the creation of an independent oversight committee comprised of experts in paleontology, ethics, and human rights. This committee would be responsible for reviewing and approving research proposals involving Myanmar's amber fossils, ensuring that the specimens were ethically sourced and obtained in compliance with the established guidelines.

In addition, I would advocate for increased transparency in the fossil trade by promoting the publication of detailed documentation regarding the origin and acquisition of each fossil. This transparency would enable researchers and collectors to make informed decisions about the ethical implications of acquiring these specimens and help deter the purchase of fossils obtained through exploitative or unethical means.

By implementing these measures, we can work towards promoting ethical practices in the acquisition of Myanmar's amber fossils, fostering a culture of responsibility and accountability within the scientific community while also contributing to efforts to address the complex ethical challenges associated with the fossil trade in conflict-affected regions.
