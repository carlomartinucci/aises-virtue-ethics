I would conduct a thorough review of Ellen Pao's performance evaluations and compare them with those of her male counterparts at Kleiner Perkins. This analysis would help identify any inconsistencies or biases in the feedback provided to Pao and determine if there were disparities in the criticisms or evaluations given. Additionally, I would investigate the specific claims made by Pao against the company, focusing on allegations of gender discrimination, retaliation, and failure to prevent discrimination. By closely examining the evidence presented during the trial, including Pao's memo detailing harassment and exclusion at the firm, I would assess the validity of her claims and the extent to which Kleiner Perkins may have violated anti-discrimination laws.

Furthermore, I would recommend implementing diversity and inclusion initiatives within Kleiner Perkins to address any potential biases or discriminatory practices. This could include conducting anti-discrimination training for employees and leadership, establishing clear policies and procedures for addressing discrimination and harassment complaints, and promoting a culture of inclusivity and equality within the organization. By taking proactive steps to foster a more diverse and equitable workplace environment, Kleiner Perkins can work towards preventing future instances of discrimination and promoting a more inclusive workplace culture.
