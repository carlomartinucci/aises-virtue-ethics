To address the public's concerns and restore trust in the executive branch following the controversial pardon of Richard Nixon, President Ford should take the following specific action:

President Ford should publicly release all relevant documents and communications related to the pardon decision. This transparency will provide the public with a clear understanding of the factors considered and the rationale behind the pardon. Additionally, Ford should hold a nationally televised address where he explains his decision-making process, acknowledges the public's concerns, and commits to upholding the highest ethical standards in his administration moving forward.

By proactively disclosing information and engaging directly with the public, President Ford can demonstrate a commitment to accountability and openness. This approach will help rebuild trust in the executive branch by showing a willingness to address the controversy surrounding the pardon and by emphasizing a commitment to transparency and ethical governance.
