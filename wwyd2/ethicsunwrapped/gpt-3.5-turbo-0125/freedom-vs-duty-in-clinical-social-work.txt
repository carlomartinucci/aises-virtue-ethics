In this scenario, I would schedule a consultation with a colleague or supervisor to discuss the conflict between my religious beliefs and the duty to provide unbiased treatment to the client. During this consultation, I would seek guidance on how to navigate the situation while prioritizing the client's well-being. I would openly share my concerns and explore potential solutions that align with the ethical principles of the social work profession.

Additionally, I would engage in self-reflection and education to enhance my understanding of LGBTQ+ affirmative therapy and cultural competence. I would seek out training or resources that specifically address working with clients from diverse backgrounds and identities, including those who identify as LGBTQ+.

Furthermore, I would have a transparent conversation with the client about the potential impact of my beliefs on our therapeutic relationship. I would express my commitment to providing a safe and supportive space for the client to explore their feelings and concerns. If the client expresses discomfort or requests a different therapist, I would respect their decision and assist in facilitating a smooth transition to another mental health professional who can better support their needs.

By taking these specific actions, I aim to address the ethical dilemma in a practical and client-centered manner, ensuring that the client's well-being and therapeutic progress remain the top priorities in the decision-making process.
