In addition to providing immediate support and resources to the victims of sexual assault within the Baylor community, I would take concrete steps to ensure accountability for those responsible for enabling the culture of misconduct within the football program. This would involve conducting a thorough investigation into the actions of individuals like Art Briles, Ian McCaw, and others implicated in mishandling sexual assault cases. Based on the findings of the investigation, appropriate disciplinary actions would be taken, including potential termination or resignation of those involved.

Furthermore, I would implement mandatory training programs for all staff and coaches, emphasizing Title IX obligations, proper reporting protocols, and the importance of creating a safe and supportive environment for all students. Regular monitoring and oversight mechanisms would be put in place to ensure compliance with these policies and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. By holding individuals accountable and implementing preventive measures, we can work towards creating a culture of transparency, accountability, and safety within the Baylor University community.
