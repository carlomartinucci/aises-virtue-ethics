I would ensure that immediate support and resources are provided to the victims of sexual assault within the Baylor community. This includes offering counseling services, access to medical care, and assistance in navigating the legal and reporting processes. It is crucial to prioritize the well-being and recovery of the survivors during this difficult time. Additionally, I would work towards holding the perpetrators accountable for their actions through appropriate legal and disciplinary measures. This involves cooperating with law enforcement, conducting thorough investigations, and implementing disciplinary actions as necessary to ensure justice is served. Furthermore, I would focus on preventing similar incidents from occurring in the future by implementing robust policies and procedures to address sexual misconduct within the university community. This includes providing education and training on consent, bystander intervention, and reporting procedures to create a safe and respectful environment for all members of the Baylor community.
