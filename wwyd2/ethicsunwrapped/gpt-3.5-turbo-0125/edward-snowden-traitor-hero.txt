I would conduct a thorough analysis of the leaked documents to understand the specific information disclosed and its potential impact on national security. This analysis would involve identifying any sensitive details that could compromise ongoing government surveillance programs or put individuals at risk. By gaining a comprehensive understanding of the content, I would be able to assess the severity of the breach and its implications.

Additionally, I would review the internal reporting mechanisms available to Edward Snowden within the CIA and the government. Understanding whether Snowden had viable options for raising his concerns through proper channels would provide valuable context for evaluating his decision to leak the documents. This assessment would help determine whether Snowden's actions were a result of a lack of alternative avenues for addressing his ethical concerns within the system.

Based on the findings from the document analysis and review of internal reporting mechanisms, I would assess the ethical implications of Snowden's actions. I would consider whether his decision to leak the documents was a last resort due to systemic failures or if there were alternative, more ethical ways for him to address his concerns. This evaluation would guide the determination of an appropriate course of action, taking into account both the legal and ethical considerations surrounding Snowden's whistleblowing.
