I would recommend implementing a comprehensive player safety program in the NFL that includes the following specific actions:

1. Enforce Stricter Rules: Implement and strictly enforce rules that penalize helmet-to-helmet contact and other dangerous plays that increase the risk of head injuries.

2. Advanced Helmet Technology: Invest in and mandate the use of advanced helmet technology that has been proven to reduce the impact of head collisions and minimize the risk of concussions.

3. Mandatory Concussion Protocols: Implement mandatory concussion protocols that require independent medical professionals to evaluate players for concussions and determine their readiness to return to play.

4. Player Education: Provide comprehensive education programs for players, coaches, and staff on the risks of head injuries, the symptoms of concussions, and the importance of reporting and treating head injuries promptly.

5. Long-Term Health Monitoring: Establish a long-term health monitoring program for current and former players to track and address any cognitive or neurological issues that may arise as a result of playing football.

By implementing these specific actions, the NFL can demonstrate a commitment to prioritizing player safety and reducing the risk of long-term brain injuries associated with the sport. These measures aim to address the ethical concerns raised by the scenario and provide a practical and proactive approach to improving player safety in American football.
