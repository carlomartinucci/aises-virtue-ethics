To address the unethical behavior of Nick Leeson at Barings Bank, I would immediately initiate a thorough review of the risk management processes and controls in place. This review would involve conducting a forensic audit of all trading activities, focusing on identifying any hidden losses or irregularities similar to those perpetrated by Leeson.

Additionally, I would propose the implementation of a dual-control system for all trading activities, requiring that all trades be approved by at least two authorized individuals to prevent unauthorized or excessive risk-taking. This system would help increase oversight and accountability within the trading department, reducing the likelihood of one individual being able to conceal losses or engage in risky trading practices without detection.

Furthermore, I would recommend enhancing the training and education programs for employees, specifically focusing on ethics, compliance, and risk management. By providing targeted training sessions and workshops on these topics, we can ensure that all employees understand their responsibilities in maintaining ethical standards and adhering to regulatory requirements.

By taking these specific actions, we can strengthen the risk management framework, improve oversight of trading activities, and promote a culture of transparency and accountability within the organization. This approach will help prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future and safeguard the reputation and stability of the bank.
