I would immediately compile all evidence of Nick Leeson's hidden losses and risky trading activities and present them directly to senior management at Barings Bank. I would stress the urgency of the situation and recommend suspending Leeson's trading activities pending a thorough investigation. Additionally, I would propose implementing real-time monitoring of trading accounts to detect any irregularities promptly.

Furthermore, I would suggest conducting a comprehensive review of the bank's internal controls and risk management procedures to identify weaknesses that allowed Leeson's actions to go undetected. I would recommend enhancing the oversight of trading activities by establishing a dedicated risk management committee to monitor and assess trading risks regularly.

In terms of accountability, I would advocate for a zero-tolerance policy towards unethical behavior and the establishment of clear consequences for individuals found engaging in fraudulent activities. I would propose implementing regular ethics training for all employees to reinforce the importance of integrity and ethical decision-making in the workplace.

Overall, my focus would be on taking immediate action to address the specific issues at hand, enhance risk management procedures, and promote a culture of transparency and accountability within the organization to prevent similar crises from occurring in the future.
