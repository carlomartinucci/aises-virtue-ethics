One specific action to address the aftermath of the "Varsity Blues" scandal would be to implement a rigorous verification process for all college athletic recruits. This process would involve conducting thorough background checks on each student claiming to be a recruited athlete, including verifying their athletic achievements and participation in sports programs.

Additionally, colleges could require direct verification from high school coaches or sports organizations to confirm the student's athletic abilities and achievements. This verification process would help ensure that recruited athletes are genuinely talented and deserving of their athletic recruit status, thereby preventing fraudulent admissions through the "side door" method.

By implementing a strict verification process for recruited athletes, colleges can uphold the integrity of their admissions process and prevent future instances of fraud and bribery in college admissions. This practical step would add a layer of accountability and transparency to the recruitment process, safeguarding the fairness and credibility of college admissions for all students.
