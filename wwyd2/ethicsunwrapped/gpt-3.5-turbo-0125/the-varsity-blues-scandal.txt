To address the aftermath of the "Varsity Blues" scandal, I would propose the following concrete action:

1. Implement a Comprehensive Oversight System: Establish an independent oversight committee tasked with monitoring and auditing the college admissions process. This committee would consist of individuals with expertise in ethics, compliance, and education. Their responsibilities would include conducting regular audits of admissions practices, investigating any suspicious activities, and ensuring adherence to ethical standards.

By implementing a robust oversight system, colleges and universities can proactively detect and prevent fraudulent practices in the admissions process. This measure would provide an additional layer of accountability and transparency, helping to restore trust in the integrity of the admissions system.

This action directly addresses the need for increased oversight and accountability in college admissions, offering a practical solution to prevent future scandals and uphold ethical standards within the education sector.
