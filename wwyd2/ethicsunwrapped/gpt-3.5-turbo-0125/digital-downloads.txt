I would initiate direct discussions with artists and music industry stakeholders to gather insights on their specific needs and concerns regarding compensation in the digital music landscape. By engaging in open dialogues, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges artists face and identify practical solutions to enhance their compensation.

Additionally, I would propose the establishment of a task force comprising representatives from digital music platforms, artists, record labels, and industry experts. This task force would work collaboratively to develop transparent and fair payment structures that ensure artists receive equitable compensation for their work. By fostering collaboration and collective decision-making, we can create sustainable solutions that benefit all stakeholders involved.

Furthermore, I would advocate for the implementation of educational campaigns targeted at consumers to raise awareness about the importance of supporting artists through legal and ethical means. These campaigns would highlight the impact of piracy on artists' livelihoods and promote the use of legitimate platforms that prioritize fair compensation for artists. By empowering consumers with knowledge, we can drive positive change in the digital music industry and create a more supportive environment for artists.
