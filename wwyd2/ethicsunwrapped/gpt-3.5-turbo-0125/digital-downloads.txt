To address the critique and provide a more practical response to the scenario, I would focus on engaging with artists and industry stakeholders through targeted surveys and focus groups. By conducting these specific actions, I aim to gather valuable insights and perspectives on artist compensation in the digital music industry.

Firstly, I would design and distribute surveys to a diverse group of artists, including both established and emerging talents, to understand their experiences, challenges, and expectations regarding compensation from digital music platforms. The survey questions would cover topics such as revenue-sharing models, transparency in agreements, and the impact of streaming services on their income.

Secondly, I would organize focus groups with industry stakeholders, including representatives from digital music platforms, record labels, artist management companies, and legal experts. These focus groups would provide a platform for open discussions on the current state of artist compensation, potential improvements, and collaborative solutions to ensure fair and equitable payment for artists in the digital age.

By engaging directly with artists and industry stakeholders through surveys and focus groups, I aim to gather diverse perspectives, identify common concerns, and co-create actionable recommendations for enhancing artist compensation practices in the digital music industry. This approach prioritizes stakeholder engagement, collaboration, and practical solutions to drive positive change and promote ethical practices in the industry.
