In this scenario, if I were in Angela's position, I would immediately recuse myself from voting on the funding requests for the campus organizations, including the Hawaiian cultural club's luau event. I would then proactively inform another senator about my decision to recuse myself and the potential impact on the quorum. I would work collaboratively with the other senator to ensure that the vote is rescheduled promptly to avoid any unnecessary delays. Additionally, I would offer my assistance to the affected organizations during the delay by providing guidance on alternative funding sources or strategies to mitigate the impact of potential budget cuts. By taking these specific actions, I would uphold transparency, fairness, and integrity in the decision-making process while demonstrating my commitment to supporting all campus organizations.
