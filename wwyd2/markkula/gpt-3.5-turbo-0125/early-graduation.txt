In Grace's position, I would recommend that she have a candid conversation with the senior members of the student government about her intention to graduate early. During this discussion, Grace should propose a plan to identify a suitable replacement for her seat in the spring or suggest adjusting her responsibilities to ensure a smooth transition. By actively involving the senior members in finding a solution, Grace can demonstrate her commitment to the organization while also considering her personal circumstances. Additionally, Grace could offer to mentor and train her replacement to ensure a seamless handover of responsibilities. This approach would not only address the potential impact of her early graduation but also showcase her dedication to the organization's continuity and success.
