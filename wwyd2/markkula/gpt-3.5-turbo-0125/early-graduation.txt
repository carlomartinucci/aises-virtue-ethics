In Grace's position, I would recommend that she schedule a meeting with the senior members of the student government to discuss her situation openly and honestly. During this meeting, Grace should explain her plans to graduate early and the potential impact on her role as a senior class senator. She should seek input from the senior members on how best to proceed and address the issue of her early departure.

One specific action Grace could take is to propose a plan for a smooth transition in the spring quarter. This plan could involve identifying a capable successor to take over her responsibilities, providing training and support for the transition period, and ensuring that her ongoing initiatives are completed or handed over effectively. By actively involving the senior members in the decision-making process and demonstrating her commitment to fulfilling her duties despite the early graduation, Grace can work towards a solution that minimizes disruption and upholds the integrity of the student government.
