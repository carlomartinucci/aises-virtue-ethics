In Olivia's position, I would schedule a meeting with the current ASI president to discuss the timeline for implementing the initiatives for the Community Relations Branch. During the meeting, I would propose the idea of forming a planning committee consisting of diverse ASI members to oversee the development and execution of the events. This committee would ensure that decisions are made collaboratively and transparently.

I would suggest creating a shared document outlining the timeline and key milestones for the events, which would be accessible to all ASI members. This document would serve as a tool for accountability and transparency throughout the planning process.

Additionally, I would seek input from external stakeholders, such as faculty members or student representatives, to provide feedback on the proposed initiatives and ensure they align with the broader goals of the student body. This external perspective would help validate the initiatives and demonstrate a commitment to inclusivity and fairness.

By involving key stakeholders, establishing a transparent decision-making process, and seeking external input, I would aim to address the ethical concerns surrounding the timing of the initiatives and ensure that the planning process is conducted with integrity and fairness.
