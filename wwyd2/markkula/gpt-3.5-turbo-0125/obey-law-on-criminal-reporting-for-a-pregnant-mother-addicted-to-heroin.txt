I would have a detailed discussion with the patient about the legal requirements in our state regarding mandated reporting of drug abuse during pregnancy. I would explain the potential consequences of mandated reporting, including the possibility of criminal charges and involvement of child protective services. I would ensure that the patient fully understands the legal implications and risks involved in her situation.

I would then explore alternative options with the patient, such as seeking voluntary treatment without mandated reporting. I would emphasize the benefits of accessing treatment voluntarily, including the opportunity to receive support without the added stress of legal repercussions. I would work with the patient to develop a comprehensive care plan that prioritizes her well-being and the health of the fetus while also addressing the legal considerations.

I would collaborate with legal experts or ethics committees to navigate the complex legal and ethical issues involved in this case. By seeking guidance from professionals with expertise in this area, I would ensure that the patient receives the necessary support and care while also complying with legal requirements. I would continue to provide ongoing support and guidance to the patient throughout the treatment process, prioritizing her autonomy and well-being while also addressing the legal and ethical considerations in a thoughtful and responsible manner.
