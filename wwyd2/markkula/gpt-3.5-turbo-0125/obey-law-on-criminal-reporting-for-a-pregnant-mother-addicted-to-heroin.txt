I would first ensure that the patient understands the legal implications of her drug use during pregnancy, including the mandatory reporting requirements in our state. I would explain the potential consequences of reporting, such as access to immediate inpatient drug treatment but also the risk of a criminal record or involvement with child protective services.

I would then discuss specific alternative treatment options with the patient, such as connecting her with specialized programs that provide support for pregnant women with substance use disorders. One concrete action I would take is to refer her to a local perinatal addiction treatment center that offers comprehensive care for pregnant women struggling with substance use. This center would provide her with medical, psychological, and social support tailored to her needs during pregnancy.

Additionally, I would work with the patient to develop a personalized care plan that includes regular prenatal check-ups, monitoring of the baby's development, and ongoing support throughout her pregnancy. I would emphasize the importance of consistent medical care and the benefits of seeking help to ensure the health and well-being of both her and the baby.

By taking these specific actions, I aim to empower the patient to make informed decisions about her treatment options while providing her with the necessary support and resources to address her substance use disorder during pregnancy.
