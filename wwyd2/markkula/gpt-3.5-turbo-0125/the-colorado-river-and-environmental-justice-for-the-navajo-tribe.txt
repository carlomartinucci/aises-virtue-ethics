To address the exclusion of the Navajo tribe from the negotiations and decision-making processes regarding water allocation from the Colorado River, I would take the following specific action:

Establish a Navajo Nation Water Rights Task Force: I would propose the creation of a dedicated task force comprising representatives from the Navajo Nation, relevant state agencies, and federal authorities involved in water allocation discussions. This task force would serve as a platform for direct engagement, allowing Navajo voices to be heard and considered in the decision-making process.

The task force would be responsible for conducting regular meetings to discuss water allocation strategies, assess the impact of proposed cuts on the Navajo tribe, and advocate for the fair distribution of water resources. By actively involving Navajo representatives in these discussions, we can ensure that their perspectives, concerns, and rights are taken into account when making decisions that affect their access to water from the Colorado River.

This concrete action aims to address the historical exclusion of the Navajo tribe from water allocation negotiations and promote a more inclusive and equitable approach to managing water resources in the region. By establishing a dedicated task force, we can create a structured mechanism for collaboration and dialogue, ultimately leading to more ethical and fair outcomes for all stakeholders involved.
