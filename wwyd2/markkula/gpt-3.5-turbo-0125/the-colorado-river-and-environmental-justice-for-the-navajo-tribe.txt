I would immediately establish a dedicated task force that includes Navajo tribal leaders and representatives to ensure their active participation in the negotiations and decision-making processes regarding water allocation from the Colorado River. This task force would meet regularly to discuss the specific water access challenges faced by the Navajo tribe and work collaboratively to address these issues.

Additionally, I would prioritize investing in and improving water infrastructure on the Navajo reservation. This could involve partnering with relevant agencies and organizations to upgrade water treatment facilities, expand pipelines, and enhance distribution systems to provide safe and reliable water sources for all members of the Navajo Nation. By taking concrete actions to improve water access for the Navajo tribe, we can help alleviate the historical environmental injustices they have faced and promote equitable access to water resources.

Furthermore, I would advocate for the inclusion of Navajo representatives in the development of policies and agreements related to the Colorado River water allocation. Ensuring that the Navajo tribe has a seat at the table during these discussions is essential to address their unique water access challenges and ensure that their voices are heard in decision-making processes that directly impact their community.

Overall, by actively involving Navajo tribal leaders, investing in water infrastructure on the reservation, and advocating for their inclusion in water allocation discussions, we can work towards achieving a more ethical and inclusive approach to addressing the water access issues faced by the Navajo tribe amidst the Colorado River crisis.
