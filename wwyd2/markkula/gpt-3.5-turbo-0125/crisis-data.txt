I would immediately organize a virtual town hall meeting with all Crisis Text Line volunteers and users to address the concerns raised regarding the data-sharing agreement with Loris.ai. During the meeting, I would provide a detailed explanation of the agreement, its implications, and the organization's commitment to data privacy and ethical practices. This forum would allow volunteers and users to express their thoughts, ask questions, and provide feedback in real-time.

In parallel, I would appoint a dedicated task force comprising legal experts, data ethics specialists, and representatives from the volunteer community to conduct a thorough review of the data-sharing agreement. The task force would assess the agreement's compliance with data protection regulations, evaluate the transparency of user consent processes, and recommend any necessary revisions to enhance user understanding and privacy protection.

Furthermore, I would establish an Ethics Advisory Board within Crisis Text Line, composed of external experts in data ethics, privacy, and mental health advocacy. This board would provide ongoing guidance on ethical decision-making, review data-sharing practices, and ensure alignment with best practices in data privacy and user consent.

To ensure continuous engagement and transparency, I would implement a regular feedback mechanism, such as a dedicated email address or online form, for volunteers and users to submit their feedback and concerns anonymously. This feedback would be reviewed by the Ethics Advisory Board and incorporated into decision-making processes regarding data-sharing agreements and organizational policies.

Lastly, I would commit to providing quarterly updates to all stakeholders on the progress made in addressing the concerns raised, any changes implemented as a result of feedback received, and the organization's ongoing commitment to upholding ethical standards in data management and user privacy. Open and transparent communication will be essential in rebuilding trust and maintaining the organization's mission of supporting individuals in crisis with integrity and respect for their privacy.
