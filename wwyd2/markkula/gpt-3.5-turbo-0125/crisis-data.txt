To further enhance the response to the ethical concerns raised by the data-sharing agreement between Crisis Text Line and Loris.ai, I would specifically focus on the following action:

I would engage an independent ethics advisory board to conduct a thorough review of the data-sharing agreement and provide expert guidance on the ethical implications of the arrangement. The advisory board would consist of professionals with expertise in data ethics, mental health advocacy, and privacy rights. Their role would be to assess the agreement from a variety of ethical perspectives, ensuring that user consent is fully informed and respected.

By involving an independent ethics advisory board, Crisis Text Line can benefit from diverse insights and recommendations on how to navigate the complex ethical considerations surrounding data sharing in a mental health support context. This approach would add an additional layer of scrutiny and expertise to the evaluation process, helping to ensure that the organization upholds the highest ethical standards in its practices.
