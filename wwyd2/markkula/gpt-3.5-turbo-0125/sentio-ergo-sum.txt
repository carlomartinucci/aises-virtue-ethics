I would immediately implement a mandatory privacy impact assessment (PIA) to evaluate the potential risks to individuals' privacy and data protection posed by the use of the Cogito software at MetLife. The PIA would involve a detailed analysis of the data collection, processing, and storage practices of the software, as well as an assessment of the impact on employee and customer privacy rights.

Based on the findings of the PIA, I would work with the IT and data security teams to enhance data protection measures, including implementing end-to-end encryption for all data processed by the software and strengthening access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.

In addition, I would develop and implement clear and detailed disclosure policies to inform employees and customers about the specific types of analysis conducted by the software, the purposes for which the data is used, and the rights individuals have regarding their data. These policies would include obtaining explicit consent from all parties involved before any data is collected or analyzed.

To promote awareness and understanding of the software's analysis and data rights, I would provide comprehensive training and education sessions for employees and customers. These sessions would cover the implications of the software's monitoring and analysis, as well as the steps individuals can take to exercise their data rights and protect their privacy.

Lastly, I would establish a dedicated channel for feedback and reporting concerns related to the software's use. This channel would allow employees and customers to raise any issues or questions they may have about the software's impact on their privacy and data protection, enabling prompt resolution and maintaining a culture of transparency and accountability within the organization.
