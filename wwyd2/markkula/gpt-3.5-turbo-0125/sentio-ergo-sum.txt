To address the points raised in the critique and provide a more ethically sound and practical response to the scenario involving the use of the Cogito software at MetLife, I would take the following specific action:

Implement Regular Ethical Training Sessions:
I would introduce mandatory training sessions for all call-center agents using the Cogito software. These sessions would focus on the ethical implications of utilizing AI to analyze customer interactions, emphasizing the importance of respecting privacy, maintaining transparency, and ensuring that customer consent is obtained for any data analysis beyond standard call monitoring.

By providing targeted training on ethical considerations specific to the use of AI software like Cogito, employees would be better equipped to understand and navigate the ethical challenges that may arise in their daily interactions with customers. This proactive approach would help foster a culture of ethical awareness and responsibility among call-center agents, ultimately contributing to more ethical and transparent use of the software at MetLife.
