To address the points raised in the critique and provide a more ethically sound and practical response, Drake can take the following specific actions:

1. Organize a Funding Proposal Writing Workshop: Drake can schedule a workshop specifically focused on guiding student organizations through the funding proposal process. This workshop should cover essential elements of a successful proposal, common mistakes to avoid, and tips for maximizing the chances of approval. By making this workshop mandatory for all student organizations seeking funding, Drake ensures fairness and equal access to guidance.

By implementing this workshop, Drake can provide valuable support to all student organizations, including Alex's club, without showing favoritism. This approach promotes transparency and equity in the funding process while helping students improve their proposals effectively. Additionally, Drake can offer follow-up office hours or email support for individual questions or feedback to further assist student organizations in refining their proposals.
