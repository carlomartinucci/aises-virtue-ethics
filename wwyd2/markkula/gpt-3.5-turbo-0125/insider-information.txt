In this scenario, Drake should organize a drop-in office hours session specifically for student organizations to seek guidance on their funding proposals. During these office hours, Drake can provide individualized advice and feedback to any student group that requires assistance, including Alex's club. By offering this opportunity for personalized guidance in a structured and open setting, Drake ensures that all student organizations have access to support without compromising the fairness of the funding process.

Additionally, Drake can create a detailed FAQ document based on common questions and issues that arise during the office hours sessions. This document can be shared with all student organizations to provide additional guidance and support beyond the in-person sessions. By proactively addressing common concerns and providing resources for self-help, Drake empowers student groups to improve their funding proposals while maintaining a level playing field for all organizations.

By implementing these strategies, Drake can ethically assist Alex and other student organizations in refining their funding proposals while upholding the integrity and transparency of the funding process. This approach demonstrates a commitment to fairness and support for all student groups while navigating the ethical considerations of providing personalized guidance in a resource-constrained environment.
