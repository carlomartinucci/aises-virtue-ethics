To address the concerns raised in the scenario, Tyler should consider the following specific actions:

1. **Prioritize Constituent Engagement Projects:** Tyler should identify one committee project that he can delegate or reduce his involvement in to free up time for engaging with his constituents. By selecting a project that aligns least with his passion or expertise, Tyler can ensure that he maintains his commitment to the committee's goals while also creating space for connecting with his constituency.

By communicating openly with his committee members about his decision and seeking their understanding, Tyler can demonstrate his dedication to representing his constituents effectively. This approach allows Tyler to balance his responsibilities without compromising his reputation within the Senate.

By taking these steps, Tyler can actively address his concerns about connecting with his constituency while maintaining a productive presence within the Senate and the University Affairs Committee.
