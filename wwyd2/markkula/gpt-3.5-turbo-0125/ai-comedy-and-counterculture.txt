I would initiate a dialogue with the George Carlin estate and his daughter to discuss the ethical implications of AI-generated content featuring Carlin's likeness. I would propose the creation of a formal agreement that outlines the terms and conditions for the use of Carlin's persona in AI-generated projects. This agreement would require obtaining explicit permission from the estate for any future AI-generated content featuring Carlin. Additionally, I would suggest establishing guidelines for the respectful portrayal of Carlin's legacy in such projects, ensuring that his views and values are accurately represented. By collaborating with the estate and family to create a clear framework, we can address the ethical concerns raised by unauthorized AI-generated content and protect the integrity of Carlin's work.
