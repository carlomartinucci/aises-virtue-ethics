To address the issue of vague consent resources for neurodiverse college students, I would take the following concrete steps:

1. **Consult with Neurodiversity Experts**: I would reach out to experts in neurodiversity, such as psychologists specializing in neurodiverse populations or organizations advocating for neurodiverse individuals. By consulting with these experts, I aim to gain insights into the specific communication challenges faced by neurodiverse students in social situations and gather recommendations on how to make consent guidelines more accessible to this population.

2. **Conduct Focus Groups with Neurodiverse Students**: I would organize focus groups specifically with neurodiverse students to gather direct feedback on the current consent resources provided by the university. Through these focus groups, I aim to understand the specific difficulties neurodiverse students encounter in interpreting consent cues and gather suggestions on how to improve the materials to make them more concrete and understandable.

3. **Develop Concrete and Universally Applicable Guidelines**: Based on the insights gathered from neurodiversity experts and feedback from neurodiverse students, I would work on revising the consent resources to provide clear, concrete, and universally applicable guidelines. This may involve creating visual aids, step-by-step instructions, and examples that explicitly outline what consent looks like in various social situations, ensuring that neurodiverse students can easily comprehend and apply the information.

4. **Establish Ongoing Feedback Mechanisms**: To ensure the effectiveness and relevance of the revised materials, I would establish ongoing feedback mechanisms with neurodiverse students and experts in neurodiversity. Regularly seeking feedback and making necessary adjustments to the resources based on this input will help in continuously improving the accessibility and usefulness of the consent guidelines for neurodiverse individuals.

By taking these specific actions, I aim to address the shortcomings in the current consent resources provided by the university and create more inclusive, practical, and effective guidelines for neurodiverse college students, ultimately contributing to a safer and more supportive campus environment.
