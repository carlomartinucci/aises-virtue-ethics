I would collaborate with a diverse group of neurodiverse individuals to co-create new resources on consent that are clear, concrete, and universally applicable. This would involve organizing focus groups, conducting interviews, and gathering feedback to ensure that the materials are tailored to the specific needs and preferences of neurodiverse students. Additionally, I would work with experts in neurodiversity and sexual assault prevention to incorporate best practices and insights into the development of these resources. By involving neurodiverse individuals in the design and creation process, we can ensure that the materials are not only accessible but also resonate with the target audience on a deeper level. This approach would prioritize inclusivity, collaboration, and the ethical consideration of diverse perspectives in addressing the issue at hand.
