To address the points raised in the critique and provide a more practical response, I would recommend implementing a user-friendly two-factor authentication (2FA) system for added security without compromising user experience. This would involve users verifying their identity through a second method, such as a unique code sent to their registered email or phone number, in addition to their password. By incorporating 2FA, First Date can enhance security measures while ensuring a seamless user experience.
