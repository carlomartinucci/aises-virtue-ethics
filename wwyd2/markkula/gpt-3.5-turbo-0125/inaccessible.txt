I would immediately arrange for Michelle to receive the necessary treatment for her stage three decubitus ulcer, including wound care, IV antibiotics for bacteremia, and consultation with surgery. I would also ensure that she receives appropriate follow-up care to monitor her condition and prevent further complications. Additionally, I would schedule a meeting with clinic management to discuss the urgent need for accessible equipment, such as examination tables and weight scales, for patients with disabilities. I would request that a plan be put in place to acquire this equipment to ensure that all patients, including those in wheelchairs like Michelle, can receive proper care during their appointments. Furthermore, I would work with the physician assigned to Michelle's care to provide specialized training in treating patients with mobility disabilities, focusing on proper examination techniques for patients in wheelchairs to prevent oversights like missing sacral ulcers. Finally, I would establish a protocol within the clinic to ensure that all patients, regardless of their physical abilities, receive the necessary accommodations and care during their appointments.
