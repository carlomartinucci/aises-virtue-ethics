I would immediately address Michelle's current medical needs by arranging for her to receive appropriate treatment for her stage three decubitus ulcer, including wound care, IV antibiotics for bacteremia, and consultation with surgery. Additionally, I would work with the clinic management to prioritize the acquisition of accessible equipment such as adjustable examination tables and scales for patients with mobility disabilities. I would also schedule additional training sessions for all healthcare staff, including the physician assigned to Michelle's care, on how to properly treat patients with mobility disabilities. Furthermore, I would ensure that there is always sufficient staff available to assist patients like Michelle onto the exam table when needed. Lastly, I would collaborate with the clinic to develop a protocol for accommodating patients with disabilities to prevent similar oversights in the future.
