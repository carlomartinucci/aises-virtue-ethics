I would advise Nadia to disclose her involvement in the student organization dedicated to social activism and service learning at the beginning of the article about the protest. By including a brief statement explaining her affiliation with the organization, Nadia can be transparent with her readers about her potential biases. This disclosure will help maintain her credibility as a fair and objective reporter.

Additionally, I would recommend that Nadia actively seek out and include quotes from individuals who may have differing perspectives on the working conditions of the custodial staff. By interviewing a diverse range of sources, including those who may not support the protest or have different opinions on the issue, Nadia can provide a more balanced and comprehensive view in her reporting.

Furthermore, I would suggest that Nadia fact-check all information gathered during her interviews and verify the accuracy of the details presented in her article. This diligence in confirming the information received will help mitigate any unintentional bias that may arise from her personal connections to the organization.

Overall, by disclosing her involvement, seeking diverse perspectives, and ensuring the accuracy of her reporting, Nadia can navigate her ties to the organization ethically and produce a well-rounded and objective article on the protest.
