After scheduling a private meeting with Julia to discuss the issue of her misuse of office resources, I would propose a specific plan to address the situation. During the meeting, I would emphasize the impact of her actions on the organization's budget and student programs, highlighting the need to prioritize the efficient use of resources. I would suggest implementing a system where personal printing costs are reimbursed by individuals to offset the organization's expenses.

If Julia remains resistant to change or continues to misuse resources after our discussion, I would seek guidance from the student government advisor or a higher authority within the organization. I would document the instances of misuse and present a formal report outlining the financial implications and potential solutions to mitigate the problem. By involving the appropriate authorities, we can ensure that the issue is addressed effectively and ethically, while also upholding the integrity of the organization.
