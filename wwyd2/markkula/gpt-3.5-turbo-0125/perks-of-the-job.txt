I would schedule a private meeting with Julia to discuss the issue of her misuse of office resources. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about the impact on the organization's budget and suggest finding alternative solutions, such as using her own personal resources for homework. I would emphasize the importance of setting a good example for other members and adhering to the rules and guidelines for resource use. If Julia continues to misuse office resources after the meeting, I would seek guidance from higher authorities within the organization to address the situation effectively.
