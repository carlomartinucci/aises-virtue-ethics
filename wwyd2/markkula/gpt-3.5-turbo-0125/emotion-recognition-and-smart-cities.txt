I would organize a series of public forums and online surveys to gather feedback from the city's residents regarding the proposal to grant a technology company access to video recordings from smart light posts for emotion-recognition AI purposes. This engagement process would provide an opportunity for community members to express their concerns, ask questions, and share their perspectives on the potential use of their data.

Based on the feedback received, I would prioritize transparency and accountability in negotiations with the technology company. I would ensure that strict terms are established in the agreement, including clear limitations on data use, stringent data protection measures, and provisions for regular audits of the company's practices. Additionally, I would require the company to provide detailed reports on how the data is being used and ensure mechanisms are in place for reporting any breaches or misuse of the information.

Furthermore, I would collaborate with legal experts to conduct a thorough review of the technology company's data protection measures and assess compliance with privacy laws and regulations. This legal assessment would help identify any potential risks or gaps in data security and ensure that the company's practices align with industry best practices.

By engaging with the community, negotiating stringent terms with the technology company, and conducting a legal review of data protection measures, I aim to balance the potential benefits of the proposal with the protection of individuals' privacy rights and the trust of the community.
