If I were Akira, I would acknowledge the senator's concerns and emphasize the importance of maintaining confidentiality in disciplinary matters to protect the privacy and dignity of the individuals involved. I would explain that while there are no specific bylaws outlining the right to clear the room, it is a common practice in governmental and organizational settings to discuss sensitive issues in private to ensure fairness and respect for all parties.

To address the senator's demand for transparency, I would offer to provide a summary of the meeting proceedings and decisions to all student government members after the meeting. This way, the senator and other members can be informed about the outcome while still respecting the need for confidentiality during the discussion.

If the senator continues to insist on staying, I would reiterate the reasons for requesting confidentiality and the potential consequences of compromising the privacy of the individuals involved. I would express my willingness to address any questions or concerns the senator may have after the meeting to ensure that his perspective is heard and considered in a respectful manner.

By balancing the need for confidentiality with a commitment to transparency through post-meeting communication, I aim to uphold ethical principles while effectively managing the situation within the student government context.
