I would address the situation by respectfully reiterating to the senator the importance of maintaining confidentiality during the discussion of sensitive disciplinary matters. I would explain that the privacy and well-being of the individuals involved are paramount and that discussing the issue in a private setting first is crucial to ensure a fair and thorough assessment of the situation. I would offer to provide a summary of the proceedings after the meeting to uphold transparency while still protecting the privacy of those involved. If the senator continues to insist on staying, I would suggest that he submit any questions or concerns in writing to be addressed promptly following the meeting. This approach aims to balance the need for confidentiality with transparency and accountability, ensuring that all perspectives are considered while upholding the integrity of the student government's processes.
