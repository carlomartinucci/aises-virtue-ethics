One concrete action to address the ethical concerns surrounding the use of AI-detection tools in educational settings is to implement a mandatory training program for both educators and students on the responsible use and interpretation of AI-generated results. This training program should include the following components:

1. Educators Training:
- Provide detailed guidance on how to interpret AI-generated results and distinguish between AI-written and human-written text.
- Offer strategies for addressing false positives and false negatives in AI-detection reports.
- Emphasize the supplementary nature of AI-detection tools and the importance of using them as one of several measures to assess academic integrity.
- Educate educators on supporting students who are flagged for plagiarism by AI tools, including how to investigate and address potential cases of misidentification.

2. Students Training:
- Educate students on the implications of using AI-generated content in their assignments and the importance of academic integrity.
- Provide guidance on how to properly cite and reference sources, including AI-generated text, to avoid unintentional plagiarism.
- Offer practical tips on how to review and verify their work for authenticity before submission.
- Raise awareness about the limitations of AI-detection tools and how to navigate potential challenges if flagged for plagiarism.

By implementing a comprehensive training program for both educators and students, educational institutions can promote ethical practices, enhance transparency in the use of AI-detection tools, and empower individuals to navigate the complexities of academic integrity in the digital age effectively.
