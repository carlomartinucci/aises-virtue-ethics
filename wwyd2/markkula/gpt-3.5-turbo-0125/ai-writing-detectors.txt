To address the ethical concerns raised by the use of AI-detection tools in educational settings, I would focus on the following specific actions:

1. Establishing a Task Force: I would form a task force consisting of educators, students, AI experts, and representatives from academic integrity offices. This task force would be responsible for conducting a thorough review of the current practices and impacts of AI-detection tools in educational institutions.

2. Conducting a Pilot Study: The task force would conduct a pilot study involving a diverse group of students, including non-native English speakers, to evaluate the accuracy and fairness of AI-detection tools. The results of this study would be used to identify any biases or inaccuracies in the tools when analyzing texts from different linguistic backgrounds.

3. Developing Tailored Guidelines: Based on the findings from the pilot study, the task force would develop specific guidelines for educators on how to interpret the results of AI-detection tools. These guidelines would include recommendations on how to avoid unfair accusations against students, especially those from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

4. Implementing Training Programs: I would work with educational institutions to implement mandatory training programs for educators and students on the ethical use of AI-detection tools. These programs would focus on raising awareness about the limitations of these tools and promoting a culture of academic integrity beyond automated detection.

5. Advocating for Transparency: The task force would advocate for transparency in the use of AI-detection tools by educational institutions. This would involve recommending that institutions disclose their use of these tools to students, along with providing information on how the tools work and their potential limitations.

By taking these specific actions, we can work towards ensuring that AI-detection tools are used ethically and responsibly in educational settings, minimizing the risk of unfair accusations and penalties for students, particularly those who may be disproportionately affected by the limitations of these tools.
