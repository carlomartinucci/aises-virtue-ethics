In response to the scenario, I would recommend that the company Rx take the following concrete actions:

1. Provide ongoing access to the drug: Rx should establish a post-trial support program to ensure that the participants in Russia have continued access to the arthritis drug at an affordable cost or for free, especially for those who cannot afford it. This will help prevent the participants from experiencing negative health consequences due to discontinuing treatment.

By implementing this program, Rx can demonstrate a commitment to the well-being of the participants and mitigate the potential harm caused by the abrupt cessation of treatment after the trial ends. This action aligns with ethical principles of beneficence and non-maleficence by prioritizing the health and welfare of the trial participants.

By taking these steps, Rx can uphold ethical standards and fulfill its responsibility to the participants in the clinical trial, ensuring that they continue to benefit from the successful outcomes of the trial and maintain their health and well-being in the long term.
