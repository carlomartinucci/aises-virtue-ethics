To address the ethical concerns raised in the scenario, I would recommend that the pharmaceutical company Rx establish a comprehensive post-trial care program for the participants in Russia. This program should include continued access to the arthritis treatment for those who benefited from it during the trial but cannot afford it. Additionally, Rx should collaborate with local healthcare providers in Russia to ensure that the participants receive ongoing medical care and support.

Furthermore, to address the issue of participants' lack of relevant educational background, Rx should implement educational initiatives aimed at improving participants' understanding of the treatment they received. This could involve providing educational materials in a simplified format, conducting informational sessions, or partnering with local community organizations to offer health education programs.

By taking these concrete actions, Rx can demonstrate a commitment to the well-being of the trial participants and ensure that they receive the necessary support and care following the conclusion of the clinical trial.
