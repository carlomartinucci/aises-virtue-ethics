One specific action I would take in response to the scenario is to implement mandatory diversity and inclusion training for all employees at Google. This training would cover topics such as unconscious bias, gender stereotypes, and creating an inclusive work environment. By providing regular and comprehensive training sessions, employees can gain a better understanding of the impact of their words and actions on their colleagues and the overall workplace culture. This proactive approach can help prevent discriminatory incidents, promote empathy and understanding among employees, and contribute to a more inclusive and respectful work environment at Google.
