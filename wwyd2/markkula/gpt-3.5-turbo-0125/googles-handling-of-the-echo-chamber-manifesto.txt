To address the issues raised in the scenario, I would first prioritize implementing a comprehensive diversity and inclusion training program tailored to address unconscious biases and promote respectful communication among employees. This training would be mandatory for all employees, including leadership, to ensure a shared understanding of the company's commitment to diversity and inclusion.

Additionally, I would establish a dedicated reporting system for employees to confidentially report instances of discrimination or harassment. This system would include clear procedures for investigating reports promptly and taking appropriate action to address any violations of the company's code of conduct.

Furthermore, I would create a support network for employees who have experienced discrimination or harassment, providing access to counseling services and resources to help them navigate the situation. This support system would prioritize the well-being of affected employees and ensure they feel safe and supported in the workplace.

By taking these specific actions, Google can proactively address discriminatory behavior, foster a culture of accountability, and create a more inclusive and respectful work environment for all employees.
