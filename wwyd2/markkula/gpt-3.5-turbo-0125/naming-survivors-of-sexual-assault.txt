To address Alexandra's concerns while maintaining ethical standards, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Redact Alexandra's name and any identifying information from the article to protect her privacy and confidentiality. I would also discuss with Alexandra the option of using a pseudonym to further safeguard her identity.

2. Include a statement in the article emphasizing the importance of supporting survivors of sexual assault and dispelling myths about false reporting. This statement would highlight the courage it takes for survivors to come forward and the need for a safe and respectful environment for seeking justice.

3. Consult with experts in sexual assault advocacy to review the article and ensure that it accurately represents the experiences of survivors while providing a balanced perspective on the federal guidelines. Their input would help strengthen the article's credibility and sensitivity to the complexities of sexual assault cases on college campuses.
