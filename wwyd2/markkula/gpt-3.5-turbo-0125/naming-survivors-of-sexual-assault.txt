I would ensure Alexandra's confidentiality by redacting her name and any identifying details from the article. I will also offer her the opportunity to review the redacted version before publication to obtain her consent. To address the potential stigma surrounding reporting sexual assault cases, I will include a statement in the article emphasizing the importance of supporting survivors and the challenges they face in coming forward. Additionally, I will provide information on resources available for survivors, such as counseling services and support groups, to encourage a more supportive and understanding environment for those who have experienced sexual assault.
