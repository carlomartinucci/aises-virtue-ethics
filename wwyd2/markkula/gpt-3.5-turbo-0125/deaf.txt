To address the scenario more effectively, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Efficiently manage time: Upon Ali's request to communicate via pen and paper for a sensitive health concern, I would promptly review the list of health concerns he had prepared in advance. By quickly identifying the most urgent issues, such as shortness of breath, I would prioritize addressing these within the remaining time of the appointment slot. This proactive approach would ensure that critical health concerns are not overlooked and that Ali receives timely attention for his immediate needs.

By optimizing time management and focusing on addressing urgent health issues promptly, we can enhance the quality of care provided to Ali and potentially prevent adverse health outcomes.
