I would conduct a thorough review of American Apparel's marketing strategies and practices, particularly those related to using sex to sell clothes. This review would involve assessing the ethical implications of such marketing tactics and determining whether they align with the company's values of passion, innovation, and ethical practices in the clothing industry.

Based on the findings of the review, I would work with the marketing team to develop alternative strategies that prioritize respect, inclusivity, and professionalism in the company's advertising and branding efforts. This may involve shifting towards more socially responsible and culturally sensitive marketing campaigns that do not rely on sexualized imagery or objectification.

Additionally, I would implement training programs for employees at all levels to raise awareness about appropriate workplace behavior, including the importance of maintaining a respectful and harassment-free environment. These training sessions would emphasize the company's zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment and misconduct, and provide employees with the tools and resources to report any concerns or violations.

Furthermore, I would engage with external consultants or experts in ethics and corporate responsibility to provide guidance on best practices for promoting a culture of integrity and ethical conduct within the organization. This external perspective can offer valuable insights and recommendations for enhancing the company's ethical framework and ensuring alignment with industry standards and societal expectations.

Overall, my focus would be on promoting ethical marketing practices, fostering a culture of respect and professionalism, and upholding the values of passion, innovation, and ethical practices at American Apparel.
