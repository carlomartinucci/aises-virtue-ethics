To enhance user privacy and data protection in the URVR app, I would implement a clear and user-friendly opt-in process for sharing 360 degree videos and images. This process would include a detailed explanation of how their data will be used and shared, along with specific options for setting privacy preferences for each piece of content shared. Users would be prompted to make these selections before uploading any content.

Additionally, I would introduce end-to-end encryption for all data transmissions within the app to ensure that user content remains secure and protected from unauthorized access. Regular security audits would be conducted to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities in the system.

In the event of a privacy breach, affected users would be promptly notified, provided with detailed information about the incident, and offered support and resources to mitigate any potential harm. Transparency and swift action in response to such incidents are crucial in maintaining user trust and upholding ethical standards in data handling.
