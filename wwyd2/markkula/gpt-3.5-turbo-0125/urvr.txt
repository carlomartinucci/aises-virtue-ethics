To address the potential user experience implications while still prioritizing user privacy in the scenario described, I would implement a user-friendly onboarding process that educates users about the importance of privacy settings and consent before sharing 360 degree videos or images. This onboarding process would include interactive tutorials and clear explanations of how to set privacy preferences for each piece of content.

Additionally, I would introduce a default privacy setting that allows users to easily select their preferred level of privacy for all shared content. This default setting would serve as a baseline for users who may not want to customize privacy settings for each individual moment captured. Users can then adjust these settings as needed, providing flexibility while maintaining a strong focus on privacy.

By combining a user-friendly onboarding process with default privacy settings, users can quickly and easily navigate the platform while still having control over their shared moments. This approach strikes a balance between enhancing user privacy and maintaining a seamless user experience, ultimately fostering trust and transparency within the URVR community.
