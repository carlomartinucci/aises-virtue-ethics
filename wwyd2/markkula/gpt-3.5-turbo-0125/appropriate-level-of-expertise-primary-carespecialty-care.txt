I would schedule a follow-up appointment with Peter to have a detailed discussion about the potential impact of untreated bipolar disorder on his life. During this appointment, I would provide specific examples of how bipolar disorder can affect his job performance, relationships, and overall mental health. I would also involve his family in the conversation to provide additional support and encouragement.

If Peter continues to refuse to see a psychiatrist, I would offer to contact the psychiatrist myself to discuss the situation and explore potential options for a more comfortable evaluation process. I would also suggest a trial period of therapy with a psychologist or social worker to help Peter better understand his mental health needs and the benefits of specialized care.

Additionally, I would document our discussions thoroughly in Peter's medical records and collaborate with other healthcare professionals involved in his care to ensure a coordinated approach. I would continue to monitor his symptoms closely and provide ongoing support and guidance to help him make informed decisions about his mental health treatment.
