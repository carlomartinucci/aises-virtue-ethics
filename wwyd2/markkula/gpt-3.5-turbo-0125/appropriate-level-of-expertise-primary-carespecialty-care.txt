I would schedule a longer appointment with Peter to have a detailed conversation about his mental health concerns. During this appointment, I would actively listen to Peter's reasons for refusing to see a psychiatrist and address any fears or misconceptions he may have. I would emphasize the importance of seeking specialized care for a comprehensive evaluation and appropriate treatment of his symptoms.

To address Peter's resistance, I would explore alternative options that align with his preferences. For example, I could suggest a telehealth consultation with a psychiatrist as a more convenient and comfortable option for him. I would also offer to accompany Peter to the initial appointment to provide support and reassurance.

Involving Peter's family in the discussion could provide additional encouragement and support for him to seek help. With Peter's consent, I would reach out to his family to discuss the importance of professional evaluation for his mental health concerns and enlist their assistance in encouraging him to follow through with the referral to a psychiatrist.

After the appointment, I would follow up with Peter to check on his progress and offer ongoing support. I would document our conversations and any agreed-upon plans in his medical records to ensure continuity of care and facilitate collaboration with other healthcare providers.
