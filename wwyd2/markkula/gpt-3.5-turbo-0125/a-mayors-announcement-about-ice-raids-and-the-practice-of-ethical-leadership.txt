In response to the critique, I would recommend that Mayor Schaaf publicly acknowledge the unintended consequences of her decision to announce the ICE raids. She should take responsibility for any negative outcomes, such as the potential evasion of individuals with criminal records due to the advance warning. Additionally, Mayor Schaaf should issue a statement expressing her commitment to working with ICE to address their concerns and improve communication in the future. By demonstrating accountability and a willingness to collaborate with federal authorities, Mayor Schaaf can show a genuine effort to mitigate the impact of her actions and foster a more constructive relationship between local and federal agencies.
