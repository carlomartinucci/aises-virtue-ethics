I would recommend that Mayor Schaaf issue a public statement addressing the concerns raised by critics regarding her decision to announce the ICE raids. In the statement, she should emphasize the importance of public safety while also acknowledging the need to balance this with the rights and well-being of undocumented immigrants. Mayor Schaaf should commit to working collaboratively with ICE officials to address their concerns and find common ground in ensuring the safety of all residents.
