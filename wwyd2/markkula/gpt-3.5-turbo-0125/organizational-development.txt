To address the increased cost of the retreat site, I would first review the student government budget to identify potential areas where costs can be reduced or reallocated. One specific action I would take is to assess the budget for any non-essential expenses that could be temporarily suspended or reduced to free up funds for the retreat. For example, I would look into cutting down on unnecessary office supplies or non-essential travel expenses within the student government.

Additionally, I would reach out to the retreat site management to discuss the price increase and explore the possibility of negotiating for a discount or a payment plan that could help alleviate the financial burden. I would highlight the long-standing partnership with the site and the positive impact the retreat has had on student government members to emphasize the importance of maintaining the retreat at the current location.

Furthermore, I would engage with student government members to gather their input on potential solutions. I would communicate transparently about the budget constraints and seek their ideas on how to address the financial challenge while ensuring the retreat's continuation. By involving the members in the decision-making process, we can collectively brainstorm creative solutions and prioritize the most impactful programs for the student body while maintaining the essential retreat for student government leaders.
