To address the financial challenge of the doubled cost for the student government retreat, Carlos should first conduct a detailed review of the budget to identify areas where costs can be reduced or reallocated. He should prioritize essential expenses for the retreat while looking for potential savings in non-essential areas. One specific action he can take is to explore the possibility of downsizing certain aspects of the retreat, such as reducing the number of workshops or activities, to lower costs without compromising the overall experience significantly.

Additionally, Carlos should proactively engage with the student government members to discuss the budget constraints and seek their input on potential solutions. By involving the members in the decision-making process, Carlos can foster a sense of ownership and collaboration within the organization. One concrete step he can take is to organize a brainstorming session or survey to gather ideas on cost-saving measures or alternative funding sources from the student government members.

Furthermore, Carlos should reach out to alumni, local businesses, or community organizations to explore sponsorship opportunities for the retreat. One specific action he can take is to create a sponsorship package outlining the benefits of supporting the retreat, such as visibility at the event or recognition in promotional materials, to attract potential sponsors and secure additional funding.

By implementing these specific actions, Carlos can address the financial challenge ethically and practically, ensuring the continuation of the valuable off-campus retreat experience for student government members while maintaining transparency and collaboration within the organization.
