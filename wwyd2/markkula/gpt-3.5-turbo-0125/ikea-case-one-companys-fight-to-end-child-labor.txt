To address the issue of child labor in its supply chain, IKEA should implement a Child Labor Remediation Program. This program would involve the following steps:

1. Conducting thorough audits: IKEA should conduct regular and surprise audits at supplier factories in high-risk countries to identify any instances of child labor. Auditors should be trained to recognize signs of child labor and take immediate action if violations are found.

2. Remediation efforts: Upon discovering instances of child labor, IKEA should work with suppliers to implement remediation measures. This could include providing education and support for affected children, ensuring they are removed from hazardous work environments, and offering alternative opportunities for their families.

3. Collaboration with stakeholders: IKEA should collaborate with local NGOs, labor rights organizations, and government agencies to strengthen monitoring efforts and support remediation initiatives. By working together with external partners, IKEA can leverage their expertise and resources to address the root causes of child labor.

4. Transparency and reporting: IKEA should maintain transparency in its supply chain practices by publicly disclosing information about its efforts to combat child labor. Regular reporting on audit findings, remediation actions, and progress made in eliminating child labor will demonstrate the company's commitment to ethical sourcing practices.

By implementing a Child Labor Remediation Program, IKEA can take concrete steps to address the issue of child labor in its supply chain, uphold ethical standards, and protect the rights of vulnerable workers, particularly children. This proactive approach will not only help IKEA mitigate reputational risks but also contribute to positive social impact in the communities where its products are sourced.
