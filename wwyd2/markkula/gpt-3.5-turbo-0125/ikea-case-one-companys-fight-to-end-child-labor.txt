To address the issue of child labor in its supply chain, IKEA should take the following specific action:

Implement a comprehensive supplier audit program that includes unannounced visits to supplier factories in high-risk countries. This program should involve trained auditors who specialize in labor rights and child labor issues. The audits should focus on verifying compliance with ethical sourcing standards, specifically regarding child labor laws and regulations.

By conducting regular and unannounced audits, IKEA can proactively identify and address instances of child labor in its supply chain. The trained auditors should work closely with local stakeholders, such as NGOs and labor rights organizations, to ensure thorough inspections and accurate reporting. Any findings of child labor should be addressed immediately through corrective action plans and monitoring mechanisms.

Additionally, IKEA should establish a Supplier Code of Conduct that explicitly prohibits the use of child labor and outlines the consequences for non-compliance. Suppliers should be required to sign and adhere to this code as a condition of doing business with IKEA. Regular training sessions and workshops on labor rights and ethical sourcing practices should also be provided to suppliers to raise awareness and promote compliance.

By implementing a robust supplier audit program, establishing a clear Supplier Code of Conduct, and providing ongoing training to suppliers, IKEA can demonstrate its commitment to eradicating child labor from its supply chain. These specific actions will help ensure ethical sourcing practices, protect vulnerable workers, and uphold IKEA's reputation as a socially responsible company.
