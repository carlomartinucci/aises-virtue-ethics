I would recommend that Hana reaches out to mental health professionals or campus counselors for guidance on how to approach the sensitive topic of covering the student's death by suicide. They can provide valuable insights on how to frame the article in a way that promotes mental health awareness while minimizing the risk of harm. 

In the article, Hana should focus on celebrating the student's life and contributions to the campus community, highlighting his involvement in student government, environmental justice advocacy, and interfaith programming. She can interview friends, faculty, and staff who knew the student well to share positive memories and insights about his impact.

To address the risks associated with the contagion theory, Hana should avoid including graphic details of the death and instead emphasize messages of hope, resilience, and the importance of seeking help. Including helpline information and resources for mental health support in the article can also provide valuable assistance to those who may be struggling.

By taking these steps, Hana can create a respectful and informative tribute to the student's memory while initiating an important dialogue about mental health resources and support on campus.
