In addition to scheduling a face-to-face meeting with Alanna, I would take the time to conduct a thorough review of the past collaborations between student government and RHA to identify any potential underlying issues that may have led to Alanna's lukewarm response and negative comments. This review would involve gathering feedback from past events, assessing communication patterns, and understanding any past conflicts or challenges that may have impacted the relationship.

During the meeting with Alanna, I would approach the discussion with empathy and active listening, seeking to understand her perspective and concerns fully. I would acknowledge any past grievances or misunderstandings and work towards finding common ground to rebuild trust and collaboration. I would propose a detailed plan of action that addresses the specific concerns raised by Alanna, such as allocating clear responsibilities, setting up regular check-ins, and establishing open lines of communication.

If the meeting with Alanna does not yield the desired outcome, I would explore alternative collaboration options within RHA, such as engaging with other members or committees who may be more receptive to working with student government. I would also consider adjusting the event planning strategy to ensure that the fair can still be successful, even if the collaboration with RHA is limited.

Throughout this process, I would prioritize transparency, honesty, and respect for all parties involved, aiming to find a solution that benefits the student body and upholds the positive relationship between student government and RHA.
