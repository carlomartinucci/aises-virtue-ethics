In Josh's position, I would schedule a one-on-one meeting with Alanna to address the issues surrounding the collaboration for the upcoming fair. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about the lack of communication and collaboration between our organizations and the potential impact it could have on the event. I would actively listen to Alanna's perspective and try to understand her reservations and concerns.

To build trust and foster a positive relationship, I would propose a compromise where we outline clear responsibilities and timelines for both organizations to ensure the event's success. I would emphasize the importance of working together to maintain the positive collaboration that has benefited both student government and RHA in the past.

If Alanna remains uncooperative or hesitant, I would suggest involving both advisors in a joint meeting to mediate the discussion and help find a mutually agreeable solution. This collaborative approach would demonstrate a commitment to working together and finding common ground for the benefit of the student body.

Additionally, I would start working on a contingency plan in parallel to ensure that the event can still be organized effectively if the collaboration with RHA does not work out. This proactive approach would help mitigate any potential risks and ensure that the event is a success, regardless of the outcome of the collaboration with RHA.
