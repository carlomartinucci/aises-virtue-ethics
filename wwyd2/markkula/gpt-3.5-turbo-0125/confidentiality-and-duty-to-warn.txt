I would address the client's expressed desire to stalk Susan and her new boyfriend by discussing the potential consequences of such actions, emphasizing the importance of respecting boundaries and privacy. I would work with the client to explore the underlying feelings of rejection and jealousy, helping him develop healthier coping strategies. Additionally, I would assess the client's risk of harm to himself or others and consider involving a support group or mental health professional to provide ongoing support and monitoring.
