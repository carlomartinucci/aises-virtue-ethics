I would schedule a follow-up session with the client to further explore his feelings of rejection and inadequacy related to Susan's new relationship. During this session, I would use cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques to help the client challenge and reframe his thoughts about the situation. I would also work with the client to develop a personalized coping plan that includes identifying triggers for his jealousy and rejection, as well as implementing healthy coping strategies such as mindfulness exercises or journaling. Additionally, I would involve the client's support system, such as family or friends, in the therapy process to provide additional support and accountability.
