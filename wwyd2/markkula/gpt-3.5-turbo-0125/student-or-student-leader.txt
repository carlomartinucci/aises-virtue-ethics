To address the conflict of senators missing Senate meetings due to class schedules, I would take the following steps:

1. Meet with the senior senator who must take the class to graduate and discuss potential alternatives to ensure their academic success while fulfilling their Senate responsibilities. This could involve exploring options such as adjusting the class schedule, seeking permission for occasional absences, or delegating specific tasks to other Senate members.

2. Work with the junior senator to identify a proxy who can attend Senate meetings on their behalf. Establish clear guidelines for the proxy's role, responsibilities, and reporting mechanisms to ensure effective representation of the constituents' concerns.

3. Propose a temporary amendment to the attendance policy to allow for exceptions in cases where senators have unavoidable academic conflicts. Present this proposal to the Senate for discussion and approval, emphasizing the importance of supporting members' academic pursuits while maintaining the organization's functionality.

By implementing these steps, we can address the senators' class schedule conflicts in a practical and ethical manner, ensuring that both academic and organizational commitments are met effectively.
