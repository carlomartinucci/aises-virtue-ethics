To address the issue of the two senators missing Senate meetings due to class schedules, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Implement a Rotating Proxy System:
- Establish a rotating proxy system where each absent senator selects a proxy from within the Senate to represent them at meetings.
- Ensure that the selected proxies receive detailed briefings from the absent senators before each meeting to accurately convey their perspectives and priorities.
- Rotate the proxy responsibilities among Senate members to distribute the workload and provide opportunities for different members to engage in the decision-making process.

By implementing a rotating proxy system, we can ensure that the concerns of constituents are represented in Senate meetings while also fostering collaboration and shared responsibility among Senate members. This approach addresses the potential drawbacks of the previous solution by involving multiple members in the representation process and minimizing the risk of misrepresentation.
