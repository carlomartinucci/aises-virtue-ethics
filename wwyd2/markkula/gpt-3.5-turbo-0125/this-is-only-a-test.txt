I would immediately convene a task force consisting of representatives from the IT department, academic staff, and student body to conduct a thorough review of the proctoring software currently in use. This review would specifically focus on identifying any biases in the face detection algorithms and other potential discriminatory features. The task force would be responsible for analyzing the software's impact on students and proposing necessary changes to address any identified issues.

Following the review, I would collaborate with the IT department to implement adjustments to the software to mitigate biases and ensure fairness in exam monitoring. This may involve updating algorithms, modifying settings, or exploring alternative proctoring solutions that prioritize ethical considerations and student well-being.

To ensure ongoing monitoring and evaluation, I would establish a student advisory group dedicated to providing feedback on the use of proctoring software. This group would meet regularly to discuss any concerns, suggest improvements, and advocate for student interests in decision-making processes related to exam monitoring.

In parallel, I would research and recommend alternative exam monitoring methods that align with ethical standards and prioritize student welfare. This could include exploring options such as open-book exams, project-based assessments, or remote proctoring services that uphold fairness and privacy.

By taking these concrete steps, we can address the ethical concerns surrounding the use of proctoring software in online exams, promote transparency in decision-making, and ensure that our approach to exam monitoring prioritizes the well-being and academic integrity of our students.
