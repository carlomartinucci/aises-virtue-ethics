To address Derek's situation more effectively, I would recommend the following concrete actions:

1. **Engage in Direct Communication:** Derek should schedule a meeting with the Vice Provost to discuss the recent incidents involving off-campus Greek life. During the meeting, he should present the concerns of the affected students in a clear and respectful manner, emphasizing the importance of addressing these issues to maintain student trust in the Associated Students. By directly communicating the students' experiences and needs, Derek can advocate for their interests while fostering understanding with the administration.

2. **Propose a Compromise:** Derek could suggest a compromise solution that addresses the concerns of off-campus Greek life organizations while aligning with the administration's goals. For example, he could propose organizing a campus-wide forum specifically focused on campus safety and security, which would encompass the issues faced by off-campus Greek life without explicitly discussing Greek life recognition. This approach allows Derek to address the students' concerns while respecting the administration's stance on the matter.

By taking these specific actions, Derek can navigate the challenges of representing student interests authentically while maintaining a positive relationship with the administration. Direct communication with the Vice Provost and proposing a compromise solution demonstrate Derek's commitment to advocating for student needs while seeking constructive dialogue and collaboration with the administration.
