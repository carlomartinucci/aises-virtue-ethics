I would advise Derek to leverage the power of data and evidence to support the concerns of the students regarding the targeted thefts affecting off-campus fraternities and sororities. Derek could conduct a survey or gather testimonials from students who have been directly impacted by these incidents. By collecting concrete data and personal accounts, Derek can present a compelling case to the Vice Provost, highlighting the real and urgent nature of the issue.

Additionally, Derek could collaborate with other student government leaders and organizations to amplify the voices of the students and demonstrate a unified front in addressing the issue. By working together with a coalition of student groups, Derek can show the Vice Provost that the concerns regarding off-campus Greek life are widespread and significant to the student body as a whole.

Furthermore, Derek could explore alternative channels of communication with the Vice Provost, such as requesting a private meeting to discuss the specific concerns related to Greek life. In this meeting, Derek can present the data and testimonials gathered, emphasizing the importance of addressing these issues for the well-being and safety of the student community.

Overall, by utilizing data-driven evidence, collaborating with student groups, and seeking direct communication with the Vice Provost, Derek can navigate the complexities of the situation while advocating for the authentic concerns of the students.
