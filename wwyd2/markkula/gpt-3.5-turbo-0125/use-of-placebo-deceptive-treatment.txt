I would schedule an urgent appointment with the patient to address his concerns about contracting syphilis. During the appointment, I would review his medical records with him to show the negative test results for syphilis and other STDs. I would then explain the medical evidence and reassure him that he does not have syphilis.

To address his volatility, I would introduce a coping strategy called "grounding techniques" to help him manage his emotions. I would teach him techniques such as deep breathing exercises and mindfulness practices to use when he feels overwhelmed or anxious.

Additionally, I would involve a social worker in the treatment team to provide additional support. The social worker could work with the patient on cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques to challenge and reframe his beliefs about contracting syphilis.

Finally, I would emphasize the importance of ongoing monitoring and follow-up to ensure that the patient remains engaged with treatment. I would schedule regular check-ins to address any new concerns or challenges that may arise and to provide continuous support for his well-being.
