In this scenario, I would propose implementing a new policy that requires all members of the funding committee to disclose any potential conflicts of interest, including leadership roles in clubs that are seeking funding. This disclosure would be made prior to any discussion or decision-making related to funding requests. Additionally, I would suggest creating a subcommittee within the funding committee specifically tasked with reviewing and making decisions on funding requests from clubs where a conflict of interest exists for any committee member.

To address the issue of potential bias and ensure fairness, I would recommend that Garret recuse himself from any discussions or decisions related to funding requests submitted by his club. This would help mitigate any perceived favoritism and uphold the integrity of the funding process. Furthermore, I would encourage open communication with Garret and the rest of the committee members to explain the rationale behind these measures and emphasize the importance of maintaining impartiality in funding decisions.

By implementing these specific actions, we can enhance transparency, mitigate conflicts of interest, and promote fairness in the allocation of funds to campus organizations. This approach aims to address the ethical concerns raised in the scenario while also fostering a collaborative and equitable decision-making process within the student government committee.
