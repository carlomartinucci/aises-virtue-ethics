To address potential resistance to the new policies from Garret and other committee members, Claire should schedule individual meetings with each member to discuss the rationale behind the changes and address any concerns they may have. By engaging in open dialogue and actively listening to their perspectives, Claire can build understanding and support for the policy changes. Additionally, Claire should emphasize the importance of upholding the integrity of the funding process and ensuring fairness for all clubs on campus.

In order to proactively anticipate challenges, Claire should establish a system for anonymous feedback from committee members to encourage open communication and address any issues that may arise. This feedback mechanism can help identify any unintended consequences of the new policies and allow for adjustments to be made as needed.

Furthermore, Claire should implement a regular review process to evaluate the effectiveness of the new policies in promoting fairness and transparency in the funding allocation process. By collecting data on funding decisions and monitoring the impact of the changes over time, Claire can make informed decisions on potential adjustments or improvements to the policies.

Overall, by engaging in open communication, addressing concerns proactively, and implementing mechanisms for feedback and evaluation, Claire can navigate the ethical challenges posed by the conflict of interest within the student government funding committee in a practical and effective manner.
