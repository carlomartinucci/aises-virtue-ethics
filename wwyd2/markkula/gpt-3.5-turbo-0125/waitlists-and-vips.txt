To address the scenario while considering the potential impact on Callie's personal relationships, I would take the following steps:

1. Rectify the errors in data entry and confirm the availability of five remaining tickets for Senior Ball.
2. Reach out to the senior class through a brief email explaining the situation and expressing the need for a fair and inclusive ticket distribution process.
3. Create a simple online form where interested seniors can submit their names for a lottery to win the remaining tickets.
4. Include a section in the form where students can share a brief statement about why they would like to attend Senior Ball.
5. Randomly select five names from the pool of interested seniors who submitted the form, ensuring transparency and fairness in the selection process.
6. Communicate the results to the senior class, emphasizing the random selection method used to allocate the tickets.
7. Encourage those who did not receive tickets to still participate in other senior events and activities leading up to graduation.

By implementing a transparent lottery system and considering the personal relationships involved, this approach aims to maintain fairness, inclusivity, and integrity in the ticket distribution process while also acknowledging the importance of Callie's friendships and the overall senior class community.
