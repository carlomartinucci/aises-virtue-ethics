I would initiate a direct conversation between Google and Microsoft's security teams to discuss the vulnerabilities found and the disclosure policies in place. During this meeting, I would propose establishing a joint task force comprising members from both companies to collaboratively assess and address the vulnerabilities. This task force would work together to prioritize the vulnerabilities, develop patches, and establish a coordinated disclosure plan.

To ensure user safety during the disclosure process, I would recommend implementing an immediate temporary mitigation strategy for the vulnerabilities until the patches are ready for release. This strategy could involve providing users with specific security recommendations or workarounds to minimize the risks associated with the vulnerabilities.

Furthermore, I would suggest engaging an independent cybersecurity firm to conduct a thorough assessment of the vulnerabilities and provide expert guidance on the development of effective patches. This external expertise would help validate the severity of the vulnerabilities and ensure that the patches are robust and comprehensive.

By fostering collaboration, implementing temporary mitigation measures, and leveraging external expertise, we can work towards a more coordinated and effective approach to addressing software vulnerabilities. This proactive and collaborative effort would prioritize user safety, promote transparency, and facilitate a more ethical and practical resolution to the conflict between Google and Microsoft.
