To address the concerns raised by Kyle's parents regarding social interaction opportunities at Eminent Scholars, I would propose the following concrete actions:

1. Implement a Buddy System: Pair Kyle with a peer mentor at Eminent Scholars who can support him in developing social skills, fostering communication, and encouraging teamwork. The peer mentor can engage in joint activities, projects, and social interactions with Kyle to provide a structured opportunity for social growth.

By assigning a peer mentor to Kyle, we can create a supportive environment for him to practice social skills in a one-to-one setting while still benefiting from personalized education. This approach ensures that Kyle receives individualized support tailored to his needs while also promoting social interaction and collaboration with a peer.

Additionally, I would schedule regular meetings with Kyle, his parents, and the peer mentor to discuss progress, set goals, and address any concerns. This ongoing communication and feedback loop will allow us to monitor Kyle's social development, make necessary adjustments, and ensure that he is receiving the support he needs to thrive both academically and socially at Eminent Scholars.
