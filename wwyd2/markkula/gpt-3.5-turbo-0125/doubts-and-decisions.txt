In Leah's position, I would express my gratitude to the President and Vice President for offering me the Director of Marketing position. I would then request a meeting with them to discuss my interests in exploring other areas within the organization, such as leadership development, community service, or women's affairs. During the meeting, I would propose a plan to take on additional responsibilities in these areas while fulfilling my duties in marketing. This could involve collaborating with the current directors in those areas to support their initiatives, attending relevant meetings, and contributing ideas for new projects.

I would also reach out to my friend who wanted the marketing position and have an honest conversation with her about my decision. I would explain my reasons for accepting the role and reassure her of my continued support and collaboration. I would offer to work closely with her on marketing projects and seek her input on how we can enhance the organization's marketing efforts together.

Furthermore, I would actively seek out opportunities to showcase my graphic design skills and creativity in the marketing role, while also demonstrating my leadership potential by taking on additional responsibilities in other areas of interest. By balancing my commitments and actively contributing to various aspects of the organization, I can continue to pursue my long-term goal of running for President while making a positive impact within the organization.
