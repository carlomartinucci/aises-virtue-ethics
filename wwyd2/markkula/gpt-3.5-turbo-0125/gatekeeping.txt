To address the concerns raised by faculty members and students regarding email communication, I would implement the following steps:

1. Create a separate email list specifically for faculty announcements: By establishing a dedicated email list for faculty members to share essential information with students, we can ensure that their messages reach the intended audience without overwhelming the existing student events email list.

2. Limit the frequency of faculty emails: To prevent email overload, I would set guidelines for faculty members regarding the frequency of their communications to students. This could include a maximum number of emails per week or a specific day designated for faculty announcements.

3. Implement a student feedback survey: To gauge student satisfaction and preferences regarding email communication, I would create a brief survey to gather feedback on the content, frequency, and relevance of the emails they receive. This feedback would help inform future decisions on email communication strategies.

4. Communicate the changes transparently: I would clearly communicate the establishment of the new faculty email list, the guidelines for faculty communications, and the student feedback survey to all stakeholders involved. Transparency is key to ensuring understanding and buy-in from both faculty members and students.

By taking these specific actions, we can address the concerns raised by faculty members while also prioritizing student satisfaction and engagement with email communication. This approach aims to strike a balance between the needs of all parties involved and promote effective communication within the student government.
