I would suggest implementing a system where faculty members can submit their essential information to the student government for inclusion in the weekly email newsletter. This way, faculty members can still share important updates with students without overwhelming the existing email list. The student government can review and select the most critical information to include in the newsletter, ensuring that students receive valuable updates without being bombarded with additional emails. This approach would streamline communication, maintain the integrity of the current system, and alleviate the burden on both students and faculty members.
