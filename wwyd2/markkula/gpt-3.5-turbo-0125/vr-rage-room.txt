To further enhance the ethical standards within the VR Rage Room app, I would implement an AI-driven content moderation system that scans user-uploaded scenarios for any potential violations of the terms of service. This system would use algorithms to flag and review scenarios that depict violence towards humans, ensuring that such content is promptly removed from the platform. By proactively monitoring user-generated content, we can prevent inappropriate scenarios from being published and maintain a safe and responsible environment for all users.
