To address the points raised in the critique and provide a more ethically sound and practical response, I would implement the following action:

Implement AI Content Moderation: I would integrate artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms into the VR Rage Room app to proactively monitor and filter out potentially inappropriate content. The AI system would scan uploaded rooms, objects, and scenarios for any signs of violence towards humans, ensuring that such content is automatically flagged for review.

By leveraging AI content moderation, the app can preemptively identify and remove problematic content, reducing the likelihood of users encountering inappropriate scenarios. This proactive approach not only aligns with ethical standards but also enhances user safety and satisfaction within the app.

Integrating AI content moderation complements the existing reporting system by providing an additional layer of protection against violations of the app's terms of service. This action demonstrates a commitment to upholding ethical standards and creating a responsible user community within the VR Rage Room app.
