I would recommend that Elena have a conversation with Jack to discuss the potential harm and misinformation in his article. During this conversation, Elena should provide Jack with specific data and evidence from the university's Admissions Office that clarifies the actual admission process and the absence of affirmative action policies. This will help Jack understand the factual inaccuracies in his piece and the importance of ensuring accuracy in his arguments.

Additionally, Elena should work with Jack to revise the article to reflect the correct information about the university's admission process. She can guide Jack in incorporating a more balanced perspective that considers the implications of his arguments and presents a fair representation of the issue. By collaborating on the revision, Elena can uphold journalistic integrity while also promoting a more informed and accurate discussion on affirmative action.

To address potential accusations of limiting freedom of speech or political bias, Elena should explain to Jack the ethical responsibility of journalists to provide accurate information to the public. She can emphasize the importance of upholding journalistic standards and avoiding the spread of misinformation, even in opinion pieces. By framing the decision not to publish or edit Jack's article as a commitment to truth and accuracy, Elena can navigate potential criticisms while maintaining the integrity of the publication.
