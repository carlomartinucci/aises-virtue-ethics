I would recommend that Elena have a conversation with Jack to discuss the inaccuracies in his article regarding the university's affirmative action policies. During this conversation, Elena should clearly explain to Jack that the university does not practice affirmative action in its admission process. She should emphasize the importance of factual accuracy in journalism and the potential harm that misinformation can cause. Elena should then offer Jack the opportunity to revise his article to accurately reflect the university's admission process. By guiding Jack towards a more accurate representation of the issue and encouraging him to present a more balanced perspective, Elena can uphold journalistic integrity while also promoting a more inclusive and informed debate in the publication.
