To address the ethical concerns surrounding the Diversity in Faces (DiF) dataset created by IBM Research, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Immediately halt any further distribution of the DiF dataset to prevent additional privacy violations.
2. Launch a dedicated online portal where individuals can easily search for their photos in the dataset and request their removal.
3. Engage with a privacy law expert to develop a robust consent process for obtaining permission from individuals whose images are included in AI datasets.
4. Conduct a comprehensive audit of all datasets used by IBM Research to ensure compliance with ethical standards and data privacy regulations.
5. Enhance transparency by publishing a detailed report outlining the methodology used to create the DiF dataset and the steps taken to address privacy concerns.
6. Implement mandatory training sessions for all researchers and data scientists on ethical considerations in data collection and usage for AI projects.

These actions aim to address the immediate ethical concerns raised by the creation and distribution of the DiF dataset while establishing a framework for ethical data practices in future AI research projects.
