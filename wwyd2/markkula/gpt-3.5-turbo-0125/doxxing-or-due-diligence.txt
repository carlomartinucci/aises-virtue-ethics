I would advise Andres to respect the student's request for anonymity in the article. However, I would suggest that Andres reach out to the student again to discuss the potential consequences of his actions and the importance of taking responsibility for his public statements. By having a follow-up conversation, Andres can encourage the student to consider the impact of his words and actions while still honoring his wish for confidentiality. This approach allows for a more nuanced exploration of the ethical considerations involved and promotes a dialogue about accountability and the consequences of public discourse.
