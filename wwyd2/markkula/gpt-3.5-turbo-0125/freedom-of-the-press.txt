To address the scenario more effectively, Carrie should take the following specific actions:

1. Conduct Student Interviews: Carrie should conduct structured interviews with a diverse group of students to gather their perspectives on the new statue. She should ask open-ended questions to understand the reasons behind the jokes and criticisms, as well as any positive aspects they may see in the statue.

By focusing on gathering a comprehensive range of student opinions through interviews, Carrie can ensure that the video reflects a balanced view of the topic while also providing valuable insights into the student body's sentiments. This approach will help her create a more nuanced and authentic representation of the conversation surrounding the statue on campus.
