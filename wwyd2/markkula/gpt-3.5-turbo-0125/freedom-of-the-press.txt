Carrie should include the topic of the new statue in her video about trending conversation topics among students on campus. To address potential concerns from the university administration, she can present the topic objectively by showcasing a variety of student perspectives through interviews. Carrie should emphasize the importance of open dialogue and transparency in reflecting student sentiment.

In addition, Carrie can proactively engage with university administration by sharing a draft of the video for feedback and discussing the rationale behind including the statue topic. By demonstrating a willingness to collaborate and address any potential issues upfront, Carrie can navigate the situation ethically while staying true to her role as a representative of the student body.
