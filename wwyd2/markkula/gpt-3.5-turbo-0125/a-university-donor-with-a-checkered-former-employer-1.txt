I would thank the donor for their interest in supporting the university and express gratitude for their willingness to give back to the community. I would kindly request more information from the donor about their specific role and involvement during their time at the financial group to better understand their perspective and intentions.

After gathering more details, I would consult with the university's fundraising team and leadership to discuss the situation. I would propose conducting due diligence on the donor's background to verify their level of involvement in the controversial practices of the financial group. This due diligence process may involve researching public records, news articles, and any available information to assess the donor's connection to the unethical practices.

Given the university's commitment to diversifying STEM fields and supporting underrepresented groups, I would also consider the potential impact of accepting the donation on these efforts. If the due diligence process reveals minimal or non-existent involvement of the donor in the unethical practices and their values align with the university's mission, we may consider accepting the donation. However, if there are significant concerns about the donor's past actions or values conflicting with the university's commitment to diversity and inclusion, we may respectfully decline the donation.

Throughout the process, clear and transparent communication with the donor is crucial. I would ensure that the donor is informed of the decision-making process and the reasons behind the final decision, maintaining professionalism and respect in all interactions.
