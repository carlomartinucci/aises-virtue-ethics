I would thank the donor for their interest in supporting the university and express gratitude for their willingness to give back to the community. I would schedule a meeting with the donor to discuss their background and involvement during their time at the financial group. During the meeting, I would ask specific questions to understand the donor's role in the organization and their knowledge of the predatory lending practices.

Following the meeting, I would conduct thorough research on the donor's history at the financial group, including reviewing any available public information and news articles related to their tenure. I would also consult with the university's ethics committee to evaluate the potential implications of accepting donations from the donor.

Based on the information gathered and the advice received, I would have a transparent conversation with the donor. I would explain the university's commitment to ethical fundraising practices and the importance of ensuring that donations align with the university's values. Depending on the outcome of the due diligence process and discussions with the ethics committee, I would make a decision on whether to accept the donation and establish clear conditions, if applicable.

Throughout the process, I would prioritize transparency, integrity, and ethical considerations to ensure that the university upholds its values while also considering the potential impact of accepting donations from the donor associated with the financial group's controversial past.
