Dave should immediately cease the illegal arrangement with Alex and inform the leadership of his organization about the illegal currency exchange activities of the non-profit in the Dominican Republic. He should gather evidence of the illegal transactions and present it to the appropriate authorities for investigation. Dave should also seek legal advice to understand the potential consequences of his actions and how to protect himself and others involved. Additionally, he should undergo training on ethical practices in international development to prevent similar situations in the future. Finally, Dave should work with his organization to establish a transparent and legal method for exchanging donor funds to support the housing project for the unhoused individuals.
