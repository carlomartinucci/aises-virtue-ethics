I would advise Dave to take the following specific actions:

1. Immediately cease the illegal arrangement with Alex and explain to him the reasons for discontinuing the exchange of funds.
2. Document all the details of the illegal currency exchange activities of the non-profit, including dates, amounts, and individuals involved.
3. Report the illegal activities to the local authorities in the Dominican Republic, providing the documented evidence to support the claim.
4. Engage with his organization's leadership to discuss the situation and seek guidance on how to proceed in a way that upholds ethical standards and legal requirements.
5. Collaborate with the organization to establish a transparent and legitimate method for funding the housing project, ensuring compliance with local laws and regulations.

By taking these specific actions, Dave can address the ethical implications of the situation effectively, uphold legal standards, and work towards finding a sustainable and ethical solution for continuing the housing project for the unhoused individuals in the Dominican Republic.
