To address the potential biases that may arise from Saumya's personal relationships with her friends, I would take the following steps:

1. Conduct a thorough review of the remaining candidates' applications to identify any potential strengths or areas for improvement that could make them suitable for the committee roles.
   
2. Organize a meeting with each of the remaining candidates to discuss the specific requirements and expectations of the committee roles. During these meetings, I would provide guidance on how they can enhance their skills or knowledge to better align with the committee's needs.

3. If after the review and meetings, I still feel that the remaining candidates may not be the best fit for the committees, I would consider reaching out to my friends who I believe would be strong candidates for the positions.

4. When approaching my friends, I would clearly communicate the importance of fairness and transparency in the selection process. I would encourage them to apply formally and go through the same evaluation process as the other candidates.

5. To ensure objectivity in the selection process, I would involve other members of the student government or faculty advisors in the final decision-making process. This would help in providing diverse perspectives and minimizing the influence of personal biases.

By following these steps, I aim to balance the need for finding the best candidates for the committee roles while upholding fairness and transparency in the selection process.
