To address the ethical dilemma in the scenario, James should prioritize fairness and equal opportunity in his campaign strategy. Instead of renting luxury cars to drive students to classes on Election Day, James could allocate those funds towards organizing a campus-wide voter engagement event. This event could include interactive activities, informational sessions about the candidates' platforms, and opportunities for students to ask questions and engage with the candidates directly. By focusing on engaging with the student body in a meaningful way, James can demonstrate his commitment to ethical campaigning practices and create a more level playing field for all candidates.

Additionally, James should reach out to Alix to propose a joint initiative aimed at promoting voter participation and awareness. By collaborating on a project that benefits the entire student body, James and Alix can showcase their leadership skills and dedication to serving the student community. This collaborative effort not only fosters a spirit of cooperation and unity but also sets a positive example for future campaigns, emphasizing the values of fairness and integrity in student government elections.

By implementing these specific actions, James can ensure that his campaign is conducted ethically and with a focus on inclusivity and fairness, ultimately contributing to a more positive and constructive election process.
