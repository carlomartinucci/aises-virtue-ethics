To address the ethical dilemma in the scenario, James should consider collaborating with Alix on joint campaign efforts that benefit both candidates and promote fairness in the election process. Specifically, James could propose a joint fundraising event where they pool their resources to fund shared marketing initiatives that benefit both campaigns equally. This collaborative approach not only helps level the playing field but also fosters a spirit of cooperation and unity among the candidates.

Additionally, James could offer to share his campaign resources, such as advertising space or campaign materials, with Alix to ensure that both candidates have equal opportunities to reach voters. By working together and supporting each other's campaigns, James and Alix can demonstrate a commitment to fairness and integrity in the election process while still running effective campaigns based on their individual strengths and platforms.
