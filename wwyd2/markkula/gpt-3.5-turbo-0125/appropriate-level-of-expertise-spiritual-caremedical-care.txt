I would schedule an urgent meeting with John to discuss his recent struggles and the concerning behaviors he has shared with me. During the meeting, I would express my deep concern for his well-being and emphasize the importance of seeking professional help. I would offer to assist him in finding a mental health professional or a substance abuse counselor and provide support in making an appointment. If John continues to refuse professional help, I would contact a mental health hotline or emergency services to ensure his immediate safety. Additionally, I would explore alternative options for support, such as connecting him with community resources or support groups outside the church. I would continue to offer spiritual guidance and prayer while encouraging John to prioritize his physical and mental health.
