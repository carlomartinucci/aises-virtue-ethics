In response to John's situation, I would schedule a private meeting with him to express my deep concern about his well-being. During this meeting, I would emphasize the urgency of seeking professional help and offer to assist him in finding a mental health professional or substance abuse counselor. I would provide him with specific recommendations for healthcare providers in the area who specialize in depression and addiction.

Additionally, I would reach out to other church members who have experience in mental health or addiction counseling to provide additional support and resources for John. I would encourage John to attend a support group meeting, such as the church's Alcoholics Anonymous chapter, and offer to accompany him for added support.

If John continues to refuse professional help or support group meetings, I would explore alternative options such as connecting him with a peer support group or online resources for individuals struggling with depression and addiction. I would continue to follow up with John regularly to ensure he is taking steps towards getting the help he needs and offer ongoing support and encouragement.
