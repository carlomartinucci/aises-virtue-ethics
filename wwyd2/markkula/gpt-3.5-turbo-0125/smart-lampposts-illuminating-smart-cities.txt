I would immediately convene a meeting with cybersecurity experts to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the smart lamppost project in Hong Kong. This assessment would focus on identifying potential vulnerabilities in the system that could lead to data leaks or unauthorized access. Based on the findings, I would work with the company responsible for the project to implement robust encryption protocols and access controls to safeguard the data collected by the smart lampposts.

In parallel, I would organize a series of town hall meetings and public consultations to address the privacy concerns of the community. These forums would provide a platform for residents to voice their opinions, ask questions, and express their concerns regarding surveillance capabilities and data privacy. By fostering open dialogue and transparency, we can build trust with the public and demonstrate our commitment to protecting their privacy.

To ensure ongoing compliance with data protection regulations, I would establish regular security audits to monitor the effectiveness of the security measures put in place. Additionally, I would develop clear guidelines on data usage and storage, outlining how the collected data will be used, who will have access to it, and how long it will be retained. By proactively addressing privacy concerns and implementing stringent security measures, we can mitigate risks and uphold ethical standards in the deployment of smart city technologies.
