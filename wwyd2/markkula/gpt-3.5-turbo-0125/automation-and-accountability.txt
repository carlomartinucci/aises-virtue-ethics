To address the issue of the faulty MiDAS system and its impact on Michigan residents, I would take the following specific action:

1. **Advocate for Legislative Changes**: I would work with local lawmakers and advocacy groups to push for legislative changes that mandate human oversight in the implementation of automated systems like MiDAS. By advocating for laws that require transparency, accountability, and regular audits of such systems, we can prevent similar incidents of algorithmic errors leading to wrongful accusations in the future. This proactive approach aims to address the root cause of the problem by ensuring that automated tools are designed and implemented with human supervision to prevent unjust outcomes for individuals relying on government programs.
