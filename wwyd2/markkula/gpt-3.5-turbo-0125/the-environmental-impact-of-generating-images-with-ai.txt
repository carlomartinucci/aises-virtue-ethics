I would collaborate with generative AI tool developers to implement a feature that provides users with real-time feedback on the energy consumption and environmental impact of their image generation activities. This feature would display metrics such as the amount of energy used, carbon emissions produced, and water consumption associated with each image generated. By making this information transparent and easily accessible to users, they can make more informed decisions about their usage and potentially reduce their environmental footprint.
