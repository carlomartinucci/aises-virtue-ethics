To address the concerns raised in the critique and provide a more practical response, Jessica could take the following specific action:

1. **Seek Corroboration from Trusted Sources**: Jessica can reach out to the university's legal aid office or a faculty member who works closely with undocumented students. By verifying Adam's story through a trusted institutional source, Jessica can add credibility to the article without compromising Adam's anonymity. This step not only strengthens the validity of the testimonial but also helps to address potential doubts about the use of an anonymous source.

By focusing on seeking corroboration from trusted sources, Jessica can navigate the ethical dilemma of including Adam's testimonial in her article while upholding journalistic integrity and protecting his safety.
