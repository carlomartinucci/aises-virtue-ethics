To address the ethical dilemma faced by Talia, I would prioritize representing the interests of her constituency while also considering the concerns raised by the university administration. I would schedule a meeting with the student body to discuss the smoking ban issue and gather their feedback on the potential implications of the ban. This would involve presenting both the student body's overwhelming support for the ban and the administration's concerns about potential legal issues.

During the meeting, I would facilitate an open dialogue to ensure that all perspectives are heard and understood. I would emphasize the importance of balancing the desire for a smoke-free campus with the need to address legal and rights-related concerns. Additionally, I would propose the idea of forming a student-led task force to further explore alternative solutions that could address both the public health concerns and the potential legal implications of the ban.

By involving the student body in the decision-making process and actively seeking their input, I aim to ensure that their voices are heard and their interests are represented. This approach would demonstrate a commitment to ethical decision-making that considers the well-being of the student body while also addressing the concerns raised by the university administration.
