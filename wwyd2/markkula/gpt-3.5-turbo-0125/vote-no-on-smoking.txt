In Talia's position, I would organize a town hall meeting specifically focused on the proposed smoking ban. This would provide an opportunity for students to voice their opinions and concerns directly to both the university administration and their fellow classmates. By facilitating an open dialogue, I could gather more comprehensive feedback from the student body and ensure that their perspectives are taken into account in the decision-making process. Additionally, I would work with the university administration to explore potential compromises that address their legal and logistical concerns while still reflecting the desires of the student body. This collaborative approach would aim to find a solution that balances the health and rights considerations at play, ultimately leading to a more informed and inclusive decision-making process.
