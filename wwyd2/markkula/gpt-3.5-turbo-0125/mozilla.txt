In response to Brendan Eich's resignation as CEO of Mozilla, I would take immediate action to address the concerns raised by employees and the community. I would organize a series of town hall meetings to provide a platform for open dialogue and feedback. During these meetings, I would listen to the perspectives of employees and community members, acknowledging their concerns and committing to transparency moving forward.

To rebuild trust externally, I would launch a public campaign highlighting Mozilla's ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion. This campaign would showcase the organization's support for the LGBTQ+ community and emphasize our dedication to upholding values of openness and equality. Additionally, I would engage with external partners and users through targeted communications to reaffirm our values and strengthen relationships.

Internally, I would establish a task force focused on reviewing and updating our diversity and inclusion policies. This task force would be responsible for implementing unconscious bias training for all employees involved in the hiring process and ensuring that our policies promote a supportive and inclusive environment for all.

By taking these concrete steps to address the fallout from Eich's resignation, I aim to demonstrate Mozilla's unwavering commitment to fostering a culture of respect, diversity, and inclusivity within the organization and in our external relationships.
