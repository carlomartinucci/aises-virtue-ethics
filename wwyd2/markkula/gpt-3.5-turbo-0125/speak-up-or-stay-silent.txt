In addition to scheduling a meeting with his direct supervisor to address the discrepancy in sales reporting, Tre should consider seeking guidance from the company's ethics or compliance officer, if available. This additional step would provide Tre with expert support and resources to navigate the situation effectively and ensure that the issue is addressed in a compliant and ethical manner.

By consulting with the ethics or compliance officer, Tre can gain insights into the company's policies and procedures related to reporting accuracy and potential misconduct. This guidance can help him understand the best course of action to take and ensure that his concerns are addressed through the appropriate channels within the organization.

Furthermore, involving the ethics or compliance officer can also provide Tre with protection against potential retaliation or negative consequences for speaking up about the issue. The officer can offer advice on how to handle the situation professionally and ethically while minimizing risks to Tre's job security.

Overall, seeking guidance from the company's ethics or compliance officer in addition to scheduling a meeting with his supervisor will equip Tre with the necessary support and resources to address the discrepancy in sales reporting effectively and ethically.
