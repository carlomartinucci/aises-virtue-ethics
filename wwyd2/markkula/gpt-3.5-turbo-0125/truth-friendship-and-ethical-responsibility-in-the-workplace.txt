Ben should immediately document all the information he has regarding Michael's fraudulent activities, including any conversations, emails, or transactions that indicate wrongdoing. He should then schedule a meeting with the company's internal investigation team to provide a detailed account of what he knows. During the meeting, Ben should be transparent and forthcoming about the extent of Michael's actions, emphasizing the impact on the company and its stakeholders.

In parallel, Ben should seek guidance from a trusted HR representative within the company to understand the potential implications for his own position and how to protect himself during the investigation process. It is crucial for Ben to prioritize the company's integrity and reputation while also safeguarding his own interests.

By taking proactive steps to address the issue, document his actions, seek guidance, and cooperate fully with the investigation, Ben can demonstrate his commitment to ethical behavior and accountability within the organization.
