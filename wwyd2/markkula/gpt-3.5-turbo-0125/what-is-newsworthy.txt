I would recommend that Fatimah schedule a meeting with her editor and campus safety officials to discuss the implications of tweeting campus safety reports. During the meeting, they should review the specific incident that went viral and consider the potential impact on the individual involved. They should also assess whether sharing such reports aligns with the newspaper's values and journalistic standards. Additionally, they could explore alternative ways to engage students on social media that do not compromise the dignity and privacy of those mentioned in the safety reports. By involving key stakeholders in the decision-making process, they can ensure a more thoughtful and ethical approach to handling campus safety information on social media.
