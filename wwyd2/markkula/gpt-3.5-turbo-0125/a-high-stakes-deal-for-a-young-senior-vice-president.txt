To address the scenario, Tim should firmly refuse the bribe and the altered agreement presented by Sam. He should inform Sam that he cannot proceed with the deal under these circumstances and that he will not compromise his integrity. Tim should then excuse himself from the meeting and immediately contact his boss to schedule an urgent meeting.

During the meeting with his boss, Tim should provide a detailed account of the attempted bribe and the altered agreement. He should explain that he refused the unethical offer and express his commitment to conducting business with honesty and transparency. Tim should request guidance on how to proceed with the deal in a lawful and ethical manner, seeking support from the company's legal department if necessary.

After the meeting, Tim should document the incident, including any interactions with Sam and the details of the altered agreement. He should submit a formal report to the company's ethics committee, outlining the attempted bribery and the steps he took to address the situation. Tim should also seek advice from a trusted colleague or mentor within the company to navigate the potential repercussions of his actions and manage the pressure he is facing.

By taking these specific actions, Tim can uphold his integrity, protect his reputation, and demonstrate his commitment to ethical conduct in a practical and actionable manner.
