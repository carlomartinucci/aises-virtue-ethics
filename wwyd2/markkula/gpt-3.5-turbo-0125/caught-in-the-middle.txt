In Karina's position, I would first schedule a joint meeting between the Senate and the Executive Cabinet to facilitate an open dialogue about the proposed attendance policy. During this meeting, I would encourage each side to share their perspectives and concerns in a respectful and constructive manner.

To address the differing viewpoints on the attendance policy, I would propose a trial period for the implementation of the stricter policy. This trial period would allow both branches to assess the impact of the policy and gather data on its effectiveness in improving Senate performance. At the end of the trial period, a comprehensive review would be conducted to evaluate the policy's outcomes and make informed decisions on whether to maintain, modify, or revoke the policy.

In addition, I would suggest establishing a joint task force comprised of members from both the Senate and the Executive Cabinet to collaboratively develop a revised attendance policy that incorporates elements from both perspectives. This task force would work together to create a policy that balances accountability with flexibility, addressing the concerns raised by both branches.

Furthermore, I would recommend organizing regular joint workshops or training sessions focused on conflict resolution and effective communication strategies to strengthen the relationship between the Senate and the Executive Cabinet. These sessions would provide opportunities for members of both branches to build trust, enhance understanding, and develop skills to navigate disagreements in a constructive manner.

By taking these specific actions, Karina can work towards resolving the conflict between the Senate and the Executive Cabinet while promoting collaboration, transparency, and effective governance within the student government organization.
