To address the conflict between the Senate and the Executive Cabinet in the university's student government, I would prioritize the following specific action:

Facilitate a Structured Dialogue Session: I would organize a structured dialogue session that includes representatives from both the Senate and the Executive Cabinet. This session would be facilitated by a neutral third party skilled in conflict resolution to ensure a productive and respectful discussion. The structured dialogue would provide a platform for each side to express their concerns, perspectives, and underlying interests in a controlled and constructive manner. By setting ground rules for communication, active listening, and mutual understanding, the dialogue session aims to foster empathy, collaboration, and the exploration of common ground. Through this process, the participants can work towards finding a mutually agreeable solution to the conflict regarding the attendance policy.

By focusing on facilitating a structured dialogue session, I aim to promote effective communication, empathy, and collaboration between the Senate and the Executive Cabinet. This approach seeks to address the conflict in a practical, ethical, and inclusive manner, ultimately leading to a resolution that considers the perspectives and interests of all stakeholders involved.
