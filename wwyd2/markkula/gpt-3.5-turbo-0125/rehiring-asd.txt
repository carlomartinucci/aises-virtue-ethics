I would schedule a meeting with Matt to discuss his request for reinstatement and his ASD disclosure. During the meeting, I would address the inappropriate comment he made and clearly communicate the consequences of breaching the company's sexual harassment policy. I would provide him with a written warning outlining the seriousness of the offense and the expectations moving forward.

I would involve HR and legal teams to review the situation and determine if there are accommodations that can be made to support Matt in his role. This could include assigning a mentor to provide guidance and feedback, implementing a communication plan to ensure clarity in expectations, and setting up regular check-ins to monitor his progress and address any challenges that may arise.

I would also prioritize the well-being of the female employee who reported the incident by ensuring she feels supported and safe in the workplace. I would conduct a thorough investigation into the incident, provide her with updates on the actions taken, and offer any necessary support or resources to address any concerns she may have.

Overall, the focus would be on accountability for the inappropriate behavior, providing support and accommodations for Matt due to his ASD, and ensuring a safe and inclusive work environment for all employees.
