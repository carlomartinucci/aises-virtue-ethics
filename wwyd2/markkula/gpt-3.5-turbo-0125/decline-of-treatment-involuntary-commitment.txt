In response to the scenario with Julia, I would take the following specific action:

I would collaborate with the school psychologist and recommend a psychiatric evaluation for Julia to assess her mental health status and determine the most appropriate treatment plan for her major depressive disorder. This evaluation would involve a thorough assessment of her symptoms, history of treatment, and any potential underlying issues contributing to her current state. By involving a psychiatrist, we can ensure that Julia receives specialized care tailored to her needs and preferences, with a focus on effective management of her depression.
