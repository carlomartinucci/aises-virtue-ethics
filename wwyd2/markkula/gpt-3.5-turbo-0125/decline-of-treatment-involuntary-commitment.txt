I would start by acknowledging Julia's concerns and fears regarding treatment for her depression. I would take the time to listen to her experiences and validate her feelings, emphasizing that her well-being is the top priority. I would then explore with Julia the reasons behind her reluctance to consider additional diagnostic tests or treatment options. By understanding her perspective, I can address any misconceptions or fears she may have and work towards building trust and rapport.

To address the immediate concerns about her mental health, I would recommend a consultation with a mental health professional or psychiatrist who specializes in adolescent mental health. I would explain the benefits of seeking specialized care and offer to accompany her to the appointment if she feels more comfortable with support.

In collaboration with Julia, I would develop a safety plan that includes identifying her support system, coping strategies, and emergency contacts. I would provide her with resources for crisis intervention and support services, ensuring she has access to help when needed. I would schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor her progress, adjust the treatment plan as necessary, and continue to offer support and guidance throughout her mental health journey.
