I would start by scheduling a meeting with my student staff to discuss their current workload and gather feedback on how they are managing their responsibilities. During the meeting, I would openly communicate my concerns about potentially overloading them and inquire about their capacity to handle the tasks they have been delegated. 

To address the critical state-level duties related to student financial aid and government funding, I would prioritize these responsibilities and work with my staff to redistribute tasks in a way that ensures these crucial tasks are being adequately addressed. I would identify specific tasks that can be reassigned or streamlined to make room for the state-level advocacy work.

In order to improve efficiency and manage the workload more effectively, I would explore potential strategies such as implementing task management tools, setting clear priorities, and establishing regular check-ins to monitor progress. Additionally, I would consider seeking additional support or resources, such as collaborating with other departments or seeking external assistance, to help alleviate the workload pressure on the student staff.

By taking these concrete steps to address workload distribution, prioritize critical responsibilities, and implement strategies for efficiency, I aim to ensure that both the neighborhood relations work and the state-level advocacy efforts are being effectively managed while also supporting the well-being and capacity of my student staff.
