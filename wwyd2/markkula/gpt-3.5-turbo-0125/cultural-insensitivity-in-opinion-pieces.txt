I would suggest that Jennifer have a direct conversation with Ishmael to discuss the potential cultural insensitivity in his article about boba. During this conversation, Jennifer could explain the cultural significance of boba to many students at their school and express her concerns about the language used in Ishmael's piece. Jennifer could propose that Ishmael revise his article to maintain his critical perspective on boba while avoiding language that could be considered derogatory or offensive towards a particular culture. Specifically, Jennifer could recommend that Ishmael replace the comparison of boba tapioca to "frog eyes rolling in your mouth" with a more neutral description that focuses on taste and texture without invoking potentially offensive imagery. By collaborating with Ishmael on editing his article to ensure cultural sensitivity, Jennifer can help foster a more inclusive dialogue about boba within the school community.
