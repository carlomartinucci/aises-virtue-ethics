In Miguel's situation, I would take the following specific actions to address the conflict of interest and maintain ethical conduct:

1. Recuse myself from any discussions, decisions, or votes within Associated Students related to the outdoor club's petitioning process. By abstaining from these activities, I can ensure that my role in the club does not influence the decision-making process within the student government.

By implementing this measure, I can uphold ethical standards, demonstrate impartiality, and avoid any perception of bias in the evaluation of the outdoor club's petition. This action will help me maintain a reputation as an upright and fair member of Associated Students while supporting the growth of the outdoor club in a responsible and ethical manner.
