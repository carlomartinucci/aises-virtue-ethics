In this scenario, if I were in Miguel's position, I would take a temporary leave of absence from my active role in the outdoor club to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. I would communicate this decision clearly to the club members, emphasizing the importance of maintaining neutrality in my role within Associated Students.

During my absence, I would work closely with the club's leadership to ensure a smooth transition and delegate responsibilities to other members. I would provide guidance and support to the leadership team, offering advice and assistance as needed to help the club continue its operations effectively.

To stay engaged with the club and show my continued support, I would attend meetings as a non-voting member and stay informed about the club's progress. This would allow me to remain connected to the club's activities while upholding ethical standards in my role within Associated Students.

By taking a temporary leave of absence, delegating responsibilities, and staying involved in a supportive capacity, I can navigate the potential conflict of interest ethically and ensure that both roles are fulfilled with integrity and transparency. This approach would allow me to prioritize my duties in student government while supporting the growth of the outdoor club in a responsible and ethical manner.
