Bruce should schedule a meeting with Spencer to discuss his request for an emotional support animal. During the meeting, Bruce should express his support for Spencer's well-being and inquire about the specific needs of the emotional support animal. To address concerns about allergies and phobias, Bruce should conduct a survey among staff and students to assess potential issues and gather relevant information.

Based on the survey results, Bruce should work with HR and legal counsel to determine the feasibility of accommodating Spencer's emotional support animal. They can explore options such as providing a single room for Spencer, setting clear boundaries for the dog's presence in shared spaces, and arranging transportation that minimizes disruptions for others.

Additionally, Bruce should consider implementing a plan to educate staff and students about the presence of the emotional support animal and provide resources for those who may have allergies or fears. By fostering open communication and transparency, Bruce can create a supportive environment that addresses the needs of all individuals involved.

Overall, by taking a collaborative approach, gathering relevant information, and implementing clear guidelines, Bruce can navigate Spencer's request for an emotional support animal in a way that prioritizes well-being while considering the impact on others in the organization.
