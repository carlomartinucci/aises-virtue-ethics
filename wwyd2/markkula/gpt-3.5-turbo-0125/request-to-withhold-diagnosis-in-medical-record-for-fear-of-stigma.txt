I would have a candid discussion with Sophie about the importance of accurately documenting her medical history, including her history of depression, in her medical records. I would explain the potential implications of not disclosing this information, especially in relation to her future medical licensure applications. I would reassure her that seeking help for mental health issues is a positive step and that her well-being should be the top priority.

I would recommend that Sophie pursue therapy in addition to considering antidepressant medication for the management of her depression. I would offer to assist her in finding a therapist who she feels comfortable with and who can provide the support she needs. I would stress the benefits of therapy in addressing the underlying causes of her depression and encourage her to prioritize her mental health.

To address Sophie's concerns about the impact on her medical licensure applications, I would suggest exploring options for confidentially disclosing her history of depression during the application process. I would recommend seeking legal advice on how to navigate this aspect of the licensure process while still prioritizing her mental health needs.

I would work with Sophie to develop a comprehensive plan for ongoing support and follow-up care, including regular check-ins to monitor her progress with therapy and medication. I would ensure that she has access to the resources and support she needs to manage her mental health effectively while also addressing her career aspirations.
