I would schedule a meeting with Sophie to discuss the importance of accurately documenting her medical history, including her history of depression, in her medical records. I would explain the potential consequences of not disclosing this information, particularly in relation to her future medical licensure applications. I would offer to connect her with a healthcare attorney who specializes in medical licensing issues to provide guidance on how to disclose her history of depression in a way that minimizes negative impact on her licensure applications.

In terms of addressing Sophie's mental health, I would recommend a comprehensive treatment plan that includes both medication and therapy. I would assist her in finding a therapist who she feels comfortable with and who can provide the necessary support. I would stress the importance of addressing the underlying issues contributing to her depression through therapy, in addition to considering antidepressant medication.

I would ensure that there is a clear plan for ongoing support and follow-up care for Sophie. This could involve scheduling regular check-ins to monitor her progress, adjusting her treatment plan as needed, and providing a safe space for her to discuss any challenges or concerns that arise during her treatment. I would reassure Sophie that I am committed to supporting her throughout this process and that her well-being is my top priority.
