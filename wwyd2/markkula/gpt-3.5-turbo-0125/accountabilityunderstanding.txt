To address the situation with Jamie, I would schedule a meeting with both Jamie and the other executive council members to discuss the impact of his behavior on the team's effectiveness. During the meeting, I would encourage an open dialogue where everyone can share their perspectives and concerns. This will provide Jamie with a clear understanding of how his actions are affecting the team dynamic and the success of the initiatives.

I would work with Jamie to create a revised plan that takes into account his challenging workload and commitments. This plan may involve redistributing some of Jamie's responsibilities within the council to alleviate some of the pressure on him. Additionally, I would suggest setting up regular check-ins with Jamie to monitor his progress and provide ongoing support.

By involving the other council members in the discussion and adjusting Jamie's responsibilities, we can address the concerns raised by the team while also supporting Jamie in meeting his commitments. This approach fosters a collaborative and supportive environment within the student government, ensuring that all members feel valued and heard.
