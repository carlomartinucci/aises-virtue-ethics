In Marcus's position, I would first schedule individual meetings with each of the opposing candidates and Marcus's campaign supporters who applied for positions in the executive cabinet. During these meetings, I would focus on discussing their motivations, values, and vision for the student government. I would also inquire about their willingness to collaborate with others, set aside personal feelings, and work towards the common goals of the organization.

After the individual meetings, I would organize a team-building retreat for all potential executive cabinet members. This retreat would include team-building activities, group discussions on effective communication and conflict resolution, and goal-setting exercises to align everyone's vision for the organization. It would provide an opportunity for the candidates to interact in a neutral and collaborative environment, fostering trust and unity among the team.

To address the potential resentment from the opposing candidates who were not selected for the executive cabinet, I would follow up with each of them personally. I would express my appreciation for their willingness to serve the organization and offer alternative opportunities for involvement, such as leading specific projects or initiatives within the student government. By acknowledging their contributions and providing avenues for continued engagement, I aim to mitigate any negative feelings and maintain a positive relationship with all candidates.

In making the final decision for the crucial third spot in the executive cabinet, I would prioritize selecting a candidate who not only brings valuable skills and perspectives but also demonstrates a strong commitment to the organization's values and goals. I would consider their ability to work collaboratively with others, their track record of effective teamwork, and their potential to contribute positively to the team dynamic.

By taking these specific actions, I aim to build a cohesive and effective executive cabinet that can lead the student government with unity, integrity, and a shared sense of purpose.
