In addition to declining the settlement offer from the adjacent property owner and continuing to work with my lawyer to present evidence of our firm's lack of responsibility, I would take the following specific action:

I would immediately schedule a meeting with the bank and the building contractor to address their failure to obtain permission for the tiebacks and anchors on the adjacent property. During this meeting, I would stress the importance of following proper procedures and obtaining necessary approvals for all construction activities. I would request a detailed explanation from both parties regarding why the necessary permissions were not obtained and discuss steps to rectify the situation.

By directly addressing the unethical actions of the bank and the contractor, we can work towards ensuring that all parties involved in future projects understand the legal and ethical requirements. This proactive approach will help prevent similar oversights in the future and uphold the integrity of our firm.
