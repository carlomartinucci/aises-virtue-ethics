I would immediately schedule a meeting with the adjacent property owner to discuss the encroachment issue and explore options for resolving the situation amicably. During the meeting, I would present evidence of our firm's communication with the bank regarding the need to obtain permission for the tiebacks and anchors. I would propose de-stressing and abandoning the tiebacks as originally planned to address the encroachment concerns.

Simultaneously, I would engage in negotiations with the adjacent property owner to reach a fair settlement that reflects the inconvenience caused by the encroachment. This could involve offering compensation for the temporary use of the soils beneath their property and any damages incurred. I would ensure that all agreements reached are documented in writing to avoid any misunderstandings in the future.

Furthermore, I would review and enhance our firm's internal protocols to include stricter checks and balances for obtaining permissions and agreements in similar projects. This would involve implementing a thorough review process to verify compliance with all legal requirements and ensuring clear communication with all stakeholders involved in the construction process.

By taking these specific actions, I aim to address the ethical implications of the situation, resolve the dispute with the adjacent property owner, and strengthen our firm's processes to prevent similar issues from arising in the future.
