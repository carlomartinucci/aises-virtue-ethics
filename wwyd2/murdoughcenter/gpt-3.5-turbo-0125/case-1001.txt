To address the formal complaint filed by I. B. Stout against Jonathan Turnbuckle for practicing as an engineer without a license in the state during the clock tower remediation project, Turnbuckle should take the following specific actions:

1. **Obtain a Temporary License**: Immediately upon realizing the need for a license, Turnbuckle should have proactively applied for a temporary engineering license in the state to ensure compliance with local regulations during the project.

By promptly seeking a temporary license, Turnbuckle could have avoided the legal implications of practicing without proper authorization in the state. This proactive approach would have demonstrated a commitment to ethical conduct and regulatory compliance in his engineering practice.
