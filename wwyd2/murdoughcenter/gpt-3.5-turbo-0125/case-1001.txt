Turnbuckle should immediately gather all relevant documentation related to his work on the clock tower remediation project, including his engineering designs, correspondence with stakeholders, and any permits or licenses he held in other states. He should then consult with a local attorney specializing in engineering regulations to understand the specific requirements for practicing as an engineer in the state where the project took place.

Upon receiving the formal complaint from I. B. Stout, Turnbuckle should respond promptly with a detailed explanation of his qualifications, experience, and the circumstances surrounding his involvement in the project. He should provide evidence of his professional engineering registrations in other states and highlight his expertise in ground modification and successful project outcomes.

Turnbuckle should fully cooperate with the state Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors, providing any additional information or documentation they may request to review his case thoroughly. He should demonstrate his commitment to upholding professional standards and ethics in engineering practice throughout the communication process.

In his response to the complaint, Turnbuckle should emphasize the collaborative efforts made to address the structural issues with the clock tower and the successful outcome of the remediation project. He should present a strong case for his actions and decisions during the project, showcasing his expertise and dedication to ensuring the safety and integrity of the structure.

By following these specific steps and demonstrating his qualifications and ethical conduct throughout the process, Turnbuckle can effectively address the complaint and work towards resolving the issue professionally and transparently.
