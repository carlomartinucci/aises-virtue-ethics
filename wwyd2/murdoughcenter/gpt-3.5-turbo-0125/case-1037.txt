I would advise Fulton Adams to discreetly gather evidence of Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert's personal relationship, such as photos or witness statements, to potentially use during the trial. This information could be presented to the legal team representing Wastewater Treatment Systems to strategize on how to challenge Cleghorn's credibility during cross-examination. By focusing on the concrete evidence of their relationship rather than speculation, we can ensure that any actions taken are based on facts and can be effectively used in court. Additionally, I would recommend discussing with legal counsel on the best approach to introduce this evidence ethically and within the confines of the legal system to maintain professionalism and integrity throughout the case.
