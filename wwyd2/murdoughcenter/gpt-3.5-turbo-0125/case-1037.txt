I would immediately inform Fulton Adams about the personal relationship between Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert. I would recommend that Adams discuss this information with the legal team representing Wastewater Treatment Systems to determine the best course of action. One specific action could be to request a meeting with the judge overseeing the case to raise concerns about the potential conflict of interest and request that Cleghorn's role as an expert witness be reevaluated. This proactive approach would aim to ensure a fair trial and uphold the integrity of the legal process.
