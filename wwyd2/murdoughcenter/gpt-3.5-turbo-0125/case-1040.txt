In response to the scenario, Ethan should schedule a meeting with Marc to discuss the unauthorized field changes that have been made. During the meeting, Ethan should present a detailed analysis of the impact of the substitutions on the project's quality and compliance with specifications. He should propose a joint review of the changes with Marc and suggest involving EDOT in the discussion to ensure alignment with the client's expectations.

Ethan should also review the partnership agreement to understand the process for addressing design conflicts and propose an amendment if necessary to include a mechanism for resolving such issues transparently. Seeking legal advice to ensure compliance with contractual obligations and documenting all discussions and decisions related to the field changes are crucial steps to maintain transparency and accountability.

Furthermore, Ethan should communicate clearly with both Marc and EDOT throughout the process, emphasizing the importance of upholding quality standards and the client's trust. By involving all relevant parties in the decision-making process and prioritizing open communication, Ethan can navigate the situation ethically and ensure the project's integrity is preserved.
