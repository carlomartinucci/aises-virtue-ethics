I would immediately schedule a meeting with the University President and the Vice President for Finance to discuss the potential conflicts of interest involving Shreud Contractors, Gus Olson, Ray Vandergrafft, and Fred Facade. During the meeting, I would present the specific details provided by Alice and Ted, highlighting the connections between the construction projects and the individuals involved.

I would recommend conducting a thorough review of the university's contracting processes to ensure transparency and fairness. I would propose implementing stricter oversight mechanisms, such as establishing a committee to review and approve all construction contracts above a certain threshold. This committee would be composed of individuals with diverse backgrounds to ensure impartiality and prevent conflicts of interest.

Furthermore, I would suggest creating a centralized database to track all construction projects, contractors, and payments to enhance transparency and accountability. This database would be regularly audited by an independent third party to ensure compliance with ethical standards and to detect any irregularities or potential conflicts of interest.

In addition, I would offer to assist in developing clear guidelines and protocols for selecting contractors and managing construction projects. These guidelines would include requirements for competitive bidding processes, conflict of interest disclosures, and regular reporting on project progress and expenditures. By establishing clear procedures and promoting a culture of integrity, we can uphold ethical standards and prevent favoritism in the university's construction projects.
