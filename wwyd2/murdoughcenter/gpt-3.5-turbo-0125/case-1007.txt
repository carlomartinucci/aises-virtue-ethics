I would document all the information shared by Alice and Ted regarding the potential conflicts of interest involving Shreud Contractors, Gus Olson, Ray Vandergrafft, and Fred Facade. Following this, I would discreetly reach out to both the University President and the Vice President for Finance, to whom the University Architect reports, to express my concerns about the situation.

During these conversations, I would emphasize the importance of maintaining transparency and fairness in all construction projects at the university. I would suggest conducting an internal review of the contracting processes to ensure they are free from any conflicts of interest or favoritism. Additionally, I would offer to provide any assistance needed in further investigating the matter, such as reviewing project documentation or providing insights based on my architectural expertise.

I would recommend implementing stricter oversight measures, such as involving an external auditing body to review the university's construction projects and ensure compliance with ethical standards. I would also suggest establishing clear guidelines for contractor selection and project approval to prevent similar conflicts of interest from arising in the future.

Following the initial discussions, I would follow up with both the University President and the Vice President for Finance to inquire about any actions taken in response to the information provided. I would continue to monitor the situation closely and offer ongoing support in promoting ethical practices in the university's construction projects.
