Sam should immediately schedule a meeting with all key employees, including Cal, Max, and Mrs. Sliderule, to discuss the current financial challenges facing In-Line Engineering. During this meeting, Sam should propose a collaborative approach to address the situation by forming a task force dedicated to conducting a comprehensive financial review of the company.

The task force should consist of a mix of employees from different departments to ensure diverse perspectives and expertise. Sam should assign specific roles and responsibilities to each team member, outlining clear objectives and timelines for the financial review process.

In parallel, Sam should reach out to industry partners and financial institutions to explore potential financing options or strategic partnerships that could provide the necessary capital to stabilize the business. By leveraging external resources and expertise, In-Line Engineering can access additional funding and support to navigate the current financial challenges.

Furthermore, Sam should prioritize transparency and open communication with all employees throughout the process, ensuring that everyone is informed about the company's financial status and the steps being taken to address it. This approach fosters trust and collaboration among the team, leading to a more sustainable and ethical solution for the business.

By taking these concrete steps, Sam can demonstrate effective leadership, engage employees in problem-solving, and work towards a viable and ethical strategy to secure the future of In-Line Engineering.
