To address the challenges facing In-Line Engineering, Sam should immediately convene a meeting with all key employees, including Cal, Max, and Mrs. Sliderule. During this meeting, Sam should transparently communicate the financial difficulties the company is facing and seek input from each team member on potential solutions.

One specific action Sam should take is to initiate renegotiations with existing clients to adjust payment terms and schedules. By engaging with clients openly and honestly about the company's financial situation, Sam can work towards securing more favorable terms that alleviate immediate cash flow issues without compromising the company's integrity.

Additionally, Sam should explore partnerships with local business development organizations or industry associations to access financial assistance or resources that can support the company during this challenging period. By leveraging external support networks, Sam can strengthen In-Line Engineering's financial stability while upholding ethical standards and maintaining trust with clients and employees.

By taking proactive steps to address the company's financial challenges through transparent communication, renegotiating client contracts, and seeking external support, Sam can navigate the current crisis ethically and sustainably position In-Line Engineering for long-term success.
