I would schedule a meeting with the Vice President for Operations to discuss the budget discrepancies between the Excaliber and Wellfleet projects. During the meeting, I would present a detailed analysis of the financial situation, highlighting the risks associated with overcharging one project to cover the budget shortfall of another. I would propose reallocating resources from other projects to ensure both Excaliber and Wellfleet projects are adequately funded and completed successfully.

Additionally, I would suggest renegotiating the budget for the Wellfleet project with the client to secure additional funds needed to complete the design properly. By addressing the issue directly with the Vice President and proposing practical solutions such as resource reallocation and budget renegotiation, I aim to uphold ethical standards, maintain client trust, and ensure the successful completion of both projects.
