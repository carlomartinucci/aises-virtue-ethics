I would schedule a meeting with the Vice President for Operations to discuss the current situation regarding the billing practices for the Excaliber and Wellfleet projects. During the meeting, I would present a detailed analysis of the budget discrepancies and potential risks associated with overcharging one project to cover the budget shortfall of another. I would propose reallocating resources or renegotiating the budget for the Wellfleet project to ensure both projects are completed successfully and ethically. Additionally, I would suggest implementing a more transparent billing process to maintain the firm's reputation and client trust.
