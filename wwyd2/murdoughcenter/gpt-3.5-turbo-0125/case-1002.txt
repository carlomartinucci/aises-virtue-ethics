As one of the engineers in the Gamma Group Omaha office, I would immediately gather the remaining team members to discuss the impact of Ralph and Dorph's departure. I would suggest creating a detailed transition plan that includes redistributing responsibilities, identifying potential replacements, and outlining strategies to retain clients and attract new business.

To address the sudden loss of key team members, I would propose organizing a meeting with Gamma Group management to express our concerns and seek clarity on the future plans for the office. During this meeting, I would emphasize the importance of maintaining project continuity and client relationships, and request support in filling the vacant positions left by Ralph and Dorph.

Additionally, I would encourage open communication within the team to address any uncertainties or anxieties resulting from the departures. By fostering a supportive and collaborative environment, we can work together to ensure the office's productivity and reputation are upheld during this transition period.

In parallel, I would reach out to existing clients to reassure them of our commitment to their projects and discuss any potential changes in project management. By proactively engaging with clients and demonstrating our dedication to their success, we can mitigate any concerns they may have about the recent developments in the office.

Overall, my approach would focus on practical steps such as creating a transition plan, engaging with management and clients, and fostering team collaboration to navigate the challenges posed by Ralph and Dorph's departure in a professional and ethical manner.
