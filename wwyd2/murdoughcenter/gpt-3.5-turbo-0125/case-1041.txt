Carlos should prioritize the safety and well-being of the workers while also considering the potential consequences of defying his boss's ultimatum. He should immediately implement additional safety measures on the construction site, such as providing safety training and equipment to the Ecuadorian workers. Carlos should also initiate the process of legalizing their employment status to ensure they have access to worker compensation benefits and medical insurance.

In terms of addressing the boss's ultimatum, Carlos should have a candid conversation with his boss about the safety concerns and the importance of ensuring a safe working environment for all workers. He should present a detailed plan outlining the safety measures to be implemented and the steps taken to legalize the workers' employment status. By demonstrating his commitment to ethical practices and worker welfare, Carlos can potentially persuade his boss to prioritize safety over expediency.

Additionally, Carlos should document all safety measures implemented and the communication with his boss regarding the safety concerns. This documentation will not only serve as evidence of his efforts to prioritize safety but also protect him in case of any future conflicts or inquiries.

By taking these specific actions, Carlos can navigate the ethical dilemma effectively, uphold ethical standards, and advocate for the well-being of the workers involved in the project.
