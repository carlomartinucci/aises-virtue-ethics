Carlos should immediately document his safety concerns regarding the use of unqualified workers for the tank construction. He should schedule a meeting with his boss to present a detailed risk assessment report outlining the potential hazards and liabilities associated with the current workforce. During the meeting, Carlos should propose a plan to hire qualified workers to ensure the safe and efficient completion of the project.

In addition, Carlos should contact local labor unions or regulatory bodies to seek guidance on legalizing the employment status of the Ecuadorian workers and providing them with the necessary worker compensation benefits and medical insurance. By taking proactive steps to address these issues, Carlos can demonstrate his commitment to ethical practices and ensure the well-being of all workers involved in the project.

If his boss remains resistant to the proposed changes, Carlos should consider escalating the matter to higher management or seeking legal advice to protect the workers' rights and uphold ethical standards in the workplace. It is crucial for Carlos to prioritize worker safety and legal compliance, even if it means risking his chances of securing a permanent contract with the firm. By advocating for the well-being of the workers and standing firm on his principles, Carlos can uphold ethical values and ensure a safe working environment for all involved.
