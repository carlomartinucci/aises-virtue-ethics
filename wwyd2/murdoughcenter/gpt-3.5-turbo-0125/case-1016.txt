Question 1:
As the President of Nearby Engineers, I would respectfully decline to submit an additional proposal for the project, given that Trueheart Engineers have already been selected by the Public Works staff. I would communicate our decision clearly to the County Public Works Department, emphasizing our commitment to ethical business practices and respect for the integrity of the selection process.

Question 2:
As a professional engineer on the County Public Works Department staff and a member of the interview/selection team, I would document the discrepancies between the announced QBS selection process and the Director of Public Works' decision to hire Nearby Engineers. I would raise my concerns with the department's ethics committee or a higher authority within the organization to address the deviation from the established procedures and ensure transparency in the selection process.

Question 3:
As the Director of Public Works, upon receiving instructions to hire Nearby Engineers regardless of the announced QBS selection procedure, I would request a meeting with the Board of Supervisors to discuss the importance of following the established selection process. I would present the potential ethical implications of deviating from the standard procedure and advocate for upholding fairness and transparency in procurement decisions.

Question 4:
As the President of Trueheart Engineers, I would request a meeting with the County Public Works Department to seek clarification on the reasons for the delay in contract approval and the subsequent hiring of Nearby Engineers. I would express our concerns regarding the fairness of the procurement process and request feedback on how we can improve our future interactions. By engaging in open communication and seeking constructive feedback, I would aim to maintain a professional relationship with the department and address any potential issues that may have arisen during the selection process.
