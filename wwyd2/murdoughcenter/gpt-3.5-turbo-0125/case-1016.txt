Question 1:
As the President of Nearby Engineers, I would respectfully decline to submit an additional proposal for the project, as Trueheart Engineers have already been selected by the Public Works staff. I would communicate our decision in writing to the County Public Works Department, emphasizing our commitment to ethical business practices and the importance of honoring the integrity of the selection process.

Question 2:
As a professional engineer on the County Public Works Department staff and a member of the interview/selection team, I would document the discrepancies between the announced QBS selection process and the Director of Public Works' decision to hire Nearby Engineers. I would request a meeting with the Director to discuss the concerns and seek clarification on the reasons for the deviation from the established process. If necessary, I would escalate the issue to the department's ethics committee or relevant authorities for further review.

Question 3:
As the Director of Public Works, upon receiving instructions to hire Nearby Engineers regardless of the announced QBS selection procedure, I would respectfully decline to proceed with the directive. I would schedule a meeting with the Board of Supervisors to discuss the importance of following the established selection process and upholding ethical standards in procurement. I would present the facts surrounding the selection process and advocate for transparency and fairness in consultant selection.

Question 4:
As the President of Trueheart Engineers, after being notified of the change in selection to Nearby Engineers, I would request a debriefing meeting with the County Public Works Department to understand the reasons for the decision. I would seek feedback on our proposal and the selection process to identify areas for improvement. Additionally, I would express our commitment to professionalism and ethical conduct in all business dealings, reinforcing our dedication to delivering high-quality services to our clients.
