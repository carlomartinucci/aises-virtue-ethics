Clayton should schedule a private meeting with Eleanor to discuss her current challenges and explore potential adjustments to her role within the Public Works department. During the meeting, Clayton should express his understanding of Eleanor's situation and acknowledge her past contributions to the department. He should propose reassigning Eleanor to a role that aligns better with her current health and energy levels, such as focusing on administrative tasks or providing support in a different capacity.

Clayton should involve Eleanor in the decision-making process by seeking her input on the proposed role adjustment. By collaborating with Eleanor to find a solution that accommodates her needs and preferences, Clayton can ensure that she feels valued and supported during this difficult time.

Additionally, Clayton should communicate with the rest of the team, including the City Engineer/Deputy Director Allan, to explain the rationale behind the decision to adjust Eleanor's role. By fostering transparency and open communication within the department, Clayton can address any potential concerns or misunderstandings that may arise.

To facilitate a smooth transition, Clayton should provide training or support to help Eleanor adapt to her new responsibilities. By offering ongoing assistance and guidance, Clayton can ensure that Eleanor's workload is manageable and that she can continue to contribute effectively to the department.

Overall, by taking a proactive and empathetic approach to addressing Eleanor's challenges, Clayton can demonstrate his commitment to supporting his team members while maintaining the department's operational efficiency.
