I would initiate a proactive approach by preparing a detailed breakdown of the overhead costs associated with long-distance telephone charges and presenting this information to clients during project discussions. This breakdown would include a clear explanation of the business taxes, professional liability insurance costs, and financing expenses incurred by the consulting firm. By transparently sharing these details with clients, I aim to educate them on the financial implications of these expenses and emphasize the need for a fair cost-sharing arrangement.

In addition, I would propose different options for cost-sharing, such as suggesting a percentage-based markup on long-distance telephone charges to cover overhead costs. This approach allows clients to understand the rationale behind the markup and provides them with the opportunity to choose a cost-sharing method that aligns with their budget and expectations. By engaging in collaborative discussions with clients and seeking their input on the preferred cost-sharing approach, I aim to establish a mutually beneficial agreement that promotes transparency and fairness in billing practices.

Furthermore, I would emphasize the importance of ongoing communication with clients throughout the project to address any concerns or questions related to billing and expenses. By maintaining open lines of communication and providing regular updates on cost-sharing arrangements, I seek to build trust and strengthen the relationship with clients based on transparency and mutual understanding.
