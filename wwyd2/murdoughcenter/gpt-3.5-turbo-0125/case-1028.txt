To address the issue of long-distance telephone charges and overhead costs, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Implement a standardized cost allocation method: I would develop a clear and transparent cost allocation method that includes overhead expenses associated with long-distance telephone charges. This method would calculate a fair percentage markup to cover these costs while ensuring that clients are aware of the breakdown of expenses.

By establishing a standardized cost allocation method, we can ensure consistency in billing practices and provide clients with a clear understanding of how overhead costs are factored into their invoices. This approach promotes transparency and fairness in billing while also safeguarding the firm's financial sustainability.

By taking this concrete step, we can address the issue of long-distance telephone charges in a practical and ethical manner, demonstrating our commitment to open communication and integrity in our business practices.
