I would discreetly gather more evidence to substantiate my suspicions regarding the potential conflict of interest involving Roy and Hotspark Electrical. This could involve documenting any further unusual interactions between Roy and the young woman or seeking information from other employees who may have observed similar behavior.

Once I have gathered sufficient evidence, I would schedule a meeting with the president of Global Engineering and Construction to present my findings. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about the possible preferential treatment being given to Hotspark and the potential impact on the firm's projects and reputation.

Based on the president's guidance, I would then take appropriate action, which may include implementing a formal investigation into the matter, reassigning responsibilities within the branch office to minimize the risk of conflicts of interest, or considering disciplinary measures if the evidence warrants it. It is crucial to address the situation promptly and effectively to uphold the integrity of the firm and ensure fair treatment of all subcontractors.
