I would start by discreetly documenting any instances of potential preferential treatment or compromised work quality by Hotspark Electrical on the ongoing projects. This documentation could include detailed notes, emails, or any other evidence that supports my suspicions.

Next, I would schedule a meeting with the president of Global Engineering and Construction to present the documented evidence and express my concerns about the situation. During the meeting, I would propose implementing a more rigorous monitoring system for projects involving Hotspark to ensure that the work quality is not compromised due to any conflicts of interest.

Additionally, I would suggest conducting a thorough review of the contracts and agreements with Hotspark to ensure that they are fair and transparent. If necessary, I would recommend seeking legal advice to address any potential legal implications of the situation.

Finally, I would work with HR to establish clear guidelines and policies regarding personal relationships with subcontractors to prevent similar conflicts of interest in the future. By taking these specific actions, I aim to address the current situation ethically and practically while safeguarding the firm's interests and reputation.
