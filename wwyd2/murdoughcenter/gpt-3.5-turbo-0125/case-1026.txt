Jack should immediately contact the drilling crew and geologist who conducted the borings for the project. He should request a meeting with them as soon as possible to discuss the discrepancies between the provided boring logs and the actual site conditions. During the meeting, Jack should carefully review the data collected during the borings and compare it with the project requirements. If necessary, Jack should consider conducting additional borings or tests to obtain the necessary data for his foundation design recommendations.

After gathering all relevant information and clarifications from the drilling crew and geologist, Jack should document the discrepancies and resolutions for future reference and accountability. He should involve other relevant stakeholders within the firm, such as senior engineers or project managers, for additional insights and support in resolving the issue.

To manage the project timeline effectively, Jack should communicate any delays or changes to the client promptly and transparently. If the deadline for the foundation design recommendation report is at risk, Jack should work with the client to adjust expectations and ensure that the final recommendations are based on accurate and reliable data.
