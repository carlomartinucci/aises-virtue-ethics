To address the scenario effectively, Jack should take the following specific actions:

1. Immediately contact the drilling crew and geologist to request a detailed explanation of the discrepancies between the provided boring logs and the actual site conditions. Arrange a meeting to review the data and discuss the specific locations, depths, and procedures followed during the drilling operations.

2. Conduct a thorough on-site investigation with the drilling crew and geologist to verify the accuracy of the subsurface exploration logs and data. Document any discrepancies and ensure that all relevant information is accurately recorded for analysis.

3. If necessary, arrange for additional borings or tests to be conducted at the site to gather the required data for the foundation design recommendations. Supervise the new data collection process to ensure accuracy and completeness.

4. Communicate transparently with the client about the discrepancies in the data and any potential impact on the project timeline. Provide regular updates on the progress of resolving the issue and seek their input on potential solutions.

5. Collaborate with senior engineers or project managers within the firm to review the data, analyze the findings, and make informed decisions regarding the foundation design recommendations. Utilize their expertise to address any technical challenges and ensure the accuracy and reliability of the final report.

By following these specific actions, Jack can address the discrepancies in the data provided by the drilling crew and geologist, maintain transparency with the client, and work towards delivering accurate and reliable foundation design recommendations within the project timeline.
