In response to the scenario, I would advise Julie to immediately contact the local building authorities to report the structural issues with the Inverness Block, specifically the rusted clip angles that pose a serious risk to public safety. This action is crucial in ensuring that the necessary steps are taken to address the potential hazards associated with the building.

Additionally, I would recommend that Julie document all communication with Charles Smith regarding the structural concerns in writing. By sending a formal letter outlining the issues and the implications for public safety, Julie can ensure that there is a clear record of her efforts to address the situation responsibly.

Moreover, I would suggest that Julie seek a second opinion from another structural engineer to verify the findings of Brock Williams regarding the rusted clip angles. This step can provide Julie with additional assurance and clarity on the structural integrity of the building.

By taking these specific actions, Julie can demonstrate her commitment to public safety and ethical standards in her profession while also protecting her business interests and professional reputation.
