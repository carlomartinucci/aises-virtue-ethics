Shariq should immediately contact Chuck to express his concerns about the discrepancy in the sampling results of the drums. He should request a meeting with Chuck to discuss the situation in detail and present the evidence he has gathered, including the notes, chain-of-custody records, and any communication related to the sampling.

During the meeting, Shariq should emphasize the importance of accuracy and transparency in environmental assessments and express his commitment to ensuring that the client receives reliable information. He should propose conducting proper testing of the drum contents to confirm their classification and provide accurate data to the client and regulatory authorities.

If Chuck is receptive to Shariq's concerns and agrees to address the issue by conducting additional testing, Shariq should work collaboratively with him to ensure that the proper procedures are followed and the results are communicated accurately.

However, if Chuck dismisses or ignores Shariq's concerns, Shariq should consider escalating the matter to higher management within Everclere Consultants, Inc. or reporting it to the appropriate regulatory agencies to ensure that ethical standards are upheld and the situation is handled appropriately.
