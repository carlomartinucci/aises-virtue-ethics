In response to the scenario, I would first gather all the documentation related to the sampling of the drums, including notes, chain-of-custody records, and communication with Chuck. I would then schedule a meeting with Chuck to discuss the discrepancy between the information provided to me and the actions taken by the remediation contractor. During the meeting, I would present the evidence and express my concerns about the potential misrepresentation of the sampling results to the client.

If Chuck denies any wrongdoing or is unwilling to address the issue, I would escalate the matter to higher management within Everclere Consultants, Inc. to ensure that ethical standards are upheld and that the situation is rectified appropriately. I would emphasize the importance of conducting proper testing of the drum contents to ensure accurate information is provided to the client and regulatory authorities. If necessary, I would be prepared to involve regulatory agencies to investigate the situation further and ensure compliance with environmental regulations.
