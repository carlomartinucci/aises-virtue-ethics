I would thank John Bigge for considering me for the final engineering design of the project and express my gratitude for the opportunity. I would then ask for a meeting to discuss the concerns raised by Weeks and Weeks in their preliminary report. During the meeting, I would seek clarification on the specific recommendations deemed unrealistic by both the developer and the planning commission. I would also inquire about any potential conflicts of interest that may arise from taking over the project from a competitor.

Additionally, I would provide a brief overview of my experience with similar projects, highlighting successful outcomes and demonstrating my familiarity with the site conditions. I would assure John Bigge of my commitment to delivering high-quality engineering services and propose a collaborative approach, if necessary, to ensure a smooth transition and continuity in the project. Finally, I would confirm my interest in working on the project and emphasize my dedication to meeting the project requirements effectively and efficiently.
