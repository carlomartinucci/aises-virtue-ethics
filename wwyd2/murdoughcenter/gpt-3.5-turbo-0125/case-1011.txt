I would thank John Bigge for considering me for the final engineering design of the project. To address any potential conflicts of interest, I would disclose my past professional relationship with Weeks and Weeks, emphasizing my commitment to maintaining objectivity and providing the best engineering solutions for the project. I would propose a meeting with John to discuss the concerns raised by Weeks and Weeks in their preliminary report, seeking clarification on specific issues and recommendations. Additionally, I would suggest conducting a joint site visit with both John and representatives from Weeks and Weeks to assess the site conditions collaboratively. This approach would ensure transparency, open communication, and a shared understanding of the project requirements, ultimately leading to a more informed and ethical decision-making process.
