To address the situation, I would respectfully decline the offer from Mr. Owatadeel and International Affiliates Ltd. due to the excessive fees and potential ethical concerns. Instead, I would leverage my network to identify reputable local partners in Utopia who have a proven track record of ethical business practices.

Additionally, I would conduct thorough due diligence on the recommended local partners, including reviewing their past projects, client testimonials, and any potential conflicts of interest. This specific step will help ensure that Choice Engineering aligns with partners who uphold ethical standards and share the company's commitment to integrity.

Furthermore, I would explore alternative strategies for establishing a local presence in Utopia, such as setting up a satellite office or partnering with a reputable local consultancy firm that specializes in international business relations. By taking concrete steps to identify ethical local partners and diversifying the approach to market entry, Choice Engineering can navigate the business landscape in Utopia responsibly and ethically.

In summary, by declining the offer from International Affiliates Ltd., conducting thorough due diligence on recommended local partners, and exploring alternative strategies for market entry, Choice Engineering can uphold ethical standards while pursuing business opportunities in Utopia.
