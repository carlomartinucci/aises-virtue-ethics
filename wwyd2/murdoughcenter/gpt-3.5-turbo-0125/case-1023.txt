I would first schedule a meeting with Moover Design Consultants to discuss the lack of communication and the concerns raised by Chuck Cleaver regarding our involvement in the project. During the meeting, I would express our expectations for clear and open communication throughout the project and seek clarification on the role of our firm as the structural engineering subconsultant.

If the meeting with Moover does not yield satisfactory results or if the issues persist, I would then consider reaching out to the agency funding the project to express our concerns and request a meeting to discuss the situation. I would present any relevant documentation, such as our initial agreement with Moover and the scope of work, to support our position and emphasize our firm's commitment to the project.

By taking these steps, I aim to address the communication issues with Moover Design Consultants directly while also involving the agency funding the project if necessary to ensure transparency and collaboration in resolving the situation. This approach prioritizes clear communication, proactive problem-solving, and maintaining the integrity of our firm's involvement in the project.
