I would immediately schedule a face-to-face meeting with Moover Design Consultants to discuss our concerns regarding the lack of communication and discrepancy in our involvement in the project. During the meeting, I would clearly outline our expectations for collaboration and request a detailed breakdown of the work allocation and timeline moving forward. I would also emphasize the importance of maintaining open and transparent communication throughout the project.

In addition, I would document all discussions and agreements made during the meeting to ensure clarity and accountability. If necessary, I would seek clarification on the roles and responsibilities of our firm as the subconsultant and address any discrepancies in the initial agreement. 

Furthermore, I would consider reaching out to the agency funding the project to express our concerns and seek their intervention if the issues with Moover Design Consultants persist. It is essential to protect our firm's interests and ensure that we are valued as a key contributor to the project.

By taking these specific actions, we can address the ethical concerns raised in the scenario and work towards a mutually beneficial and transparent collaboration with Moover Design Consultants.
