To address the situation, Gwen should schedule a meeting with Lawrence to propose implementing a monitoring system through the company's server to track email usage patterns. This system would generate reports on email activity trends without accessing individual PCs, ensuring employee privacy is respected. Gwen should also suggest conducting training sessions on email etiquette to educate employees on appropriate email usage and the importance of professionalism in their communications. Additionally, Gwen should recommend involving HR to ensure that any monitoring activities align with company policies and legal requirements. By taking these steps, Gwen can effectively address the issue of excessive personal email use while upholding ethical standards and fostering a culture of transparency and trust within the company.
