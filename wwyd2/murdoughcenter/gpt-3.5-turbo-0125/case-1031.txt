Gwen should schedule a meeting with Lawrence to discuss the concerns regarding employees' excessive personal use of email. During the meeting, she should propose implementing a monitoring system through the company's server to track email usage patterns without accessing individual PCs. This system could generate reports on email activity trends, highlighting any potential misuse or excessive personal use.

Gwen should also suggest conducting training sessions on email etiquette to educate employees on appropriate email usage and the importance of maintaining professionalism in their communications. By providing guidance and setting clear expectations, employees may be more inclined to adhere to company policies regarding email usage.

Furthermore, Gwen should emphasize the importance of respecting employees' privacy and building trust within the workplace. She can explain to Lawrence the potential negative impact on employee morale and company culture if individual email files are accessed without consent. By promoting a culture of transparency and open communication, Gwen can work towards finding a solution that addresses the issue of email misuse while upholding ethical standards and respecting employees' privacy rights.
