I would schedule a meeting with Charlie Oxx to discuss the situation. During the meeting, I would express my discomfort with the expectation of making political contributions in exchange for career advancement. I would respectfully communicate that I am not comfortable with this practice and would like to explore alternative ways to demonstrate loyalty to the company and support its goals. I would suggest focusing on my work performance and dedication to the projects as a means of contributing to the firm's success. Additionally, I would inquire about other opportunities for professional growth and advancement within the company that are based on merit and skills rather than financial contributions. Finally, I would document the details of the meeting and any agreements or action points discussed for future reference.
