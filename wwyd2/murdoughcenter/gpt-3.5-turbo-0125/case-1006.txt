I would schedule a private meeting with Charlie Oxx to discuss my concerns about the expectation of making political contributions for career advancement. During the meeting, I would respectfully express that while I value the opportunities provided by CWE, I am uncomfortable with the idea of contributing to the council members' campaign funds. I would emphasize my commitment to performing my job diligently and ethically, and my belief that career advancement should be based on merit and professional growth rather than financial contributions.

Additionally, I would seek guidance from HR to understand the company's policies regarding political contributions and conflicts of interest. I would inquire about alternative ways to demonstrate loyalty and commitment to the firm without engaging in political contributions. By proactively seeking clarification on company policies and exploring alternative avenues for demonstrating loyalty, I aim to navigate the situation ethically and in alignment with the organization's values.

Ultimately, my goal is to address the issue transparently, uphold my integrity, and seek a resolution that allows me to maintain my ethical principles while navigating the expectations within the company.
