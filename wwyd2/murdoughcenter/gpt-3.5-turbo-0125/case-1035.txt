Robert should immediately schedule a meeting with Walker, Larry, and James to discuss the discrepancies in the foundation design and construction process. During the meeting, Robert should present a detailed analysis of the over-designed foundation and the potential risks associated with it. He should propose involving a qualified structural engineer to review and modify the foundation plans to align with the geotechnical report.

Robert should advocate for implementing quality control measures and regular monitoring during the construction phase to ensure compliance with the revised design. He should emphasize the importance of prioritizing structural integrity while minimizing unnecessary expenses. Additionally, Robert should express his concerns about potential liabilities and the inefficient use of resources due to the over-designed foundation.

By taking these specific actions and collaborating with all stakeholders, Robert can work towards ensuring the successful completion of the project while upholding ethical standards and professional integrity.
