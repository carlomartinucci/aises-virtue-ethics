Robert should schedule an urgent meeting with Walker, Larry, and any other relevant stakeholders to address the discrepancies in the construction plans. During the meeting, he should present a detailed analysis of the over-designed foundation and the potential risks associated with it. Robert should propose a revised construction plan that aligns with his geotechnical recommendations while ensuring cost-efficiency and structural integrity.

In the meeting, Robert should emphasize the importance of quality control measures and monitoring during the construction process to prevent any further issues. He should offer his expertise to collaborate with Larry in developing a new foundation design that meets the project's requirements without unnecessary over-design. Additionally, Robert should stress the need for transparent communication and a shared understanding of the revised plan among all parties involved.

Furthermore, Robert should advocate for ongoing collaboration and regular progress updates to ensure that the construction aligns with the revised plan. By taking proactive steps to address the discrepancies and promote ethical engineering practices, Robert can help mitigate risks, improve project efficiency, and uphold professional standards in the industry.
