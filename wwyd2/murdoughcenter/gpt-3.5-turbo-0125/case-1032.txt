I would recommend Topher to schedule a meeting with the design engineers and the development team to discuss the potential impacts of the Windsor Ridge development on the poorer families living south of the area. During this meeting, Topher should advocate for a thorough assessment of the secondary impacts on the downstream community and propose alternative design solutions that mitigate these effects.

Specifically, Topher should request the design engineers to conduct a detailed analysis of the traffic patterns and drainage modifications that may result from the development. By identifying potential challenges and proposing innovative design adjustments, Topher can ensure that the project minimizes adverse effects on the existing residents while still meeting regulatory requirements.

Furthermore, I would advise Topher to collaborate with local stakeholders, including community leaders and representatives from the impacted families, to gather input and feedback on the proposed solutions. By involving the community in the decision-making process and valuing their perspectives, Topher can demonstrate a commitment to ethical leadership and responsible governance.

After evaluating the revised design plans and incorporating community feedback, Topher should present the updated proposal to the City Council for review and approval. By transparently communicating the potential impacts and the proposed solutions, Topher can ensure that the decision-making process is inclusive and considers the well-being of all residents in Plebian.

Overall, by taking proactive steps to address the concerns of the impacted community and advocating for sustainable design solutions, Topher can navigate the ethical dilemma presented by the Windsor Ridge development while upholding the values of community engagement and responsible decision-making.
