Arthur and David should take the following specific actions to address the conflict of interest situation:

They should proactively reach out to Monroe, the competitor engineer, to discuss his concerns and clarify their commitment to ethical conduct. By openly addressing the issue and engaging in a constructive dialogue, they can demonstrate transparency and a willingness to address any potential conflicts.

Additionally, Arthur and David should publicly disclose the potential conflict of interest to the Fairview community, the Fairview CSC, and other relevant stakeholders. This transparency will help maintain trust and integrity in their involvement in the project.

Furthermore, they should seek guidance from an independent ethics committee or professional organization to review their actions and ensure they are in compliance with ethical standards. This external review can provide valuable insights and recommendations for navigating the conflict of interest situation effectively.

By taking these steps, Arthur and David can demonstrate their commitment to ethical behavior, transparency, and accountability in their community involvement, ultimately safeguarding the integrity of the project and their professional reputation.
