Daulton should immediately schedule a meeting with Elias and Shellie to address the undisclosed ownership of the property. During the meeting, he should express his disappointment in their lack of transparency and emphasize the potential ethical implications of their actions. Daulton should request that Elias and Shellie either divest themselves of the property or take steps to mitigate the conflict of interest.

Additionally, Daulton should inform Conner about the situation and instruct him to proceed with caution in the negotiations for the property acquisition. He should also seek legal advice to ensure that the acquisition process is handled appropriately and ethically.

Daulton should document the meeting with Elias and Shellie, as well as any decisions made regarding the conflict of interest. He should also consider involving ClearWater Developers' legal department or an external ethics committee to provide guidance on how to address the situation effectively and in accordance with ethical standards.
