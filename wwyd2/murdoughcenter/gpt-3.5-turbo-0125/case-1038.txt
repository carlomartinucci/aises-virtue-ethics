Daulton should immediately schedule a private meeting with Elias and Shellie to discuss the undisclosed ownership of the property in Walbert Township. During the meeting, he should express his concerns about the conflict of interest and request that Elias and Shellie provide a clear explanation for their failure to disclose this information. Daulton should emphasize the importance of transparency and ethical conduct in all business dealings.

If Elias and Shellie refuse to divest themselves of the property or react negatively to Daulton's concerns, he should seek guidance from ClearWater Developers' legal department on the appropriate course of action. Daulton should also inform Conner about the situation and instruct him to suspend any negotiations related to the property acquisition until the conflict of interest is resolved.

To maintain transparency and trust in the project, Daulton should consider disclosing the situation to relevant stakeholders, such as regulatory authorities or community representatives, in a manner that protects the company's reputation and integrity. Additionally, Daulton should document all interactions and decisions related to the conflict of interest to ensure accountability and compliance with ethical standards.
