To address the pump failures at the treatment plant in Elm Grove, I would take the following specific actions:

1. **Revisit the Initial Pump Selection Decision**: I would conduct a thorough review of the decision-making process that led to choosing Pumpco pumps over Excelsior pumps. This review would involve analyzing the factors considered, such as cost, reliability, and long-term maintenance, to identify any oversights or shortcomings in the evaluation.

By focusing on reassessing the initial pump selection decision, we can gain insights into potential gaps in the decision-making process and learn from past mistakes to prevent similar issues in the future. This proactive approach will help ensure that future equipment selections prioritize long-term reliability and performance over short-term cost considerations.
