I would immediately reach out to the city's project manager, Dee Taylor, to discuss the recent pump failures at the treatment plant in Elm Grove. During this conversation, I would propose conducting an independent assessment of the pump failures by hiring a third-party expert specializing in pump systems. This expert would investigate the root causes of the failures and provide recommendations for addressing the issue effectively.

In addition to engaging the third-party expert, I would also contact the manufacturer of the pumps, Pumpco, to discuss the failures and explore potential solutions or warranty coverage. Collaborating with Pumpco could provide valuable insights and options for resolving the issue, potentially leading to a more cost-effective and efficient solution.

Furthermore, I would suggest convening a joint meeting with Dee Taylor, the project engineer Florence Moore, the third-party expert, and representatives from Pumpco to review the assessment findings and discuss potential solutions collaboratively. This approach would ensure that all stakeholders are involved in the decision-making process and that the best course of action is determined based on expert analysis and manufacturer input.

Ultimately, by engaging both the third-party expert and the pump manufacturer, we can take a comprehensive and collaborative approach to understanding and resolving the pump failures at the treatment plant in Elm Grove, ensuring transparency, accountability, and effective problem-solving.
