I would schedule individual meetings with each of the seven students who submitted the identical project reports to discuss the issue of plagiarism. During these meetings, I would present the evidence of the similarities in their reports and allow them the opportunity to provide any explanations or insights into the situation.

Based on the university's academic integrity policy, I would determine the appropriate consequences for each student involved in the plagiarism. This may include failing the project, failing the course, or other disciplinary actions as outlined by university guidelines. I would ensure that the consequences are applied consistently and fairly to all students involved.

In addition to addressing the immediate issue, I would emphasize the importance of academic integrity and proper citation practices to all students in the course. I would provide resources and guidance on how to avoid plagiarism in future assignments and reinforce the university's expectations regarding ethical academic behavior.

Furthermore, I would report the incident to the university's academic integrity office for further investigation and potential disciplinary action. By involving the appropriate authorities, I would uphold the university's standards of academic honesty and ensure that the incident is handled in a transparent and accountable manner.
