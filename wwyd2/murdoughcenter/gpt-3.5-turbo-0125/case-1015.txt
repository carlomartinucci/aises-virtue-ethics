I would schedule a meeting with the contractor and project manager to discuss the foundation design recommendations in person. During the meeting, I would present a detailed analysis of the geotechnical conditions at the site, emphasizing the potential risks associated with using shallow footings instead of piles. I would clearly outline the long-term settlement issues that could arise and the implications for the structural integrity of the buildings.

To address the contractor's concerns about the warranty period, I would propose a compromise solution. I would suggest incorporating a monitoring program during the first year after construction to track any settlement issues that may arise. This monitoring program would provide real-time data on the performance of the foundations and allow for early detection of any potential problems.

If the contractor continues to push for shallow footings despite the evidence presented, I would document all communication and decisions made regarding the foundation design. I would seek explicit approval from the project manager or legal counsel before proceeding with any design changes that deviate from the recommended pile foundations. This documentation and approval process would provide a clear record of the discussions and decisions made, ensuring transparency and accountability in the project.

By taking a collaborative approach, providing evidence-based recommendations, proposing a compromise solution with a monitoring program, and seeking explicit approval from project management or legal counsel, I aim to find a solution that balances the contractor's concerns with the long-term structural integrity of the buildings.
