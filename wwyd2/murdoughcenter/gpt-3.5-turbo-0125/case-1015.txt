I would schedule a face-to-face meeting with the contractor and other key stakeholders to discuss the foundation design recommendations in detail. During the meeting, I would present a comprehensive analysis of the potential risks associated with using shallow footings instead of piles based on the site-specific conditions and soil characteristics. I would provide specific examples and case studies to illustrate the potential consequences of settling for a suboptimal foundation design.

I would emphasize the importance of prioritizing the long-term structural integrity and safety of the buildings to ensure the well-being of future occupants. I would address any concerns or questions raised by the contractor and other team members, encouraging an open dialogue to find a mutually agreeable solution that aligns with the project's long-term goals and objectives.

If the contractor continues to insist on using shallow footings despite the risks identified, I would clearly outline the legal and ethical responsibilities associated with my role as a geotechnical engineer. I would explain the potential liabilities and consequences of deviating from the recommended foundation design, ensuring that all parties involved are fully informed of the risks and implications of their decisions.

I would document the discussions and decisions made during the meeting in writing, including the rationale behind the recommended foundation design and the potential risks associated with alternative approaches. By maintaining transparency and accountability throughout the decision-making process, I would uphold the highest standards of professional ethics and integrity in my role as a geotechnical engineer.
