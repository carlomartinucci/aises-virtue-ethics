Rod should discreetly document each instance of foremen putting gifts in the resident engineer's pickup truck. He should then schedule a private meeting with his supervisor, Jim Upwright, to discuss his observations and present the documented evidence. During the meeting, Rod should express his concerns about the potential ethical implications of these gifts and seek guidance on how to proceed.

Additionally, Rod should reach out to the ethics advisor at his university for further advice on handling the situation. He should also consider discussing the issue with a trusted colleague to gain additional perspectives and insights.

By taking these steps, Rod can ensure that the ethical dilemma is addressed in a transparent and responsible manner, while also seeking guidance from relevant parties to navigate the situation effectively.
