To address the situation where Rod Traverse has observed gifts being given to the resident engineer, Jim Upwright, I would advise Rod to discreetly document each instance of gifts received by the foremen. Rod should then schedule a private meeting with Jim Upwright to discuss his observations and present the documented evidence. During the meeting, Rod should express his concerns about the potential ethical implications of the gifts and emphasize the importance of maintaining integrity and impartiality in their roles.

Following the meeting with Jim Upwright, Rod should request guidance from the ethics advisor at the DOT headquarters on how to proceed further. The ethics advisor can provide specific recommendations on the appropriate steps to take, including reporting the issue to the relevant authorities within the DOT and ensuring that proper investigations are conducted.

Additionally, Rod should inform his university advisor, Dr. R. E. Serchur, about the situation and seek advice on how to handle the ethical dilemma while maintaining his academic integrity. Dr. Serchur may provide additional support and guidance on navigating the complexities of the situation and ensuring that Rod's academic standing is not compromised.

By taking these specific actions, Rod can address the ethical concerns raised by the gifts being given to the resident engineer in a responsible and proactive manner, ensuring transparency, accountability, and upholding ethical standards in the workplace.
