To address the quality concern regarding the steel beams' coating issue, Rashid should take the following specific actions:

1. Document the Problem: Rashid should take detailed photographs and notes of the steel beams that are inaccessible for the coating procedure, highlighting the areas where the coating has not been applied as per specifications.

2. Consult with the Inspector: Rashid should discreetly approach the building inspector, Janis, who previously raised a question about the coating during the inspection. He should seek Janis's opinion on the potential issue and gather any additional insights or recommendations she may have.

3. Request a Follow-Up Inspection: Rashid should request a follow-up inspection with Janis to specifically review the coating on the steel beams in question. This will provide an opportunity for a more thorough assessment and verification of the coating quality.

4. Present Findings to Riley: Armed with documented evidence and potential support from the building inspector, Rashid should schedule a private meeting with Riley. During the meeting, he should present the evidence, including photographs and notes, and express his concerns about the compromised coating's impact on safety and project quality.

5. Propose a Solution: Rashid should propose a solution to rectify the issue, such as bringing in a third-party quality control expert to assess the coating on the steel beams. By offering a proactive solution, Rashid demonstrates his commitment to addressing the problem effectively.

6. Follow Up: After presenting the findings and proposed solution to Riley, Rashid should follow up to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to address the quality concern. He should continue to monitor the situation and communicate any updates or progress to relevant stakeholders.

By taking these specific actions, Rashid can address the quality concern ethically and practically, ensuring that safety standards are upheld and project quality is maintained.
