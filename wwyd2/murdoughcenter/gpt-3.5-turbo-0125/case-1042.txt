Rashid should immediately document the issue by taking detailed notes and photographs of the inaccessible steel beams and the potential oversight in the coating procedure. He should then schedule a meeting with Riley to discuss his concerns. During the meeting, Rashid should present the evidence he has gathered and propose a solution to address the problem without causing significant delays to the project.

In the meeting with Riley, Rashid should suggest bringing in additional resources or finding alternative ways to ensure that the coating is applied correctly to the inaccessible areas. He should emphasize the importance of upholding safety standards and meeting project specifications. If Riley dismisses his concerns, Rashid should consider escalating the issue to higher management or the appropriate regulatory authorities.

Rashid should also seek guidance from experienced colleagues or mentors within the company to understand the best course of action in handling such situations. By taking proactive steps to address the problem, Rashid can demonstrate his commitment to public safety and quality standards while navigating potential conflicts with his superiors effectively.
