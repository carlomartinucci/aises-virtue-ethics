In the morning, I would have a candid discussion with Bill Broot about the cost estimate for the new project site. I would inform him that the estimated cost for the design work on the new project site, leveraging information and analyses from the Dawson site, would be $22,800. Additionally, I would take full responsibility for the budget overrun on the Dawson project and propose a solution to cover the additional costs incurred.

To address the unauthorized work on the Dawson project, I would suggest negotiating with Bill Broot to reach a fair resolution. This could involve discussing potential options for covering the additional costs, such as adjusting the budget for the new project site or spreading the additional costs over multiple projects. By openly addressing the budget overrun issue and proposing a practical solution, I aim to demonstrate our commitment to financial transparency and accountability while maintaining a positive and collaborative relationship with the client.
