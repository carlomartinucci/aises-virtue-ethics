In the morning, I would schedule a meeting with Bill Broot to discuss the cost estimate for the new project site. During the meeting, I would start by presenting a detailed breakdown of the $22,800 cost estimate, emphasizing the cost-saving benefits of leveraging existing information from the Dawson site. I would explain how we plan to utilize the data efficiently to streamline the design process and reduce costs.

To address the budget overrun on the Dawson project, I would propose implementing a more robust project monitoring system. This system would involve regular budget reviews, milestone tracking, and proactive communication with the client to ensure that any deviations from the budget are promptly addressed. I would also suggest setting up a mid-project review meeting with Bill to provide updates on the project's financial status and address any potential budget concerns proactively.

Furthermore, I would offer to provide a revised contract for the new project site that includes clear terms and conditions outlining the scope of work, deliverables, and budget constraints. This revised contract would aim to prevent any misunderstandings regarding project costs and ensure that both parties are aligned on the project's financial aspects from the outset.

By taking these concrete steps, including implementing a robust project monitoring system, providing transparent communication with the client, and offering a revised contract with clear terms, I aim to address the budget overrun issue, rebuild trust with Bill Broot, and establish a foundation for successful project delivery while maintaining ethical business practices.
