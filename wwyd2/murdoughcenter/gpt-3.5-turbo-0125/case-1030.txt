Reilly should immediately contact a certified fire safety expert to conduct a thorough inspection of the treatment room to determine if it meets the requirements for explosion-proof classification as per NFPA 820. He should request a detailed report outlining any deficiencies or areas of non-compliance. Reilly should then present this report to Dante and the project manager at SGOH, emphasizing the importance of ensuring the safety and compliance of the wastewater treatment plant. If the room is found to be non-compliant, Reilly should work with the project team to develop a plan to rectify the issues, ensuring that the necessary safety measures are implemented without compromising the project timeline.
