Reilly should immediately schedule a meeting with a certified fire safety expert to conduct a thorough inspection of the treatment room in question. During the inspection, they should specifically assess the electrical sockets, light switches, lighting fixtures, and junction boxes to determine if they meet the explosion-proof requirements outlined in NFPA 820. Reilly should document all findings and discrepancies observed during the inspection.

Following the inspection, Reilly should compile a detailed report outlining the expert's assessment and recommendations regarding the room's compliance with the NFPA 820 code. This report should be presented to Dante, the project manager at SGOH, and any other relevant stakeholders to ensure transparency and accountability.

If the inspection reveals that the treatment room does not meet the necessary safety standards, Reilly should work with the fire safety expert to develop a plan for bringing the room up to code. This may involve implementing necessary safety measures, retrofitting the existing facilities, or making other modifications to ensure compliance with NFPA 820.

By taking proactive steps to verify the safety compliance of the treatment room and addressing any potential issues promptly, Reilly can uphold ethical standards, prioritize the safety of the wastewater treatment plant, and mitigate risks associated with non-compliance.
