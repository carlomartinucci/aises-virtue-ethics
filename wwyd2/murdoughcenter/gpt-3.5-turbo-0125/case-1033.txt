Dianne should schedule a meeting with Warren to discuss her concerns about the potential impact on the old water main in Shadyvale. During the meeting, she should clearly outline the State DOT policy regarding utility conflicts and the financial implications for the local municipality. Dianne should present alternative design solutions that adhere to the policy while still meeting project requirements.

In the meeting, Dianne should emphasize the importance of ethical decision-making and the need to prioritize the interests of both the State DOT and the residents of Shadyvale. She should express her commitment to upholding the organization's standards and avoiding any actions that could compromise the integrity of the project.

If Warren insists on changing the design to impact the water main, Dianne should respectfully push back and reiterate the potential consequences of deviating from the policy. She should document the discussion and decisions made during the meeting to ensure transparency and accountability.

If the issue remains unresolved, Dianne should consider escalating the matter to a higher authority within the organization or seeking guidance from an ethics committee. By taking these steps, Dianne can navigate the situation ethically, uphold professional standards, and ensure that the project is executed in compliance with State DOT policies.
