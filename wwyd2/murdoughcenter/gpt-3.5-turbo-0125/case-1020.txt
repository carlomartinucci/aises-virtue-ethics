In response to the scenario, I would take the following specific actions:

1. Seek Legal Advice: I would immediately consult with a legal professional to understand my firm's rights and obligations in the situation. Legal counsel can provide guidance on how to navigate the mediation process effectively and protect our interests.

2. Document Interactions: I would meticulously document all interactions and communications with the other parties involved, including any evidence supporting our position. This documentation will serve as a clear record of events and help support our case during the mediation.

3. Present Technical Evidence: During the mediation hearing, I would present the technical facts related to the pile design recommendations made by our firm in a clear and compelling manner. I would emphasize that our recommendations were sound and that the issues with the pile driving were not a result of any fault on our part.

4. Address Threats to Professional License: If faced with threats to revoke our Professional Engineer's license, I would seek further legal advice on how to address this issue. I would ensure that our response is in line with professional standards and regulations while protecting our firm's reputation.

By taking these specific actions, I aim to protect our firm's interests, uphold ethical standards, and navigate the mediation process effectively in a challenging situation.
