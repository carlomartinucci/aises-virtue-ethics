I would attend the mediation hearing as requested by Noall's attorney and present the technical evidence supporting our firm's innocence in the faulty pile design recommendations. During the mediation, I would focus on explaining the specific issues with the pipe welding and the inadequate length of the pipe ordered by Deepdown Pile. I would firmly assert that our firm is not financially responsible for the additional costs incurred during pile driving.

If pressured to contribute financially, I would reiterate our firm's position based on the technical evidence and stand firm on not accepting liability for the claim. I would emphasize the importance of resolving the matter based on the facts and merits of the case rather than succumbing to financial pressure. Additionally, I would document all interactions and communications during the mediation process to ensure a comprehensive record of events.

In response to the threat of license revocation, I would seek legal advice to understand the implications and potential courses of action. I would handle the situation with professionalism and integrity, focusing on presenting the technical evidence and maintaining our firm's innocence throughout the mediation process.
