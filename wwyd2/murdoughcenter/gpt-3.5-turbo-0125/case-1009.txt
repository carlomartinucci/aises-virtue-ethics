I would immediately schedule a meeting with Mr. Young to discuss the situation and understand his decision to give the scope of work to a competitor. During the meeting, I would emphasize our firm's unique expertise and successful track record in similar projects. I would propose offering additional value-added services, such as a detailed project timeline or a comprehensive risk assessment, to showcase the benefits of working with our firm. Additionally, I would suggest adjusting the terms of the proposal to better align with the client's needs, such as offering a flexible payment schedule or a discount for early completion of the project. By actively engaging with the client, addressing their concerns, and providing tailored solutions, I aim to demonstrate our commitment to the project and potentially win back the client's trust and secure the project for our firm.
