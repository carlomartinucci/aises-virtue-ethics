I would schedule a meeting with Mr. Young to discuss his decision to give the scope of work to a competitor. During the meeting, I would emphasize the unique qualifications and experience of our firm, highlighting our successful track record and expertise in foundation investigations. I would address any concerns Mr. Young may have and reiterate the value that our firm can bring to the project.

In the meeting, I would propose a revised cost estimate that reflects the quality and thoroughness of our work. I would also offer to provide additional services or benefits to the project, such as expedited reporting or ongoing support throughout the construction phase. By demonstrating the added value that our firm can offer, I aim to showcase why we are the best choice for the foundation investigation.

Furthermore, I would establish clear boundaries and expectations regarding the handling of proposals and communication moving forward. I would emphasize the importance of transparency and open dialogue to ensure that both parties are aligned on the project scope, timeline, and budget. By setting clear expectations and maintaining open communication, I aim to prevent similar situations in the future and build a stronger working relationship with Mr. Young and his team.
