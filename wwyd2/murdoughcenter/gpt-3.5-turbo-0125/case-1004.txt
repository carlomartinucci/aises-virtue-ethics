I would immediately document the observed relationship between Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert and provide a detailed report to Fulton Adams. I would recommend that Adams file a motion with the court to disclose this potential conflict of interest and request that the judge address the issue before proceeding with the trial. Additionally, I would advise Adams to consult with legal ethics experts to ensure that the appropriate steps are taken to maintain the integrity of the legal proceedings. It is crucial to address the conflict of interest promptly to uphold the fairness and credibility of the trial.
