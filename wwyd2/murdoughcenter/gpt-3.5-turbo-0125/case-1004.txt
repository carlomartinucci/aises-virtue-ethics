I would promptly inform Fulton Adams about the discovered relationship between Clyde Cleghorn and Amanda Cuthbert. I would recommend documenting this information in a formal report outlining the potential conflict of interest and its implications for the ongoing case. I would advise Adams to raise this issue with the court to ensure transparency and fairness in the legal proceedings. Additionally, I would suggest seeking guidance from legal ethics experts on how to address the situation appropriately and ethically. It is crucial to disclose this information to all relevant parties involved in the case to maintain the integrity of the legal process.
