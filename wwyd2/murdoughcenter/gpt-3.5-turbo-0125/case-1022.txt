Improved Answer:

To address the critique and provide a more ethically sound and practical response:

In determining my fee for assisting Zeller Construction Inc., I would first conduct a detailed analysis of the project requirements and the value my expertise would bring to their construction problem. I would then propose a fee structure that is competitive yet reflective of the unique solution I can provide. To ensure transparency, I would present a breakdown of the fee, outlining the specific services included and the rationale behind the pricing. This approach would help build trust with Zeller and demonstrate a commitment to fair and ethical business practices.

If contacted by Hartwell to participate in the project, I would engage in open communication regarding the fee. I would reference the previous successful collaboration and the value I brought to their project to negotiate a fee that aligns with the current project's requirements. By discussing the fee openly and transparently, I aim to maintain a professional relationship with Hartwell while upholding ethical standards in fee negotiations.

In the scenario where Hartwell decides not to bid on the project, my approach to determining the fee for Zeller Construction Inc. would remain consistent. I would continue to assess the project requirements, expertise needed, and market rates to propose a fair fee structure to Zeller. By focusing on the specific details of the project and the value of my services, I aim to ensure ethical conduct and demonstrate integrity in my fee-setting process with Zeller.
