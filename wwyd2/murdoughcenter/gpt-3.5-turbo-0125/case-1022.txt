For Question 1:
To determine my fee for assisting Zeller Construction Inc., I would first assess the project requirements and the level of expertise needed to develop a solution for their construction problem. I would then research the current market rates for similar services in the local area to ensure that my fee is competitive and fair. Additionally, I would discuss with Zeller Construction Inc. the value that my solution would bring to their project and negotiate a fee that reflects this value while maintaining transparency throughout the fee negotiation process.

For Question 2:
If contacted by Hartwell Construction to participate in the project, I would evaluate the project scope and the potential benefits of my expertise to Hartwell. I would consider our past successful collaboration and the value of my solution in determining the fee. I would ensure that the fee negotiation process is transparent, clearly outlining the fee structure and rationale behind it to uphold ethical standards in our business relationship.

For Question 3:
If I find out that Hartwell has decided not to bid on the project, my approach to determining the fee for assisting Zeller Construction Inc. would remain consistent. I would continue to assess the project requirements, expertise needed, and market rates to negotiate a fair fee that aligns with the value of my services to Zeller Construction Inc. Transparency in fee negotiations would still be a priority to maintain ethical conduct in the business engagement.
