You are the primary treating psychiatrist for a 40-year- old man with schizophrenia which has proven difficult to control through ongoing treatment. Your patient has become convinced that he contracted syphilis through a recent sexual encounter, though he repeatedly tests negative for syphilis and other STDs. Confusingly, in other recent conversations he claimed not to have been sexually active in “a very long time.” 

He is becoming volatile and untrusting because you have not given him medicine for the syphilis. You worry that this anger could adversely affect his willingness to take the psychiatric medicines you are carefully calibrating to stabilize him. 

What should you do?
