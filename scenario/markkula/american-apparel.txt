“Passion, innovation & ethical practices for the clothing industry. That's American Apparel.”--From American Apparel’s website under “About Us”

American Apparel founder Dov Charney has never apologized for using sex to sell clothes.  In fact, it’s been central to his company’s strategy and marketing from Day One. He has also long acknowledged his personal behavior is strange and he is his own worst enemy.  

For example, 10 years ago, “Charney gave a now infamous interview with Claudine Ko, a reporter for Jane magazine, during which he masturbated, with her consent, while carrying on a conversation about business. He engaged in oral sex with an employee with Ko nearby, too” (Bloomberg Businessweek, July 9, 2014). Also, in 2006, American Apparel starting asking employees to sign a form indicating that they knew they were coming to work in a sexually charged environment.

According to board co-chairmen, in mid 2014, Charney was removed as chairman by the board pending termination following a 30-day notice clause in his contract.  The board first gave him the choice to resign if he gave up voting rights to his 27 percent share of the company. In that scenario, he would have received a four-year, multi-million dollar consulting contract.  Officially removed for violating the company’s sexual harassment policy and misusing company funds, Charney refused to go quietly, which threw the company’s ownership and governance into play. Hedge fund Standard General stepped in with a cash infusion for the company following a loan call by another investment firm after Charney’s ouster. Five of the seven board directors voluntarily agreed to step down, and Standard General agreed to add  three new directors. Charney stayed on as a strategic consultant but was eventually fired as CEO in December 2014.
