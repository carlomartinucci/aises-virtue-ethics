A new executive director is hired to lead a community nonprofit working with the homeless. The organization has an annual budget of $750,000 and a board of 20 people.  Two-thirds of the board has served for more than 15 years.

The executive director believes the nonprofit has the potential to raise more funds and serve more people.  However, the board is not engaged in moving the organization forward as demonstrated by, among other things, lack of attendance at board meetings and the fact that only six of the 20 board members attended the strategic planning board retreat.   The executive director is frustrated and staff morale is low.
