Neurodiverse college students are more than twice as likely to be assaulted than their neurotypical peers.[1]

A university’s sexual assault prevention center provides resources for what consent looks like in social situations. However, the descriptions are vague and contain phrasing such as describing positive consent as “using physical cues to let the other person know you’re comfortable taking things to the next level.” Neurodiverse individuals cannot easily identify these cues during social interactions. The sexual assault prevention center has not properly revised their materials to be concrete and specific, yet universally applicable.
