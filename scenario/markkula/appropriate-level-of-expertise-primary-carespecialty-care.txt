As a primary care physician, you have found your relationship with 24-year-old Peter both particularly challenging and particularly rewarding. When Peter first came to you at 18, after aging out of pediatric care, he was sullen and resentful, claiming he hated all doctors and “so- called helpers.” His pediatric records were incomplete and confusing. He has come to trust you over time, referring to you as “my good doc.” Peter is a skilled computer graphic designer with a stable job. Generally healthy, he has struggled with generalized depression and anxiety which you have treated with anti-depressants, with moderate success. Peter has always resisted your consistent advice to seek therapy from a psychologist or social worker to explore reflectively his patterns of depression and anxiety. Your impression of Peter’s family is that while unconventional, it is a loving and supportive family. Peter refers to his family as “my cool crazy family.” 

You are beginning to suspect, though you are not certain, that Peter may be experiencing the onset of bi-polar disorder. You do not feel qualified to evaluate, diagnose, or treat serious psychiatric disorders. You try to refer Peter to a psychiatrist for further evaluation, but he refuses. You share your concern that bi-polar disorder is one possibility, and one you would not be qualified to treat. But Peter steadfastly refuses to see a psychiatrist. He says: “You are my good doc. I trust you. You tell me what to do for this.” 

What should you do?
