At the age of eight, Kyle demonstrates exceptional academic abilities, consistently performing at the top of his class with scores in the 100th percentile across all subjects. However, he faces challenges in social interaction with peers and struggles with sleep problems that conflict with the traditional school schedule from 8:00AM to 2:00PM. Kyle has been observed to avoid eye contact, display repetitive behaviors, and show unusual interactions with the way things sound, smell, taste, look, or feel.

His doctor has told his parents that he may be on the autism spectrum. A one-to-one learning school named Eminent Scholars specializes in personalized education for students like Kyle, offering flexibility in scheduling and tailored learning experiences. This school could accommodate Kyle's sleep issues, allowing him to attend classes later in the day and learn at his own pace, potentially covering more content than in a traditional school setting. Kyleâ€™s parents, however, are concerned about the potential limitations in social interaction and available resources at Eminent Scholars. One-to-one learning means that Kyle would lack collaboration opportunities with peers where he could improve skills such as teamwork and communication. Decreased interaction could also lead to potential feelings of isolation.
