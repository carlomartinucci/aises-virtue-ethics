Ali is a deaf patient who comes in for an appointment and utilizes an American Sign Language translator. There is a standard amount of time for appointments with all patients. The physician only had 20 minutes for the appointment slot. When discussing a personal matter, the patient asks the translator to step out and instead wishes to communicate using pen and paper, as Ali is embarrassed about a sensitive health concern. Due to the limited time, the physician and patient only address one of the patient’s health concerns. It took 15 minutes for the sign language interpreter to arrive and then added time for Ali to write down his health concerns. Even though Ali had already written a list of six other problems on a paper in advance, the physician advises Ali to make a follow up appointment for his other concerns. Ali leaves the clinic feeling frustrated. One of the problems that was not addressed was his shortness of breath, and three months later he suffered a heart attack—the shortness of breath was actually a cardiac ischemia.
