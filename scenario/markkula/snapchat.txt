“Deletion should be the default.”--Snapchat’s mission statement

At the end of May 2014, details of sordid emails from Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel’s college days were released to the media. Trouble is, his college years were only four years prior to these emails being released, because, in 2014, he was only 24. The e-mails detailed illegal drug use, underage drinking, and misogynistic behavior, including urinating on one after she passed out following sex, and harassing women who he believed were overweight.  Some found elements of his emails racist as well.

Spiegel’s privileged background and lavish lifestyle had always  received plenty of press. After the email release, he began getting more press for his bad behavior than his app.  He apologized immediately following the release of the e-mails saying, “ I’m obviously mortified and embarrassed that my idiotic emails during my fraternity days were made public. I have no excuse. I’m sorry I wrote them at the time and I was a jerk to have written them.  They in no way reflect who I am today or my views towards women.” Spiegel remains CEO and was responsible for taking the company public in 2017.
