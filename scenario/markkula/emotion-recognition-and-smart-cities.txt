A large U.S. city that prides itself on its uptake of innovative technologies has deployed “smart” light posts with cameras at various locations within its boundaries. Representatives of a technology company contact city leaders and propose that they be granted access to video recordings captured by those cameras, in order to use emotion-recognition AI and generate reports that would give city administrators an ongoing real-time understanding of their constituents’ sentiments. The underlying footage would not be shared with other entities, and city leaders would be presented with aggregated reports that don’t identify any particular individuals from the videos.
