You are the head of your student governmentâ€™s Senate. This quarter, two senators have class during the scheduled Senate meeting time. Due to general availability and prescheduled events, the meeting time cannot change.

One senator is a senior, and must take the class to graduate. The second is a junior, on a strictly planned track for his bio-engineering major. Both are dedicated members of the organization, and although they tried, neither senator was able take a different section of the class. They will miss every Senate meeting, including all discussions, presentations, and votes, and will be unable to represent the concerns of their constituents for a full term. To prevent this, the official attendance policy only allows two absences, and after those two absences, the senators will be removed from their position; however, you know members of student government are students first.

How would do you reconcile the problem?
