Despite the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990 and Section 510 of the Rehabilitation Act in 2010, health care facilities such as examination tables, weight scales, diagnostic imaging equipment, and other equipment often remain inaccessible.[2]

A wheelchair user named Michelle comes into the clinic and is unable to move onto the exam table for the physical examination during her appointment. Due to the lack of staffing to help Michelle up on the table and time constraints, the physician decides to conduct the physical examination with the patient remaining in her wheelchair. Additionally, the physician assigned to Michelleâ€™s care has limited training in treating patients with mobility disabilities. The physician misses a sacral ulcer on her lower back, since Michelle remains in her wheelchair. Two months later, Michelle is admitted in the hospital with a stage three decubitus ulcer, requiring wound care, IV antibiotics for bacteremia (bacteria in the blood), and consultation with surgery.
