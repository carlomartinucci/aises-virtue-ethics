Matt, an employee at a major online gaming company, chose not to disclose his Autism Spectrum Diagnosis (ASD) due to past experiences with workplace discrimination. While off-duty and engaging in his companyâ€™s online gaming platform, Matt breached the company's sexual harassment policy by making an inappropriate comment towards a fellow female employee. The user reported the incident, leading to an in-house company trial where the company decided to terminate Matt's employment.

Two weeks following his termination, Matt decides to disclose his ASD to the company and seeks reinstatement to his previous position.
