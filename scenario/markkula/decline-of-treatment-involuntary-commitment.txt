Julia is an 18-year-old high school senior with a major depressive disorder. A teacher found her sitting in the school bathroom with an unopened bottle of powerful pain medication for which she does not have a prescription. When the teacher tried to speak with her about what is happening, she insisted, “I wasn’t going to do anything. Just leave me alone and pretend this never happened.” The school psychologist was called in and after evaluation expressed concerns about possible suicidal ideation. Julia, no longer a minor, did not want her parents called and would not commit to seeing her regular doctor, but reluctantly agreed to see you, a family practitioner certified in adolescent medicine, recommended by the school psychologist. Julia is surly but articulate. She claims treatment for her depression has always caused symptoms worse than the depression, and refuses to consider additional diagnostic tests or treatment options. She insists that though “everyone sometimes thinks of ending it” she wasn’t seriously considering suicide.
