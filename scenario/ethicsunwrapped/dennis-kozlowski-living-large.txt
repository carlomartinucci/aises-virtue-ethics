Dennis Kozlowski began his career at Tyco International in 1975 as an auditor and ascended to CEO in 1992. Under his leadership, Tyco experienced rapid growth through strategic mergers and acquisitions, completing 88 deals worth over $15 billion in his first six years as CEO. This aggressive expansion led to a soaring stock price as the company consistently exceeded Wall Street's expectations. However, when the economy slowed, Tyco began to struggle.

Kozlowski's tenure was also marked by an extravagant lifestyle. Allegations surfaced that Tyco paid for his $30 million New York apartment and personal expenses, including $1 million of a $2 million birthday party for his wife. Further scrutiny revealed unauthorized bonuses totaling $81 million and other large purchases and investments. In 2005, Kozlowski was convicted of crimes related to these unauthorized bonuses and other financial misconduct.

While many questioned his lifestyle, others questioned the trial and conviction. Commenting on the case, civil rights lawyer Dan Ackman wrote:

> “It’s fair to say that Kozlowski…abused many corporate prerogatives… Still, the larceny charges at the heart of the case did not depend on whether the defendants took the money—they did—but whether they were authorized to take it.”

Kozlowski asserted his innocence, stating:

> “There was no criminal intent here. Nothing was hidden. There were no shredded documents. All the information the prosecutors got was directly off the books and records of the company.”
