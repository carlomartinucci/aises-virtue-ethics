Key to Abramoff’s conviction were his lobbying efforts that began in the 1990s on behalf of Native American tribes seeking to establish gambling on reservations.\n\nIn 1996, Abramoff began working for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. With the help of Republican tax reform advocate Grover Norquist, and his political advocacy group Americans for Tax Reform, Abramoff defeated a Congressional bill that would have taxed Native American casinos. Texas Representative and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay also played a major role in the bill’s defeat. DeLay pushed the agenda of Abramoff’s lobbying clients in exchange for favors from Abramoff.\n\nIn 1999, Abramoff similarly lobbied to defeat a bill in the Alabama State Legislature that would have allowed casino-style games on dog racing tracks. This bill would have created competition for his clients’ casino businesses. Republican political activist Ralph Reed, and his political consulting firm Century Strategies, aided the effort by leading a grassroots campaign that rallied Alabama-based Christian organizations to oppose the bill.\n\nAs Abramoff’s successes grew, his clients, political contacts, and influence expanded. He hired aides and former staff of members of Congress. In 2001, Abramoff began working with Congressman DeLay’s former communications director, Michael Scanlon, who had formed his own public affairs consulting firm, Capitol Campaign Strategies. The Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana hired Abramoff and Capitol Campaign Strategies to help them renegotiate their gambling agreement with the State of Louisiana. Abramoff, however, did not disclose to the tribe that, in addition to his own consulting fees, he also received a portion of the fees paid to Scanlon’s firm.\n\nIn an effort to protect his Coushatta clients in Louisiana from competition by a new casino near Houston, Texas, Abramoff successfully lobbied for a state gambling ban in Texas between 2001 and 2002. Incidental to this ban was the closure of a casino in El Paso, Texas, owned by the Tigua Tribal Nation. The Tigua were another one of Abramoff’s casino clients.\n\nLater in 2002, Abramoff made a pitch to the Tigua to work to oppose the ban for which he had previously lobbied successfully. With the Tigua’s money, Abramoff took Ohio Representative Bob Ney and his staff on a golfing trip to Scotland. Abramoff hoped to convince Ney and his colleagues to slip a provision into an election-reform bill that would grant the Tigua gaming rights. Abramoff’s efforts did not pay off, and the deal he sought fell through, but he did not inform the Tigua of this outcome. Rather, Abramoff continued to give the Tigua hope for the provision’s success, while also continuing to charge them for his and Scanlon’s services. And, in their email exchanges, Abramoff and Scanlon often mocked their tribal clients as “morons” and “monkeys.”\n\nThroughout the course of their work with Native American tribes, Abramoff and Scanlon charged upwards of $66 million. The Coushatta paid over $30 million to protect their casino and to stop competing casinos in Texas. The Tigua paid $4.2 million to try to continue operating their casino in Texas. Abramoff has stated that he donated much of the money he made to charities, schools, and causes he believed in. But he also spent millions of dollars on activities or contributions in connection with politicians and campaigns he sought to influence. Furthermore, he evaded taxes by funneling money through nonprofit organizations with which he partnered.\n\nAfter his conviction in 2006, Abramoff cooperated in the investigation of his relationships with Congress members, including aides, business associates, government officials, and lawmakers. Representatives DeLay and Ney both stepped down from their positions in Congress. DeLay, who had risen to the rank of House Majority Leader, was charged with money laundering and conspiracy of funneling corporate contributions to state candidates. Ney plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and making false statements. In exchange for gifts, lavish trips, and political donations from Abramoff, DeLay and Ney had used their positions in Congress to grant favors to Abramoff’s clients and lobbying team. Abramoff served three and a half years of a six-year prison term. He was released on December 3, 2010.\n\nSince his release, Abramoff has spoken out against corruption in politics. He has stated that he believed himself to be a “moral lobbyist” and has apologized for his actions. In a 2011 interview, he said, “What’s legal in this system is the problem,” and in his memoir, he wrote, “Unfortunately, I was a miniature version of that system.” But not everyone perceived his redemption as a genuine effort.

People should pay more attention to the fact that we have got some enormous special interests in this country who are having incredible influences on policy.”\n\nIn his memoir, Abramoff reflected on personal and professional reform: “Regardless of my rationalizations, I was the one who didn’t disclose to my clients that there was a conflict of interest… I wasn’t the devil that the media were so quick to create, but neither was I the saint I always hoped to become. …I decided that, in order to move myself close to the angels, I would take what happened in my life, try to learn from it, and use it to educate others.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Given the scenario, I would work to ensure transparency and accountability in my lobbying efforts.

For instance, outlining concrete measures to ensure full disclosure of financial arrangements, developing clear protocols for handling conflicts of interest, implementing regular ethics training for staff, and establishing internal oversight mechanisms to monitor compliance with ethical standards would enhance the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Additionally, setting up a system for soliciting feedback from clients to assess their satisfaction and address any concerns promptly would demonstrate a proactive commitment to improving client relationships.\n\nMoreover, incorporating a plan for engaging with relevant stakeholders, such as industry associations, advocacy groups, and government agencies, to promote lobbying transparency and accountability on a broader scale would strengthen the impact of individual efforts. By collaborating with like-minded professionals and supporting legislative reforms that increase transparency in lobbying practices, the proposed actions can contribute to rebuilding trust and credibility in the lobbying profession.\n\nOverall, while the answer provides a solid foundation for ethical conduct in lobbying, further specificity and practicality in outlining actionable steps and collaboration strategies would enhance its effectiveness in fostering a culture of integrity and accountability in political advocacy."}]}

He was particularly interested in the causes of Crohn’s disease, an inflammatory bowel disease. After a fellowship at the University of Toronto, Wakefield became a lab researcher at the Royal Free Hospital in London in 1988.\n\nWakefield developed a theory that the measles virus caused Crohn’s disease and formed an “Inflammatory Bowel Disease Study Group.” In May of 1995, the distraught mother of an autistic child phoned Wakefield and suggested that her son’s condition had been caused by the measles virus in the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. Of interest to Wakefield was the fact that the child also apparently suffered from symptoms consistent with inflammatory bowel disease, which the mother suspected were also caused by the MMR vaccine. Wakefield and his team began to study the mother’s hypothesis. From July 1996 to February 1997, the team solicited referral letters from doctors of children who appeared to have both autism and inflammatory bowel issues. Ultimately, the team studied twelve children.\n\nOn February 28, 1998, the “team” published an article in the prestigious medical journal, The Lancet. The article listed twelve co-authors but was actually solely written by Wakefield. It proposed a potential link between the MMR vaccine and a bowel-brain “syndrome” causing both “regressive autism” (where children lost abilities such as speech that they had once had) and Crohn’s disease. Even before publication of the article, Wakefield had told the press that the results of his research “clearly confirm our suspicions.” At a press conference following publication, Wakefield said: “I cannot support the continued use of the three vaccines given together. My concerns are that one more case of this is too many.” The article attracted much publicity and had a significant effect on the public’s views regarding vaccination. What was unknown at that time included:\n\n- On February 19, 1996, Wakefield had agreed to be a well-paid consultant to attorney Richard Barr who had been awarded a contract by the British Legal Aid Board to potentially file a class action lawsuit over the MMR vaccine.\n\n- Barr and Wakefield had developed a list of things that Wakefield’s research needed to show in order to be helpful to Barr’s lawsuit even before the study began.\n\n- Barr largely funded Wakefield’s research project using government funds allocated to the lawsuit.\n\n- Many of the twelve children in the study had ties to Barr or to anti-vaccine groups; they had gone to the hospital with their parents already intent upon suing the vaccine makers.\n\n- To gather information for the study, Wakefield and his team subjected the twelve children to endoscopies, a procedure that was “high risk,” even though many of the children had no medical need for the procedure. Wakefield did not disclose that his team did not have ethics committee approval to perform these risky, unnecessary procedures.\n\n- In June 1996, Wakefield filed patent applications for:\n\n  - A single measles vaccine\n\n  - A treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, and\n\n  - A treatment for autism\n\n- Members of Wakefield’s research team often spoke giddily of the Nobel Prize they would win and Wakefield himself aspired to be the greatest gastroenterologist ever.\n\nWakefield had previously formed companies (1991, 1993, 1994) to commercially exploit his scientific discoveries, but none had succeeded. Nonetheless, soon after publication of The Lancet article, Wakefield met with potential investors to form a company to sell products (e.g., an alternative measles vaccine) that he planned to develop in this area. His projections for revenue and profit potential were aggressively optimistic, depending largely on Barr’s litigation succeeding. He negotiated to give the school a piece of his projected action in return for certain benefits, including a title for himself as “professor.” The school refused to give Wakefield that title.\n\nIn October of 1998, Barr filed the first court claims. Wakefield was to be Barr’s primary expert witness and pretended to be an independent scientist. In 1999, when shortcomings in Wakefield’s study came to light (very small number of subjects, subjects not chosen randomly, no comparison group of non-autistic children, heavy reliance on parents’ memories and beliefs, etc.), his university asked him to replicate his research results with a “gold standard” scientific study. Wakefield readily agreed to do so, but never even began such a study. Ultimately, he refused additional replication requests.\n\nIn 2000, Wakefield testified in Washington D.C. before a congressional committee regarding the dangers of the MMR vaccine. Another witness was John O’Leary, an Irish pathologist. Neither disclosed that they were business partners nor that O’Leary was also being supported financially by lawyer Barr. By October 2003, the flaws in Wakefield’s study were sufficiently apparent that Barr’s MMR lawsuit was dismissed for lack of evidence. The government money stopped flowing, but Barr and his staff had already received $51m in current U.S. dollars and Wakefield had received $846,000 in today’s dollars, plus expenses (roughly eight times his medical school salary).\n\nSoon thereafter, journalist Brian Deer — whose book *The Doctor Who Fooled the World* provides virtually all the material for this case study — began thoroughly investigating Wakefield and his research. As litigation involving Wakefield and his colleagues proceeded, documents related to Wakefield’s study in The Lancet came to light, showing that the article inaccurately described the conditions of every single one of the twelve subjects. Some were described as having autism when medical records showed that they did not. Some were described as having Crohn’s disease, when medical records showed that they did not. Others were described as having developed autism soon after having received the MMR vaccine, while medical records showed that they had manifested signs of autism before being vaccinated. And so on.\n\nAlthough the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals clearly require that third-party funding and expert witness work must be disclosed as conflicts of interest, Wakefield said that he did not agree. On May 3, 2004, 10 of 12 co-authors on The Lancet article repudiated the paper’s conclusions. Ultimately, after a long hearing, the General Medical Council canceled Wakefield’s medical registration.\n\nNone of this prevented Wakefield from becoming the darling of the anti-vaccine set and creating significant vaccine hesitancy regarding the MMR vaccine (and others).

Of interest to Wakefield was the fact that the child also apparently suffered from symptoms consistent with inflammatory bowel disease, which the mother suspected were also caused by the MMR vaccine. Wakefield and his team began to study the mother’s hypothesis. From July 1996 to February 1997, the team solicited referral letters from doctors of children who appeared to have both autism and inflammatory bowel issues. Ultimately, the team studied twelve children.\n\nOn February 28, 1998, the “team” published an article in the prestigious medical journal, The Lancet. The article listed twelve co-authors but was actually solely written by Wakefield. It proposed a potential link between the MMR vaccine and a bowel-brain “syndrome” causing both “regressive autism” (where children lost abilities such as speech that they had once had) and Crohn’s disease. Even before publication of the article, Wakefield had told the press that the results of his research “clearly confirm our suspicions.” At a press conference following publication, Wakefield said: “I cannot support the continued use of the three vaccines given together. My concerns are that one more case of this is too many.” The article attracted much publicity and had a significant effect on the public’s views regarding vaccination. What was unknown at that time included:\n\n- On February 19, 1996, Wakefield had agreed to be a well-paid consultant to attorney Richard Barr who had been awarded a contract by the British Legal Aid Board to potentially file a class action lawsuit over the MMR vaccine.\n\n- Barr and Wakefield had developed a list of things that Wakefield’s research needed to show in order to be helpful to Barr’s lawsuit even before the study began.\n\n- Barr largely funded Wakefield’s research project using government funds allocated to the lawsuit.\n\n- Many of the twelve children in the study had ties to Barr or to anti-vaccine groups; they had gone to the hospital with their parents already intent upon suing the vaccine makers.\n\n- To gather information for the study, Wakefield and his team subjected the twelve children to endoscopies, a procedure that was “high risk,” even though many of the children had no medical need for the procedure. Wakefield did not disclose that his team did not have ethics committee approval to perform these risky, unnecessary procedures.\n\n- In June 1996, Wakefield filed patent applications for:\n\n  - A single measles vaccine\n\n  - A treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, and\n\n  - A treatment for autism\n\n- Members of Wakefield’s research team often spoke giddily of the Nobel Prize they would win and Wakefield himself aspired to be the greatest gastroenterologist ever.\n\nWakefield had previously formed companies (1991, 1993, 1994) to commercially exploit his scientific discoveries, but none had succeeded. Nonetheless, soon after publication of The Lancet article, Wakefield met with potential investors to form a company to sell products (e.g., an alternative measles vaccine) that he planned to develop in this area. His projections for revenue and profit potential were aggressively optimistic, depending largely on Barr’s litigation succeeding. He negotiated to give the school a piece of his projected action in return for certain benefits, including a title for himself as “professor.” The school refused to give Wakefield that title.\n\nIn October of 1998, Barr filed the first court claims. Wakefield was to be Barr’s primary expert witness and pretended to be an independent scientist. In 1999, when shortcomings in Wakefield’s study came to light (very small number of subjects, subjects not chosen randomly, no comparison group of non-autistic children, heavy reliance on parents’ memories and beliefs, etc.), his university asked him to replicate his research results with a “gold standard” scientific study. Wakefield readily agreed to do so, but never even began such a study. Ultimately, he refused additional replication requests.\n\nIn 2000, Wakefield testified in Washington D.C. before a congressional committee regarding the dangers of the MMR vaccine. Another witness was John O’Leary, an Irish pathologist. Neither disclosed that they were business partners nor that O’Leary was also being supported financially by lawyer Barr. By October 2003, the flaws in Wakefield’s study were sufficiently apparent that Barr’s MMR lawsuit was dismissed for lack of evidence. The government money stopped flowing, but Barr and his staff had already received $51m in current U.S. dollars and Wakefield had received $846,000 in today’s dollars, plus expenses (roughly eight times his medical school salary).\n\nSoon thereafter, journalist Brian Deer — whose book *The Doctor Who Fooled the World* provides virtually all the material for this case study — began thoroughly investigating Wakefield and his research. As litigation involving Wakefield and his colleagues proceeded, documents related to Wakefield’s study in The Lancet came to light, showing that the article inaccurately described the conditions of every single one of the twelve subjects. Some were described as having autism when medical records showed that they did not. Some were described as having Crohn’s disease, when medical records showed that they did not. Others were described as having developed autism soon after having received the MMR vaccine, while medical records showed that they had manifested signs of autism before being vaccinated. And so on.\n\nAlthough the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals clearly require that third-party funding and expert witness work must be disclosed as conflicts of interest, Wakefield said that he did not agree. On May 3, 2004, 10 of 12 co-authors on The Lancet article repudiated the paper’s conclusions. Ultimately, after a long hearing, the General Medical Council canceled Wakefield’s medical registration.\n\nNone of this prevented Wakefield from becoming the darling of the anti-vaccine set and creating significant vaccine hesitancy regarding the MMR vaccine (and others). The result has been a rise in measles deaths around the world. As of 2022, Wakefield maintains his discredited theory and paints himself as the victim in all this.

In its modern Spanish style, bullfighting first became a prominent cultural event in the early 18th century. Yet despite its cultural significance, bullfighting continues to face increasing scrutiny in light of animal rights issues.\n\nSome people consider bullfighting a cruel sport in which the bull suffers a severe and tortuous death. Many animal rights activists often protest bullfighting in Spain and other countries, citing the needless endangerment of the bull and bullfighter. Some cities around the world where bullfighting was once popular, including Coslada (Spain), Mouans-Sartoux (France), and Teocelo (Mexico), have even declared themselves to be anti-bullfighting cities. Other places, including some towns in Catalonia (Spain), have ceased killing the bull in the fight, but continue bullfighting.\n\nTo other people, the spectacle of the bullfight is not mere sport. The event is not only culturally significant, but also a fine art in which the bullfighter is trained in a certain style and elicits emotion through the act of the fight. Writer Alexander Fiske-Harrison, in his research and training as a bullfighter, defends the practice and circumstances of the bull, “In terms of animal welfare, the fighting bull lives four to six years whereas the meat cow lives one to two. …Those years are spent free roaming…” And others similarly argue that the death of the bull in the ring is more humane than the death of animals in a slaughterhouse.

The school was in a run-down neighborhood three miles south of downtown that was plagued by armed robberies. Lewis himself had grown up in a violent neighborhood. He empathized with his students and was devoted to their success. A colleague described Lewis as a “star teacher” and a “very hard worker, who will go the extra mile.”\n\nLewis was a teacher when Beverly Hall was Atlanta’s school superintendent. Hall believed that business approaches and the values of the market system could save public education. She set accountability measures for the Atlanta school district and created performance objectives that were tougher than those of No Child Left Behind, the federal program that became law in 2002. Teacher evaluations were linked to students’ performance on standardized tests. Schools whose students did not make appropriate progress toward the standardized test goals received escalating sanctions that culminated in replacement of the faculty and staff, and restructuring or closing of the school.\n\nParks Middle School was in dire straits because it had been classified as “a school in need of improvement” for the previous five years.

Its students would be separated and bussed across town to different schools.\n\n“[It] was my sole obligation to never let that happen,” Lewis later told Rachel Aviv in an article about these events in The New Yorker. Lewis had pushed his students to work harder than they ever had in preparing for the test. But he knew that it would be very difficult for many of them to pass. Christopher Waller, the new principal of Parks, had heard that teachers in the elementary schools that fed into Parks had changed their students’ answers on the standardized tests under the guise of erasing stray pencil marks. Waller asked Lewis and other teachers to do the same. Lewis found the exams of students who needed to get a few more questions right in order to pass. He changed their answers. If he did not change their scores, Lewis feared that his students would lapse into “why try” attitudes. They would lose their neighborhood school and the community that had developed within it.\n\nThanks to Lewis and other teachers, Parks students did better than ever on the standardized tests. Neekisia Jackson, a former student at Parks at the time, recalled, “Everyone was jumping up and down,” after a teacher announced the school had met the goals of No Child Left Behind for the first time. Jackson continued, “We had heard what everyone was saying: ‘Y’all aren’t good enough.’ Now we could finally go to school with our heads held high.”\n\nThe same process of changing answers continued at Parks through 2010. By that time, nine other teachers were helping Lewis change answers.\n\nIn October of 2010, 50 agents of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation visited Parks and other Atlanta schools. The investigators concluded that teachers and administrators at 44 schools had cheated in the manner that Lewis had. In July of 2012, 110 teachers who had confessed or been accused of cheating were placed on administrative leave, including Lewis. Later that year, Lewis’ employment was terminated.\n\nThis case study is based on an article by Rachel Aviv entitled, “Wrong answer: In an era of high-stakes testing, a struggling school made a shocking choice,” that appeared in The New Yorker on July 21, 2014.

The Astros called it “Codebreaker.” One organization employee referred to the sign-stealing system that evolved as the “dark arts.”\n\nMLB rules allowed a runner standing on second base to do what he could to steal signs and relay them to the batter. But MLB rules strictly forbade using electronic means to decipher and signal signs. The Astros “Codebreaker” violated these rules.\n\nAccording to Wall Street Journal writer Jared Diamond:\n\n> The way Codebreaker worked was simple: Somebody would watch an in-game live feed and log the catcher’s signals into the spreadsheet, as well as the type of pitch that was actually thrown. With that information, Codebreaker determined how the signs corresponded with different pitches.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nIn baseball, catchers signal to pitchers which type of pitch to throw. Usually, catchers do this by holding down a certain number of fingers on their non-gloved hand between their legs as they crouch behind the plate. It is typically not as simple as just one finger for a fastball and two for a curve, but not a lot more complicated than that.\n\nIn September 2016, an intern for the Houston Astros major league baseball (MLB) team named Derek Vigoa showed Astros’ general manager Jeff Luhnow a PowerPoint presentation. It featured an Excel-based application programmed with an algorithm that could decode the pitching signs that opposing teams’ catchers flashed to their pitchers. The Astros called it “Codebreaker.” One organization employee referred to the sign-stealing system that evolved as the “dark arts.”\n\nMLB rules allowed a runner standing on second base to do what he could to steal signs and relay them to the batter. But MLB rules strictly forbade using electronic means to decipher and signal signs. The Astros “Codebreaker” violated these rules.\n\nAccording to Wall Street Journal writer Jared Diamond:\n\n> The way Codebreaker worked was simple: Somebody would watch an in-game live feed and log the catcher’s signals into the spreadsheet, as well as the type of pitch that was actually thrown. With that information, Codebreaker determined how the signs corresponded with different pitches. Once decided, that information would be communicated through intermediaries to a baserunner, who would relay them to the hitter.\n\n> Starting around June 2017, the system was embellished by Astros players. They started watching a live game feed on a monitor near the dugout and then would bang on a trash can to communicate the coming pitch to the batter. The “banging scheme” lasted through the 2017 World Series, which the Astros won over the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nLate in the 2017 season, MLB caught the Boston Red Sox relaying signs from their video room to an Apple watch worn by a trainer sitting in the dugout. Commissioner Rob Manfred fined the Red Sox and issued a strong warning to all teams against illegal electronic sign-stealing. It was suspected (accurately, as it turns out) that the New York Yankees had also been using technology to steal signs in 2015 and 2016. Despite these incidences, and the MLB warning, the Astros continue with “Codebreaker.”\n\nThe Astros’ scheme lasted into the 2018 season, in road games as well as home games, even though other teams were very suspicious that the Astros were stealing signs. Other teams often changed their own signs several times a game in an attempt to thwart the suspected sign stealing by the Astros. An executive for an opposing team was quoted as saying “The whole industry knows they’ve been cheating their asses off for three or four years. Everybody knew it.” Indeed, many teams had complained to MLB’s executives about the Astros’ cheating. Some suspect the cheating continued through the 2019 season, though others think not.\n\nFor the uninitiated, sign-stealing might not seem like it would give a big advantage. After all, even if a batter knows that a certain pitch is coming, he still has to hit it. It can’t be easy hitting a 100-mph fastball or a major league-caliber slider, even if you know it’s coming. Nonetheless, the advantage is substantial. According to the Washington Nationals’ pitching coach Paul Menhart, “It’s the worst feeling in the world stepping on that mound and having an idea that the hitter knows what’s coming. It’s one of the most unnerving feelings. You feel helpless. You just get ticked off to the point where you lose total focus and confidence.”\n\nThere is no question that many of the Astros players were actively involved in the scheme. The Astros manager, AJ Hinch, clearly knew about it. There is substantial, though perhaps not airtight evidence, that General Manager Rob Luhnhow also knew. Carlos Beltran, a Hall-of-Fame caliber player near the end of his 20-year playing career, was a leader in the scheme. Bench coach Alex Cora was a primary instigator. Owner Jim Crane appears not to have known of the dark arts being practiced by his club.\n\nThe scandal became public on November 12, 2019, when former Astros’ pitcher Mike Fiers blew the whistle in an interview published in “The Athletic.” MLB then launched an investigation that granted the Astros players immunity in return for their fessing up. Commissioner Rob Manfred soon issued a nine-page report that found that most of the Astros players knew of the scheme and many participated in it. The report also found that manager Hinch knew of the scheme and that GM Luhnow should have prevented it. Manfred suspended both Hinch and Luhnow, who were quickly fired by Astros’ owner Crane. MLB fined the Astros $5 million and stripped the club of its first- and second-round draft picks in both 2020 and 2021. Cora and Beltran lost managing jobs they had acquired.\n\nThe damage done by the Astros is significant. As veteran catcher Stephen Vogt said, “The integrity of our game is what we have, and now that’s been broken.” Former major-leaguer Doug Glanville concluded that MLB now faces an “existential crisis” saying that the Astros’ “selfish act makes everyone question the validity of the future and the truth of the past.” "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If I were a part of the Houston Astros organization during the time of the sign-stealing scheme, my specific actions would include:\n\n1.

First, the fact that a deal was struck at all was a major accomplishment, given the failure of previous climate change talks. Second, unlike previous climate change accords that focused exclusively on developed countries, this pact committed both developed and developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the voluntary targets established by nations in the Paris climate deal fall considerably short of what many scientists deem necessary to achieve the stated goal of the negotiations: limiting the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, since the established targets are voluntary, they may be lowered or abandoned due to political resistance, short-term economic crises, or simply social fatigue or disinterest.\n\nAs philosophy professor Stephen Gardiner aptly explains, the challenge of climate change presents the world with several fundamental ethical dilemmas. It is simultaneously a profoundly global, intergenerational, and philosophical problem. First, from a global perspective, climate change presents the world with a collective action problem: all countries have a collective interest in controlling global carbon emissions. But each individual country also has incentives to over-consume (in this case, to emit as much carbon as necessary) in response to societal demands for economic growth and prosperity.\n\nSecond, as an intergenerational problem, the consequences of actions taken by the current generation will have the greatest impact on future generations yet to be born. Thus, the current generation must forego benefits today in order to protect against possibly catastrophic costs in the future. This tradeoff is particularly difficult for developing countries. They must somehow achieve economic growth in the present to break out of a persistent cycle of poverty, while limiting the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted into the atmosphere to protect future generations. The fact that prosperous, developed countries (such as the U.S. and those in Europe) arguably created the current climate problems during their previous industrial economic development in the 19th and 20th centuries complicates the tradeoffs between economic development and preventing further climate change.\n\nFinally, the global and intergenerational nature of climate change points to the underlying philosophical dimensions of the problem. While it is intuitive that the current generation has some ethical responsibility to leave an inhabitable world to future generations, the extent of this obligation is less clear. The same goes for individual countries who have pledged to reduce carbon emissions to help protect environmental health, but then face real economic and social costs when executing those pledges. Developing nations faced with these costs may encounter further challenges as the impact of climate change will most likely fall disproportionally on the poor, thus also raising issues of fairness and inequality.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nArt Briles is without question one of the best high school football coaches in the history of Texas high school football. Starting as an assistant coach at a small town, his intelligence, drive, attention to detail, and creativity led him to head coaching jobs at larger and larger schools. He turned a floundering program at Stephenville High School into a powerhouse that won multiple state championships and intimidated even much larger high schools’ football teams.\n\nNot without ambition, Briles then took an assistant coaching job at Texas Tech University and soon became a successful head coach at the University of Houston. Then, he took the top job at Baylor University. Baylor is an “unambiguously Christian” university. Its website read (at the time): “In a world where faith is often the casualty of a serious pursuit of academic achievement, Baylor is a special case.” Baylor’s chancellor and president, Ken Starr, was an enthusiastic promoter of Christian values. Baylor’s athletic director, Ian McCaw, was described by former Clemson football coach Tommy Bowden as a “fine Christian man.”\n\nBriles seemed like a good fit for Baylor. As Briles often explains, his Christian faith is very important to him. A columnist wrote that Briles was “polite, courteous, and respectful in a way that harkens back to a different era. He is a good man with a good family.” Baylor used its Christian values, as embodied in its Christian leaders, as a lure to recruit students and student-athletes.\n\nIn 2008, Briles began as Baylor’s head football coach with the goal of ending a 12-year-string of losing records. It was a struggle during the first two years. But Briles’ recruiting ability, coaching acumen, and endless energy soon revived the dormant program. In 2010, Baylor had a winning record and went to its first of six straight bowl games. Soon after, Baylor became a team that was annually in the conversation for the nation’s best team. Baylor sent numerous players to the NFL and their quarterback, Robert Griffin III, won the Heisman trophy.\n\nOn the surface, all seemed well on the Baylor campus, especially at its brand-new $266 million football stadium. The campus was abuzz with energy and excitement over the football team’s success, which is not surprising in Texas. In 2013, Nick Eatman published *Art Briles: Looking Up: My Journey from Tragedy to Triumph*. And in 2014, Briles wrote and published an autobiography, *Beating Goliath: My Story of Football and Faith*.\n\nBut all was not well on the Baylor campus. In November 2014, Briles published his autobiography and the football team went 11-2. Baylor rose to as high as #4 in the national rankings. The same year, Patty Crawford was named Baylor’s first full-time Title IX coordinator. In her first two years in that role, Crawford received 400 reports of sexual harassment, violence, and assault. Seventeen of those victims made complaints of sexual assault or domestic violence against nineteen football players, including four alleged gang rapes. Crawford said that cases involving football players involved 10% of her caseload even though football players constituted only 4% of the student body. Lawsuits later alleged 52 rapes by 31 football players from 2011 to 2014.\n\nAccording to Paula Lavigne and Mark Schlabach in their book *Violated: Exposing Rape at Baylor University Amid College Football’s Sexual Assault Crisis*, Crawford said (regarding the gang rapes): “…the younger guys saw what was happening and that no one ever got in trouble for it, and the behavior continued. ‘It was just this weird mentality at Baylor that I haven’t seen anywhere else.’”\n\nThroughout Briles’ tenure at Baylor, women were assaulted by football players. Not much was done if these women complained to the university. This, of course, discouraged others from complaining so the incidents piled up.\n\nThe evidence indicates that Baylor’s chancellor Starr was largely unaware of what was going on. His fault lay primarily in not giving attention to ensuring that Baylor was meeting its Title IX obligations to police, investigate, and punish such wrongdoing. As president and chancellor, this was ultimately Starr’s obligation.\n\nBriles mostly claimed ignorance. He apologized to the board of regents for not knowing what was going on, although there was quite a bit of evidence that he did know. Many students and parents claimed to have made complaints to the football program. But Briles, who seemed to have a good memory when he wrote his autobiography, repeatedly said that he had no memory of complaints, messages, or conversations that victims claimed occurred. But e-mails and text messages surfaced which showed that Briles often knew of complaints and did his best to ensure that they were kept quiet rather than alert university officials in the Title IX office as he was supposed to do. Baylor’s athletic director McCaw sometimes did the same.\n\nIn one instance, a football player was arrested for assaulting and threatening to kill a male student (a non-athlete). In response, Briles and McCaw exchanged these messages:\n\n> **BRILES**: Just talked to [the player]—he said Waco PD was there—said they were going to keep it quiet—Wasn’t a set up deal… I’ll get shill [Baylor director of football operations Colin Shillinglaw] to ck on Sibley [a defense attorney often used by Baylor football players].\n>\n> **McCAW**: That would be great if they kept it quiet!\n\nWhen these cases began showing up in the press, Baylor could no longer play the silent game. The Board of Regents took charge and hired a law firm, Pepper Hamilton, to investigate. Its report was not pretty. Among other factual conclusions that the Board reached after reviewing the Pepper Hamilton report (which it refused to release to the public) were these:\n\n> Baylor failed to maintain effective oversight and supervision of the Athletics Department as it related to the effective implementation of Title IX. Leadership challenges and communication issues hindered enforcement of rules and policies, and created a cultural perception that football was above the rules….\n>\n> Baylor failed to take appropriate action to respond to reports of sexual assault and dating violence reportedly committed by football players. The choices made by football staff and athletics leadership, in some instances, posed a risk to campus safety and the integrity of the University. In certain instances, including reports of a sexual assault by multiple football players, athletics and football personnel affirmatively chose not to report sexual violence and dating violence to an appropriate administrator outside of athletics. In those instances, football coaches or staff met directly with a complainant and/or a parent of a complainant and did not report the misconduct. As a result, no action was taken to support complainants, fairly and impartially evaluate the conduct under Title IX, address identified cultural concerns within the football program or protect campus safety once aware of a potential pattern of sexual violence by multiple football players.\n\nIn addition, some football coaches and staff took improper steps in response to disclosures of sexual assault or dating violence that precluded the University from fulfilling its legal obligations. Football staff conducted their own untrained internal inquiries, outside of policy, which improperly discredited complainants and denied them the right to a fair, impartial and informed investigation, interim measures or processes promised under University Policy. In some cases, internal steps gave the illusion of responsiveness to complainants but failed to provide a meaningful institutional response under Title IX. Further, because reports were not shared outside of athletics, the University missed critical opportunities to impose appropriate disciplinary action that would have removed offenders from campus and possibly precluded future acts of sexual violence against Baylor students. In some instances, the football program dismissed players for unspecified team violations and assisted them in transferring to other schools….\n\nIn addition to the failures related to sexual assault and dating violence, individuals within the football program actively sought to maintain internal control over discipline for other forms of misconduct. Athletics personnel failed to recognize the conflicts of interest in roles and the risk to campus safety by insulating athletes from student conduct processes. Football coaches and staff took affirmative steps to maintain internal control over discipline of players and to actively divert cases from the student conduct or criminal processes. In some cases, football coaches and staff had inappropriate involvement in disciplinary and criminal matters or engaged in improper conduct that reinforced an overall perception that football was above the rules, and that there was no culture of accountability for misconduct.\n\nThe regents ultimately fired or forced the resignations of Starr, McCaw, and Briles.

Starting as an assistant coach at a small town, his intelligence, drive, attention to detail, and creativity led him to head coaching jobs at larger and larger schools. He turned a floundering program at Stephenville High School into a powerhouse that won multiple state championships and intimidated even much larger high schools’ football teams.\n\nNot without ambition, Briles then took an assistant coaching job at Texas Tech University and soon became a successful head coach at the University of Houston. Then, he took the top job at Baylor University. Baylor is an “unambiguously Christian” university. Its website read (at the time): “In a world where faith is often the casualty of a serious pursuit of academic achievement, Baylor is a special case.” Baylor’s chancellor and president, Ken Starr, was an enthusiastic promoter of Christian values. Baylor’s athletic director, Ian McCaw, was described by former Clemson football coach Tommy Bowden as a “fine Christian man.”\n\nBriles seemed like a good fit for Baylor. As Briles often explains, his Christian faith is very important to him. A columnist wrote that Briles was “polite, courteous, and respectful in a way that harkens back to a different era. He is a good man with a good family.” Baylor used its Christian values, as embodied in its Christian leaders, as a lure to recruit students and student-athletes.\n\nIn 2008, Briles began as Baylor’s head football coach with the goal of ending a 12-year-string of losing records. It was a struggle during the first two years. But Briles’ recruiting ability, coaching acumen, and endless energy soon revived the dormant program. In 2010, Baylor had a winning record and went to its first of six straight bowl games. Soon after, Baylor became a team that was annually in the conversation for the nation’s best team.

And in 2014, Briles wrote and published an autobiography, *Beating Goliath: My Story of Football and Faith*.\n\nBut all was not well on the Baylor campus. In November 2014, Briles published his autobiography and the football team went 11-2. Baylor rose to as high as #4 in the national rankings. The same year, Patty Crawford was named Baylor’s first full-time Title IX coordinator. In her first two years in that role, Crawford received 400 reports of sexual harassment, violence, and assault. Seventeen of those victims made complaints of sexual assault or domestic violence against nineteen football players, including four alleged gang rapes. Crawford said that cases involving football players involved 10% of her caseload even though football players constituted only 4% of the student body. Lawsuits later alleged 52 rapes by 31 football players from 2011 to 2014.\n\nAccording to Paula Lavigne and Mark Schlabach in their book *Violated: Exposing Rape at Baylor University Amid College Football’s Sexual Assault Crisis*, Crawford said (regarding the gang rapes): “…the younger guys saw what was happening and that no one ever got in trouble for it, and the behavior continued. ‘It was just this weird mentality at Baylor that I haven’t seen anywhere else.’”\n\nThroughout Briles’ tenure at Baylor, women were assaulted by football players.

This approach prioritizes the well-being and safety of individuals affected by the misconduct.\n\nHowever, it would be beneficial to also emphasize the importance of supporting and providing resources for the victims of sexual assault in this situation. Ensuring that they receive proper care, support, and justice is crucial in addressing the harm caused. Additionally, promoting a culture of transparency, accountability, and proper reporting mechanisms within institutions is essential to prevent such misconduct from being overlooked or silenced in the future."}]}

Mendenhall’s tweets resulted in a spike from 13,621 to 36,914 in his Twitter “followers” and a backlash from people who found his statement inappropriate or offensive. Many called for a “full and complete apology,” and the athletic company Champion dropped him as an endorser, stating that he would not be able to “appropriately represent Champion.” Champion further explained Mendenhall’s statements reflected values inconsistent with those of the brand, and “Champion is a strong supporter of the government’s efforts to fight terrorism and is very appreciative of the dedication and commitment of the U.S. Armed Forces.” Because of his relationship to the Steelers, the team’s president, Art Rooney, also issued a response, stating, “I have not spoken with Rashard so it is hard to explain or even comprehend what he meant with his recent Twitter comments. The entire Steelers’ organization is very proud of the job our military personnel have done and we can only hope this leads to our troops coming home soon.”\n\nTo his critics the athlete explained, “This controversial statement was something I said in response to the amount of joy I saw in the event of a murder. I don’t believe that this is an issue of politics or American pride; but one of religion, morality, and human ethics.” Nevertheless, he did issue an apology in a later tweet, stating “I apologize for the timing as such a sensitive matter, but it was not meant to do harm.” He also wrote, “I apologize to anyone I unintentionally harmed with anything that I said, or any hurtful interpretation that was made and put to my name.” Although Mendenhall argues that he was just trying to provoke conversation and “encourage anyone reading it to think,” ESPN.com reporter James Walker describes him as “the latest example of a player needing to use restraint before posting his thoughts on Twitter.”\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this scenario, I would advise Rashard Mendenhall to carefully consider the potential implications of his social media posts before sharing them online. Specifically, I would recommend that he:\n\n1. Take a moment to reflect on the sensitivity of the topic at hand, especially when it involves a significant event like the death of Osama Bin Laden.\n2. Consider the diverse perspectives and reactions that his audience may have to his posts, particularly given his status as a public figure.\n3. Consult with a trusted advisor or PR professional to review his posts before sharing them to ensure they are respectful and considerate of different viewpoints.\n4. Craft his messages thoughtfully to convey his intended message clearly and avoid misunderstandings or misinterpretations.\n5. Be prepared to address any backlash or criticism that may arise from his posts by responding in a calm and respectful manner.\n\nBy following these steps, Mendenhall can navigate the challenges of social media as a public figure more effectively and responsibly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is the answer ethical?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The response provided is fairly ethical and offers practical advice for Rashard Mendenhall in managing his social media presence as a public figure. It emphasizes the importance of reflection, considering diverse perspectives, seeking guidance, clear communication, and handling criticism professionally. These actionable steps can help Mendenhall navigate sensitive topics and controversial issues on social media more responsibly.\n\nHowever, one potential improvement could be to suggest that Mendenhall engage in more proactive communication strategies, such as issuing statements or engaging in dialogue before controversial topics arise. This could help him establish a clearer understanding of his values and intentions with his online presence, potentially avoiding misunderstandings in the future.\n\nOverall, the response addresses the specific situation well and provides actionable steps for Mendenhall to improve his social media presence as a public figure."}]}

Millions of Americans have sent their DNA to commercial testing companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry to learn more about their heritage or potential for disease. According to Grand View Research, “the global DNA testing market is set to reach over $10 billion by 2022.” (Brown 2018). Successful marketing campaigns have led consumers to believe that home DNA testing is fun, informative, and personal to them. However, what consumers may not realize is that once their genetic information is shared, they have limited control as to who has access to it.\n\nRegardless of the reason consumers decide to purchase a home DNA test kit, the information they provide to the testing company is far greater than the information they receive. The benefits that these testing companies can gain from gathering, using, and selling customers’ private information places them in a significant conflict-of-interest situation. Some of this information includes the IP address, name, address, email, and family history, collected from the application, as well as information provided on follow up surveys. Furthermore, according to its website, if customers opt to share their data for research, 23andMe could keep their physical spit sample and the genetic data it contains for up to a decade. Additional information that consumers upload to the companies’ genealogy website, such as pictures, obituaries, family relationships, and even third-party information is probably added to the pool of data linked to customers’ DNA.\n\nRecently, some have felt that privacy and consumer rights have been violated when they used home DNA kits. In June 2019, Lori Collett sued Ancestry for allegedly misleading customers about what it was doing with their DNA. This class action lawsuit claims that personal information was released to outside parties without customer consent.

The fine print may not accurately spell out what the company, its third-party associates, and collaborators can or will do with customer information. (Merken, 2019)\n\nFurther concerns arise as testing companies often align themselves with pharmaceutical companies, public and private research organizations, and Google. For example, “GlaxoSmithKline purchased a $300 million stake in the company, allowing the pharmaceutical giant to use 23andMe’s trove of genetic data to develop new drugs — and raising new privacy concerns for consumers.” (Ducharme, 2018) Similarly, Ancestry is sharing its data with Google through its research subsidiary Calico. Ancestry admits that “once they share people’s genetic information with partner companies, they can’t be responsible for security protocols of those partners.” (Leavenworth, 2018).\n\nAdditionally, both 23andMe and Ancestry use Google Analytics to provide third parties with consumer information for targeted marketing. In its privacy policy 23andMe states that “when you use our Services, including our website or mobile app(s), our third-party service providers may collect Web-Behavior Information about your visit, such as the links you clicked on, the duration of your visit, and the URLs you visited.” This use of shared information allows testing services and third parties to build a comprehensive personal profile on you, which may include your genetic information.\n\nAlthough privacy may be a concern of consumers, law enforcement with the cooperation of DNA testing companies, either through partnership or warrants, have brought justice to the victims of numerous unsolved cases. Over the past few years, the use of consumer DNA databases have closed many high profile cold cases such as the Golden State Killer and overturned the wrongful conviction of Alfred Swinton.

Furthermore, according to its website, if customers opt to share their data for research, 23andMe could keep their physical spit sample and the genetic data it contains for up to a decade. Additional information that consumers upload to the companies’ genealogy website, such as pictures, obituaries, family relationships, and even third-party information is probably added to the pool of data linked to customers’ DNA.\n\nRecently, some have felt that privacy and consumer rights have been violated when they used home DNA kits. In June 2019, Lori Collett sued Ancestry for allegedly misleading customers about what it was doing with their DNA. This class action lawsuit claims that personal information was released to outside parties without customer consent. Further contentions include that the waiver of consumer rights through consent forms is often vague, general in scope, and ever-changing. The fine print may not accurately spell out what the company, its third-party associates, and collaborators can or will do with customer information. (Merken, 2019)\n\nFurther concerns arise as testing companies often align themselves with pharmaceutical companies, public and private research organizations, and Google. For example, “GlaxoSmithKline purchased a $300 million stake in the company, allowing the pharmaceutical giant to use 23andMe’s trove of genetic data to develop new drugs — and raising new privacy concerns for consumers.” (Ducharme, 2018) Similarly, Ancestry is sharing its data with Google through its research subsidiary Calico. Ancestry admits that “once they share people’s genetic information with partner companies, they can’t be responsible for security protocols of those partners.” (Leavenworth, 2018).\n\nAdditionally, both 23andMe and Ancestry use Google Analytics to provide third parties with consumer information for targeted marketing. In its privacy policy 23andMe states that “when you use our Services, including our website or mobile app(s), our third-party service providers may collect Web-Behavior Information about your visit, such as the links you clicked on, the duration of your visit, and the URLs you visited.” This use of shared information allows testing services and third parties to build a comprehensive personal profile on you, which may include your genetic information.\n\nAlthough privacy may be a concern of consumers, law enforcement with the cooperation of DNA testing companies, either through partnership or warrants, have brought justice to the victims of numerous unsolved cases. Over the past few years, the use of consumer DNA databases have closed many high profile cold cases such as the Golden State Killer and overturned the wrongful conviction of Alfred Swinton. In some cases, such as the Golden State Killer, the DNA used to identify suspects are cross-referenced through the DNA of relatives as far removed as third cousins. However, this has brought additional concerns, as a DNA expert for the American Civil Liberties Union, Vera Eidelman states, “There’s always a danger that things will be used beyond their initial targets, beyond their initial purpose.” (St. John 2019)\n\nThe success of consumer DNA databases has led some law enforcement to meet with Bennett Greenspan, the CEO of FamilyTreeDNA, seeking his help to convince consumers to share their genetic data with police. This partnership has resulted in the creation of the non-profit Institute for DNA Justice that has the following stated mission:\n\n> “The Institute for DNA Justice was formed to educate the public about the value of investigative genetic genealogy (IGG) as a revolutionary new tool to identify, arrest, and convict violent criminals, deter violent crime, exonerate the innocent, encourage the 26 million Americans who have taken a DNA test to become genetic witnesses by participating in publicly available family-matching databases working with law enforcement using IGG, and to promote the adoption of industry leading best practices guidelines surrounding its use by law enforcement agencies around the country.”\n\nRegardless of public or private testing, laws in the United States have not yet determined a standard for the home DNA testing industry. "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would inform consumers about the potential privacy risks associated with home DNA testing kits, emphasizing the importance of thoroughly reviewing the privacy policies and terms of service of the testing companies before submitting their genetic information. Additionally, I would recommend that consumers take necessary precautions, such as limiting the information they provide, opting out of data sharing for research purposes, and being cautious about uploading additional personal data to genealogy websites linked to their DNA results. Furthermore, I would suggest that consumers consider the long-term implications of sharing their genetic information with testing companies, especially in light of potential collaborations with pharmaceutical companies, public and private research organizations, and third-party entities."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is the answer ethical?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer provided is ethical as it prioritizes consumer awareness and protection regarding the potential privacy risks associated with home DNA testing kits. By advising consumers to thoroughly review privacy policies and terms of service, the response empowers individuals to make informed decisions about sharing their genetic information.

The activist explained her act of defiance, stating, “because it was the right thing to do and it was time for somebody to step up. Do the right thing. We have to bury hate; it’s been too long.” South Carolina Representative Jenny Anderson Horne, an ancestor of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis, argued that the Confederate flag should no longer fly in front of the State House. She chastised her colleagues in an emotional speech, stating:\n\n> “I cannot believe that we do not have the heart in this body to do something meaningful—such as take a symbol of hate off these grounds on Friday.”\n\nOn the other hand, Confederate sympathizers contend that the flag is a symbol of historical pride, not of hatred. They claim that efforts to remove the flag are a misplaced reaction to photos of Dylann Roof posing with a Confederate flag. Roof had been recently charged with the racially motivated killing of nine black people in a Charleston church. South Carolina State Senator Lee Bright noted that symbols have been misused throughout history. Bright said, for example, that he believed the Ku Klux Klan abused the symbol of the cross, but there has not been a push to remove all crosses. Similarly, Kenneth Thrasher, the lieutenant commander of the Sons of the Confederate Veterans, urged decision makers not to act in haste. Thrasher stated:\n\n> “The flag didn’t kill anybody. It was a deranged young man who did.” "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As a helpful assistant, I would facilitate open and respectful dialogue between the different groups involved in the debate surrounding the Confederate flag's display. I would organize community forums or town hall meetings where individuals with varying perspectives can express their viewpoints and engage in constructive conversations. This would provide a platform for listening to each other's concerns, educating one another on the historical significance of the flag, and finding common ground for moving forward in a unified manner. By promoting understanding and empathy through dialogue, we can work towards a solution that respects the complex historical context while also addressing present-day concerns about symbols of hate and division."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is the answer ethical?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer provided suggests facilitating open and respectful dialogue between the different groups involved in the debate surrounding the Confederate flag's display.

Promoting understanding and empathy through dialogue can indeed be effective in addressing the complexities of the issue and working towards a solution that respects historical context while also addressing present-day concerns about symbols of hate and division.\n\nHowever, the evaluation could be improved by emphasizing the need for concrete actions to follow the dialogue. While dialogue is a crucial first step, it should be followed by tangible steps such as policy changes, removal or relocation of symbols, or educational initiatives to ensure that the discussions lead to meaningful outcomes. It would also be beneficial to highlight the importance of actively listening to marginalized voices and prioritizing the well-being and safety of communities affected by the symbols in question. Additionally, addressing power dynamics within the dialogue process and ensuring that all parties have an equal opportunity to participate and be heard is essential for a truly inclusive and productive conversation.\n\nOverall, the suggested approach of fostering dialogue is a positive step in addressing the contentious issue of Confederate symbols, but it should be supplemented with concrete actions and a focus on equity and justice in the process."}]}

These offenses included verbal, emotional, and physical abuse.\n\nAt Yale University, administrators sent an email to students advising them to avoid racially insensitive Halloween costumes, such as those featuring blackface or mock Native American headdresses. Controversy arose when Erika Christakis, a white lecturer of early childhood education and associate master at one of the university’s residential colleges, emailed the students she oversaw, objecting to the call for sensitivity. Christakis questioned what she described as an “institutional… exercise of implied control over college students,” asking, “Is there no room anymore for a child or young person to be a little bit obnoxious… a little bit inappropriate or provocative or, yes, offensive?” In response, many students signed an open letter to Christakis, stating:\n\n> “We are not asking to be coddled… [We] simply ask that our existences not be invalidated on campus. This is us asking for basic respect of our cultures and our livelihoods.”\n\nDuring a protest, a student confronted Christakis’s husband, Nicholas Christakis, a professor at Yale and master of one of the residential colleges. The students told him to step down, asserting that being a master was “not about creating an intellectual space… [but] creating a home here.”\n\nAt the University of Missouri, administrators were criticized for their slow and ineffective responses to ongoing racial tensions on campus. After Payton Head, a Black student and president of the Missouri Student Association, was taunted with racial slurs, it took university chancellor R. Bowen Loftin nearly a week to respond. Following this and other incidents, students organized rallies and demonstrations. Tensions escalated after someone used feces to smear a swastika on a communal bathroom in a residence hall. This act of vandalism became the final straw for graduate student Jonathan Butler, who had led or been involved in many demonstrations up to that point. He decided to go on an indefinite hunger strike until university system president Tim Wolfe was removed from office.

Student photographer Tim Tai, on assignment for ESPN, was surrounded and confronted by protesters, including university staff members, who did not want any media to enter what they said was a “safe space.” Tai was attempting to document the protests in public spaces, stating:\n\n> “This is the First Amendment that protects your right to stand here and mine. …The law protects both of us.”\n\nA video capturing the confrontation went viral and sparked wider debate over the issue of freedom of speech in the protests at Missouri, Yale, and other college campuses. Journalists, commentators, and academics raised discussions over the roles of free speech, deliberation, and tolerance in the dialogue between student activists and university administrators.\n\nFreelance journalist Terrell Jermaine Starr, in defense of the protesters, wrote:\n\n> “This wasn’t a problem with Tai’s character or his journalistic integrity; he was doing his job… but reporters should also feel a responsibility to try to understand and respect [the protesters’] pain…”\n\nStarr continued:\n\n> “In many communities that historically have been marginalized and unfairly portrayed by the media, there’s good reason people do not trust journalists: They often criminalize black people’s pain and resistance to racial oppression.”\n\nSuzanne Nossel, executive director of PEN American Center, defended free speech as a crucial driver of social justice reform:\n\n> “[Without] free speech, the ‘safe spaces’ students crave will soon suffocate them. Social movements must evolve or they die. Ideological and even tactical evolution demands willingness to hear out heterodoxy.

Free speech is essential to that quest.”\n\nWriting about the Yale incident, journalist Conor Friedersdorf suggested that the student activists’ intolerance of other views could lead to censorship.

Some felt entitled to something more, and that is what prolonged the debate.” Op-ed columnist Nicholas Kristof addressed the broader role of freedom of speech on college campuses:\n\n> “The protesters at Mizzou and Yale and elsewhere make a legitimate point: Universities should work harder to make all students feel they are safe and belong. Members of minorities—whether black or transgender or (on many campuses) evangelical conservatives—should be able to feel a part of campus, not feel mocked in their own community.”\n\nPolitical theorist Danielle Allen, on the other hand, described the debate over freedom of speech as a distraction from the key issues of the protests.

Clinical social workers are the largest professional group providing mental health services in the United States, providing services in urban and rural outpatient and inpatient settings. Social workers are seen as different from clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and other occupational groups that provide therapy in the emphasis that social work places on social justice, cultural competence, and respect for diversity. According to the National Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics, the social work profession requires its members to:\n\n> “[A]ct to prevent and eliminate…discrimination against any person, group, or class on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, color, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, political belief, religion, or mental or physical disability.”\n\nAn ethical dilemma may arise when the religious or moral beliefs of the social worker interfere with the duty of all health care professionals to provide optimal service to clients and to “do no harm.” This issue made national headlines in a related context, when Kim Davis, a clerk in Rowan County, Kentucky, was jailed after defying a federal court order to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. Her action was based on her contention that to do so would violate her religious beliefs. In his ruling, Judge David L. Bunning of the United States District Court stated:\n\n> “If you give people the opportunity to choose which orders they follow, that’s what potentially causes problems.”\n\nIn defense of Davis, Ryan Anderson of the Heritage Foundation wrote:\n\n> “Ms. Davis felt she had to follow her conscience… That, after all, is what religious freedom and religious accommodations are all about: creating the space for citizens to fulfill their duties, as they understand them, to God—regardless of what the rest of us think.”\n\nA similar conflict between religious faith and the requirements of one’s job or one’s profession may be seen in social work practice in the following scenario:\n\nA clinical social worker has been treating a 25-year-old man for depression and anxiety.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nThe Animal Foundation operates Nevada’s largest open-admission animal shelter, the Lied Animal Shelter and pet adoption center, located in Las Vegas. Funded by taxpayers, grants, and individual donors, the shelter provides refuge for thousands of lost, unwanted, neglected, and abandoned animals annually.\n\nIn recent years, the Lied Animal Shelter faced significant challenges due to overcrowding, attributed to a surge in animal intake as residents in the greater Las Vegas area (Clark County) surrendered or lost their pets. Analysts believed that the 2008 recession was a major contributing factor to pet abandonment. April Corbin, writing for *Las Vegas Weekly*, reported:\n\n> “The Las Vegas Valley has a problem with domestic animals: we have more than we seem able or willing to handle, and those without homes mostly end up at the Lied Shelter. On any given day, it may be the busiest animal holding facility in the nation. …Some blame the recession, which led to the foreclosures of more than 150,000 homes in Clark County between January 2007 and May 2014, triggering the wholesale abandonment of animals.”\n\nIn 2013, the Lied Animal Shelter took in over 40,000 abandoned or lost animals. Of these, more than 10,000 were adopted, nearly 5,000 were reunited with their owners, and over 2,500 were transferred to other facilities. However, 21,000 animals—more than half of those brought to the shelter—were euthanized. Many in Clark County were discouraged by the seemingly insurmountable problems the shelter faced.\n\nLeaders at R&R Partners, a full-service international advertising agency headquartered in Las Vegas, believed their persuasive communication skills could help address the Animal Foundation’s challenges. R&R took on the nonprofit as a pro bono client with goals of promoting pet ownership and driving traffic to the Animal Foundation’s pet adoption website, NewPetNow.com. The agency conducted qualitative research through focus groups with R&R employees who were pet owners. They developed a strategy to frame pet adoption not about love and companionship but about pets’ many household uses (e.g., alarm system, sleeping mask, vacuum cleaner) with a tongue-in-cheek tone. The agency created an integrated communication campaign of “In-FUR-mercial” spoofs that portrayed pets as multi-purpose products for the home. Examples of the “Pet Dog” and “Pet Cat” In-FUR-mercials are available online.\n\nAfter the release of the ads in early 2015, the campaign received critical acclaim from industry analysts. *ADWEEK* contributor Gabriel Beltrone stated, “The writing is sharp and funny, the acting perfectly overdone, and the voiceover as cheesy as possible—dead-on parody.” The In-FUR-mercials also received CynopsisMedia’s award for the Best 30-Second Spot.\n\nThe campaign resonated with audiences in Las Vegas and generated positive press for the Animal Foundation and the Lied Shelter, helping them achieve their goal of increasing pet adoption. The percentage of available pets adopted increased by 9.39 percent during 2015, resulting in more than 1,000 additional animals being adopted.\n\nLeaders at R&R Partners acknowledged that the campaign also brought important benefits to the agency beyond the success and visibility of the campaign. Morale and camaraderie within the agency were enhanced, and the agency’s reputation as a responsible corporate citizen was reinforced. Sarah Catletti, an account supervisor at R&R Partners, described the benefits to the agency:\n\n> “Welcoming the Animal Foundation to R&R Vegas’ list of clients was a great way to boost morale within the agency. The pro bono client was chosen through an employee voting system.

Examples of the “Pet Dog” and “Pet Cat” In-FUR-mercials are available online.\n\nAfter the release of the ads in early 2015, the campaign received critical acclaim from industry analysts. *ADWEEK* contributor Gabriel Beltrone stated, “The writing is sharp and funny, the acting perfectly overdone, and the voiceover as cheesy as possible—dead-on parody.” The In-FUR-mercials also received CynopsisMedia’s award for the Best 30-Second Spot.\n\nThe campaign resonated with audiences in Las Vegas and generated positive press for the Animal Foundation and the Lied Shelter, helping them achieve their goal of increasing pet adoption. The percentage of available pets adopted increased by 9.39 percent during 2015, resulting in more than 1,000 additional animals being adopted.\n\nLeaders at R&R Partners acknowledged that the campaign also brought important benefits to the agency beyond the success and visibility of the campaign.

It features high-speed collisions between human beings, at least one of whom is often very large. Broken bones, torn ligaments, and even occasional paralysis can result. But it is the research on brain injuries that has caused many people to claim football is immoral and to advocate that it be banned. Such calls have gained the attention and opposition of the National Football League (NFL) given the high popularity and profitability of football as a spectator sport.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as “a disruption in the normal function of the brain that can be caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head, or penetrating head injury.” A concussion is a form of TBI where the blow causes the brain to move rapidly back and forth, bouncing around in the skull and suffering various types of structural damage. Although concussions can carry serious consequences, they are termed a “mild” form of TBI because they are not typically life-threatening. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), says the Mayo Clinic, is “brain degeneration likely caused by repeated head traumas.” Repetitive head impacts (RHIs) can cumulatively lead to CTE and early death, even though no single RHI results in a concussion.\n\nIf only one thing is clear about the current science surrounding sports-related concussions (SRCs) and their related brain injuries, it’s that very little is certain about the current science. The field is surprisingly new. A significant scientific breakthrough occurred in 2002 when an African-American neuropathologist in Pittsburgh named Bennet Omalu (played by Will Smith in the 2015 movie Concussion) performed an autopsy on Hall of Fame center Mike Webster. Dr. Omalu identified abnormal clumps of the protein tau in Webster’s brain, which he believed to be evidence of CTE. Such proteins develop in tangles that slowly strangle neurons and, consequently, inhibit brain function.\n\nMany studies point to how dangerous football is to players’ long-term brain health. Although there is also research related to college players and younger, this case study focuses on the NFL. The studies show:\n\n- Over two regular seasons (2012-2014), NFL players sustained 4,384 injuries, including 301 concussions. This statistic is up 61% from 2002-2007, perhaps reflecting an improvement of awareness and reporting (Lawrence et al. 2015).\n\n- In a study of 14,000 NFL players, researchers found that even head impacts insufficient to cause concussions can mount up over the years, leading to CTE and premature death. An NFL player who plays 24 games increases the likelihood of premature death by 16% (Ehrlich et al., 2019).\n\n- A 2019 study of the brains of 223 football players with CTE and 43 players without CTE found that for each additional 2.6 years of play, the risk of developing CTE doubled (Mex et al. 2019).\n\nGiven the results of these studies, there has been a strong outcry against football, including at the NFL level. The NFL initially pushed back against the implications of such research. Then, as evidence piled up, the NFL funded research itself about head injuries and also how to design safer equipment. And, the NFL made rule changes in an attempt to make the game safer. The NFL has also changed rules to discourage helmet-to-helmet contact, and instituted protocols for safely returning concussed players to the field.\n\nDespite these changes, controversy continues because the science in this area is not settled. Importantly, standard medical imaging techniques do not show brain damage even when a player has had a concussion. And CTE cannot truly be diagnosed until the brain is examined after death.\n\nNeuropsychologist Munro Cullum argues: “I worry the pendulum has swung too far. The reality is that we still don’t know who is most likely to suffer a concussion, who will take longer to recover, how anatomic or genetic differences influence concussions, and who may be at risk of prolonged symptoms or developing cognitive problems later in life.”\n\nSome studies seem to indicate that concussions may be more benign than feared. For example:\n\n- A 2016 study found no elevated risk of suicide in a population of players with at least five years in the league (Lehman et al., 2016).\n\n- Another study of 35 former NFL players over age 50 who had sustained multiple concussions during their careers found no significant association between the length of careers, the number of concussions, and their level of cognitive function later in life (Mez et al., 2019).\n\n- A 2007 study found that retired NFL players experienced levels of depressive symptoms no worse than those of the general population (Schwenk, 2007).\n\nSo, at the end of the day, the jury still seems to be out on the question of whether or not we can go to a football game or watch one on television and still feel good about ourselves for supporting a sport that arguably causes irreversible traumatic brain injuries.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nAmerican football is a rough and dangerous game. It features high-speed collisions between human beings, at least one of whom is often very large. Broken bones, torn ligaments, and even occasional paralysis can result. But it is the research on brain injuries that has caused many people to claim football is immoral and to advocate that it be banned. Such calls have gained the attention and opposition of the National Football League (NFL) given the high popularity and profitability of football as a spectator sport.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as “a disruption in the normal function of the brain that can be caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head, or penetrating head injury.” A concussion is a form of TBI where the blow causes the brain to move rapidly back and forth, bouncing around in the skull and suffering various types of structural damage. Although concussions can carry serious consequences, they are termed a “mild” form of TBI because they are not typically life-threatening. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), says the Mayo Clinic, is “brain degeneration likely caused by repeated head traumas.” Repetitive head impacts (RHIs) can cumulatively lead to CTE and early death, even though no single RHI results in a concussion.\n\nIf only one thing is clear about the current science surrounding sports-related concussions (SRCs) and their related brain injuries, it’s that very little is certain about the current science. The field is surprisingly new. A significant scientific breakthrough occurred in 2002 when an African-American neuropathologist in Pittsburgh named Bennet Omalu (played by Will Smith in the 2015 movie Concussion) performed an autopsy on Hall of Fame center Mike Webster. Dr. Omalu identified abnormal clumps of the protein tau in Webster’s brain, which he believed to be evidence of CTE. Such proteins develop in tangles that slowly strangle neurons and, consequently, inhibit brain function.\n\nMany studies point to how dangerous football is to players’ long-term brain health. Although there is also research related to college players and younger, this case study focuses on the NFL. The studies show:\n\n- Over two regular seasons (2012-2014), NFL players sustained 4,384 injuries, including 301 concussions. This statistic is up 61% from 2002-2007, perhaps reflecting an improvement of awareness and reporting (Lawrence et al. 2015).\n\n- In a study of 14,000 NFL players, researchers found that even head impacts insufficient to cause concussions can mount up over the years, leading to CTE and premature death. An NFL player who plays 24 games increases the likelihood of premature death by 16% (Ehrlich et al., 2019).\n\n- A 2019 study of the brains of 223 football players with CTE and 43 players without CTE found that for each additional 2.6 years of play, the risk of developing CTE doubled (Mex et al. 2019).\n\nGiven the results of these studies, there has been a strong outcry against football, including at the NFL level. The NFL initially pushed back against the implications of such research. Then, as evidence piled up, the NFL funded research itself about head injuries and also how to design safer equipment. And, the NFL made rule changes in an attempt to make the game safer. The NFL has also changed rules to discourage helmet-to-helmet contact, and instituted protocols for safely returning concussed players to the field.\n\nDespite these changes, controversy continues because the science in this area is not settled. Importantly, standard medical imaging techniques do not show brain damage even when a player has had a concussion. And CTE cannot truly be diagnosed until the brain is examined after death.\n\nNeuropsychologist Munro Cullum argues: “I worry the pendulum has swung too far. The reality is that we still don’t know who is most likely to suffer a concussion, who will take longer to recover, how anatomic or genetic differences influence concussions, and who may be at risk of prolonged symptoms or developing cognitive problems later in life.”\n\nSome studies seem to indicate that concussions may be more benign than feared.

Providing more specific action steps, timelines, and key stakeholders involved in each aspect of the plan would enhance its effectiveness and feasibility.\n\nOverall, this plan offers a solid foundation for addressing the fallout from Lochte's actions and guiding him towards making amends and demonstrating personal growth. By refining the plan with more detailed execution strategies, it can become a more robust and impactful framework for Lochte's redemption process."}]}

When Winfrey invited Frey back on her show, she harangued him for lying, saying that she felt “duped” and that Frey had “betrayed millions of readers.” Talese described Winfrey’s rebuke of Frey as “mean and self-serving,” while critics of Frey saw him as opportunistic.\n\nFrey defended the right of authors and memoirists to draw upon their memories, not only upon documented facts: “I wanted the stories in the book to ebb and flow, to have dramatic arcs, to have the tension that all great stories require.” Authors and literary critics have echoed this sentiment, noting that memoirs are not necessarily the same genre as biographies or autobiographies. When asked about this controversy, author Joyce Carol Oates stated, “the tradition of personal memoir has always been highly ‘fictionalized’ — colored with an individual&#8217;s own ‘emotional truth’ … This is an ethical issue…with convincing arguments on both sides. In the end, [Winfrey] had to defend her own ethical standards of truth on her television program, which was courageous of her; and [Talese] had to defend her standards as a longtime revered editor, which was courageous of her.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If I were in this situation, I would recommend that Doubleday issue a public statement acknowledging the inaccuracies and fabrications in James Frey's book, A Million Little Pieces.

The lack of regulation and oversight has led to exploitative labor practices and environmental degradation.\n\nFor paleontologists and collectors, acquiring these amber fossils presents a moral quandary. While the specimens offer unparalleled scientific value, purchasing them may inadvertently support conflict and exploitation. Some scientists argue that studying these fossils is essential for advancing knowledge, while others advocate for a boycott to avoid contributing to the ongoing strife.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by the international demand for amber fossils, which drives up prices and incentivizes continued mining under unethical conditions. Efforts to establish ethical sourcing guidelines and promote responsible practices have been proposed, but enforcement remains challenging in a region with limited governance and oversight.\n\nIn summary, the discovery of Myanmar's amber fossils has opened new windows into the ancient past but has also highlighted the complex interplay between scientific pursuit and ethical responsibility. Balancing the desire for knowledge with the imperative to avoid harm remains a contentious issue within the scientific community.

This could involve working with reputable suppliers who adhere to strict ethical standards and engage in fair trade practices.\n\nAdditionally, I would advocate for greater awareness within the scientific community about the ethical dilemmas surrounding the acquisition of Myanmar's amber fossils.

Pao began working at Kleiner Perkins in 2005. She became a junior investing partner, but after several years at the firm was passed over for a senior partner position and was eventually terminated. Pao claimed that men with similar profiles and achievements were promoted instead.\n\nIn late 2011, Pao and a coworker were asked by a senior partner to come up with ways of improving the firm’s treatment of women, but the senior partner, according to Pao, was “noncommittal.” On January 4, 2012, Pao took this issue a step further and wrote a formal memorandum to several of her superiors and the firm’s outside counsel. In the memorandum, she described harassment she had received while at the firm, claiming she had been excluded from meetings by male partners, and asserting an absence of training and policies to prevent discrimination at the firm. Pao’s memo indicated that she wished to work with the firm on improving conditions for women. She was fired on October 1, 2012. The lawsuit went to trial in February 2015.\n\nIn a testimony during the trial, Pao explained that she sued because there was no process for HR issues at the firm and believed she had exhausted all options for addressing these issues internally:\n\n> “It’s been a long journey, and I’ve tried many times to bring Kleiner Perkins to the right path. I think there should be equal opportunities for women and men to be venture capitalists. I wanted to be a VC but I wasn’t able to do so in that environment. And I think it’s important…to make those opportunities available in the future. And I wanted to make sure my story was told.”\n\nPao’s lawsuit made four claims against Kleiner Perkins:\n\n1. They discriminated against Pao on the basis of gender by failing to promote her and/or terminating her employment.\n\n2. They retaliated by failing to promote her because of conversations she had in late 2011 and/or the memo from January 4, 2012.\n\n3. They failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent gender discrimination against her.\n\n4. They retaliated against her by terminating her employment because of conversations she had in late 2011 and/or the memo from January 4, 2012.\n\nPao’s legal team argued that men were promoted ahead of women, women who experienced sexual harassment received little support, and women’s ideas were often more quickly dismissed than men’s. Pao’s performance reviews revealed contradictory criticisms such as “too bold” and “too quiet.” Pao also accused company partner Ajit Nazre of pressuring her into an affair and subsequently retaliating against her after she ended the relationship. She said she received an inappropriate gift containing erotic imagery and was present while men at the firm were making inappropriate conversation. Further, the legal team described how Pao and other women had been left out of certain meetings and gatherings.\n\nThe defense’s case focused on Pao’s performance and character, noting that Pao received several negative performance reviews and acted entitled or resentful toward other employees and was not a team player. Evidence included evaluations, self-evaluations, meeting summaries, and messages both personal and professional. Kleiner Perkins claimed that Pao was paid more than her male counterparts, including bonuses and training. The firm also argued that Pao’s job description was mostly managerial and that limiting her involvement in investing was therefore not a form of discrimination.\n\nThe verdict was announced on March 27, 2015. The jury ruled 10 to 2 in favor of Kleiner Perkins on the first three claims, and 8 to 4 in favor of Kleiner Perkins on the fourth claim. Speaking after the trial, juror Steve Sammut said that the verdict came down to performance reviews, in which Pao’s negative criticism remained consistent each year. But he added that he wished there was some way for Kleiner Perkins to be punished for its treatment of employees, “It isn’t good. It’s like the wild, wild West.” Juror Marshalette Ramsey voted in favor of Pao, believing Pao had been discriminated against. Ramsey stated that the male junior partners who were promoted “had those same character flaws that Ellen was cited with.”\n\nDeborah Rhode, law professor at Stanford University, said that even with this loss, Pao’s lawsuit succeeded in prompting debate about women in venture capital and tech. She stated, “This case sends a powerful signal to Silicon Valley in general and the venture capital industry in particular… Defendants who win in court sometimes lose in the world outside it.” After the verdict was announced, Pao stated that she hoped the case at least helped level the playing field for women and minorities in venture capital. She later wrote:\n\n> “I have a request for all companies: Please don’t try to silence employees who raise discrimination and harassment concerns. …I hope future cases prove me wrong and show that our community and our jurists have now developed a better understanding of how discrimination works in real life, in the tech world, in the press and in the courts.”\n\nPao’s case has since been credited for inspiring others facing workplace discrimination to act; similar lawsuits have been filed against companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nOn May 10, 2012, executive Ellen Pao filed a lawsuit against her employer, Silicon Valley-based tech venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (Kleiner Perkins), on grounds of gender discrimination. Pao began working at Kleiner Perkins in 2005. She became a junior investing partner, but after several years at the firm was passed over for a senior partner position and was eventually terminated. Pao claimed that men with similar profiles and achievements were promoted instead.\n\nIn late 2011, Pao and a coworker were asked by a senior partner to come up with ways of improving the firm’s treatment of women, but the senior partner, according to Pao, was “noncommittal.” On January 4, 2012, Pao took this issue a step further and wrote a formal memorandum to several of her superiors and the firm’s outside counsel. In the memorandum, she described harassment she had received while at the firm, claiming she had been excluded from meetings by male partners, and asserting an absence of training and policies to prevent discrimination at the firm. Pao’s memo indicated that she wished to work with the firm on improving conditions for women. She was fired on October 1, 2012. The lawsuit went to trial in February 2015.\n\nIn a testimony during the trial, Pao explained that she sued because there was no process for HR issues at the firm and believed she had exhausted all options for addressing these issues internally:\n\n> “It’s been a long journey, and I’ve tried many times to bring Kleiner Perkins to the right path. I think there should be equal opportunities for women and men to be venture capitalists. I wanted to be a VC but I wasn’t able to do so in that environment. And I think it’s important…to make those opportunities available in the future. And I wanted to make sure my story was told.”\n\nPao’s lawsuit made four claims against Kleiner Perkins:\n\n1. They discriminated against Pao on the basis of gender by failing to promote her and/or terminating her employment.\n\n2. They retaliated by failing to promote her because of conversations she had in late 2011 and/or the memo from January 4, 2012.\n\n3. They failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent gender discrimination against her.\n\n4. They retaliated against her by terminating her employment because of conversations she had in late 2011 and/or the memo from January 4, 2012.\n\nPao’s legal team argued that men were promoted ahead of women, women who experienced sexual harassment received little support, and women’s ideas were often more quickly dismissed than men’s. Pao’s performance reviews revealed contradictory criticisms such as “too bold” and “too quiet.” Pao also accused company partner Ajit Nazre of pressuring her into an affair and subsequently retaliating against her after she ended the relationship. She said she received an inappropriate gift containing erotic imagery and was present while men at the firm were making inappropriate conversation. Further, the legal team described how Pao and other women had been left out of certain meetings and gatherings.\n\nThe defense’s case focused on Pao’s performance and character, noting that Pao received several negative performance reviews and acted entitled or resentful toward other employees and was not a team player. Evidence included evaluations, self-evaluations, meeting summaries, and messages both personal and professional. Kleiner Perkins claimed that Pao was paid more than her male counterparts, including bonuses and training. The firm also argued that Pao’s job description was mostly managerial and that limiting her involvement in investing was therefore not a form of discrimination.\n\nThe verdict was announced on March 27, 2015. The jury ruled 10 to 2 in favor of Kleiner Perkins on the first three claims, and 8 to 4 in favor of Kleiner Perkins on the fourth claim. Speaking after the trial, juror Steve Sammut said that the verdict came down to performance reviews, in which Pao’s negative criticism remained consistent each year. But he added that he wished there was some way for Kleiner Perkins to be punished for its treatment of employees, “It isn’t good. It’s like the wild, wild West.” Juror Marshalette Ramsey voted in favor of Pao, believing Pao had been discriminated against. Ramsey stated that the male junior partners who were promoted “had those same character flaws that Ellen was cited with.”\n\nDeborah Rhode, law professor at Stanford University, said that even with this loss, Pao’s lawsuit succeeded in prompting debate about women in venture capital and tech. She stated, “This case sends a powerful signal to Silicon Valley in general and the venture capital industry in particular… Defendants who win in court sometimes lose in the world outside it.” After the verdict was announced, Pao stated that she hoped the case at least helped level the playing field for women and minorities in venture capital. She later wrote:\n\n> “I have a request for all companies: Please don’t try to silence employees who raise discrimination and harassment concerns. …I hope future cases prove me wrong and show that our community and our jurists have now developed a better understanding of how discrimination works in real life, in the tech world, in the press and in the courts.”\n\nPao’s case has since been credited for inspiring others facing workplace discrimination to act; similar lawsuits have been filed against companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nIn the context of health care in the United States, the value on autonomy and liberty was cogently expressed by Justice Benjamin Cardozo in *Schloendorff v. Society of New York Hospitals* (1914), when he wrote, “Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body.” This case established the principle of informed consent and has become central to modern medical practice ethics. However, a number of events since 1914 have illustrated how the autonomy of patients may be overridden. In *Buck v. Bell* (1927), Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that the involuntary sterilization of “mental defectives,” then a widespread practice in the U.S., was justified, stating, “Three generations of imbeciles are enough.” Another example, the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, in which African-American males were denied life-saving treatment for syphilis as part of a scientific study of the natural course of the disease, began in 1932 and was not stopped until 1972.\n\nProviding advice related to topics of bioethics, the President’s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research stated:\n\n> “Informed consent is rooted in the fundamental recognition—reflected in the legal presumption of competency—that adults are entitled to accept or reject health care interventions on the basis of their own personal values and in furtherance of their own personal goals.”\n\nBut what of circumstances where patients are deemed incompetent through judicial proceedings, and where someone else is designated to make decisions on behalf of a mentally incompetent individual?\n\nConsider the following case:\n\nA middle-aged man was involuntarily committed to a state psychiatric hospital because he was considered dangerous to others due to severe paranoid thinking. His violent behavior was controlled only by injectable medications, which were initially administered against his will. He had been declared mentally incompetent, and the decisions to approve the use of psychotropic medications were made by his adult son who had been awarded guardianship and who held medical power of attorney.\n\nWhile the medications suppressed the patient’s violent agitation, they made little impact on his paranoid symptoms. His chances of being able to return to his home community appeared remote.

The Dobbs decision places abortion rule-making in the hands of the U.S. Congress, which seems unlikely to reach a consensus any time soon, and the state legislatures, which are widely split on abortion issues. For example, in the first half of 2022, 11 states passed laws to protect or expand abortion care and 12 states enacted restrictions. In the first citizen vote after Dobbs, Kansans voted to retain a right to abortion.\n\nAs legislatures around the country continue to debate the scope of permissible abortions, it is clear that much attention will be paid to the issue of prenatal medical testing. At least two-thirds of diagnoses of Down syndrome lead to a decision to abort where that is permitted. Many states permit abortions where prenatal testing has revealed genetic testing abnormalities in fetuses, but several states have specifically prohibited abortions performed for the purpose of avoiding giving birth to a baby with Down syndrome.\n\nIn early 2023, more than 40 pro-life organizations wrote every Republican member of Congress to urge enactment of pro-life laws that would, among other things, prohibit abortions based solely on a diagnosis of Down Syndrome (the “Protecting Individuals with Down Syndrome Act”).\n\nThose who oppose prenatal testing bans on abortion argue that laws based on intention or motivation to terminate a pregnancy would be unenforceable. “This is interference with a medical decision following a complicated diagnosis,” according to Kellie Copeland, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, “Not knowing the family and the circumstances, the legislature can’t possibly take into account all the factors involved.”\n\nSupporters of the “Protecting Individuals with Down Syndrome Act” have described this as a way to limit the number of abortions and protect babies born with disabilities. Mike Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life, stated, “We all want to be born perfect, but none of us are, and everyone has a right to live, perfect or not.”\n\nIn November 2022, the Court of Appeal in Britain ruled that the country’s Abortion Act that allows abortion up until birth for a fetus with Down Syndrome was legal and did not interfere with the rights of the living disabled. The plaintiff in the case, Heidi Crowter, who has the condition, complained that the decision “doesn’t respect my life.”\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would review the details of the \"Protecting Individuals with Down Syndrome Act\" proposed by pro-life organizations to understand its specific provisions and implications.

This research would involve examining the perspectives of organizations such as NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio and Ohio Right to Life, as well as seeking out expert opinions and analyses from bioethicists, medical professionals, and legal scholars.\n\nFurthermore, I would assess the potential impacts of enacting the \"Protecting Individuals with Down Syndrome Act\" on individuals and families facing prenatal diagnoses of Down Syndrome. This assessment would involve considering the broader implications for reproductive rights, disability rights, healthcare access, and societal attitudes towards individuals with disabilities.\n\nBased on this research and analysis, I would prepare a summary report outlining the key findings, arguments, and potential consequences of the proposed legislation.

The number of minors apprehended as they tried to enter the U.S. nearly doubled over the previous year from 35,200 to 66,120. The fastest growing segment of child migrants were those under 12 years old, increasing concern that vulnerable children were risking their lives on a dangerous journey to the U.S. to escape violence and poverty in their home countries. The influx posed a number of logistical and ethical dilemmas for state and federal authorities, and overwhelmed the capacity of authorities to process new migrants or even provide shelter for them.\n\nThe Obama administration responded with a multifaceted plan that included millions of dollars of emergency funding. The plan called for increased border enforcement, deportation of those deemed economic migrants, more detention facilities, additional immigration judges to process claims for political asylum as refugees, and new programs in countries of origin that would mitigate violence and economic hardship for minors as well as discourage or intercept migrants before reaching the U.S. Because facilities at the border were being overrun, the government also transported some migrants to other parts of the country. This drew protests from local communities that tried to turn back buses filled with migrant children. The administration’s response drew criticism from all quarters.\n\nHuman rights and refugee advocates, as well as many religious institutions, argued that the U.S. was neglecting its moral obligation to protect innocent and vulnerable children, many of whom were fleeing violence at the hands of criminal gangs and the drug trade. According to journalist Sonia Nazario, the influx of minors was not a crisis of illegal immigration but rather a refugee crisis: the violence in countries, such as Honduras, was prompting youths to flee their homes as a means of survival. Nazario argued that these refugees, similar to refugees in war-torn regions such as Syria, deserved legal and physical protection. She criticized the Obama administration for concentrating on border enforcement and interdiction of child migrants instead.\n\nOthers argued the opposite point: that the crisis was brought on by weak control of U.S. borders. According to Jessica Vaughn, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, the ongoing crisis was “the best evidence yet that lax enforcement, both at the border and within the country, and talk of amnesty only bring more illegal immigration.” She and others promoting stronger limits on immigration urged the Obama administration to turn back those who entered the country illegally on the grounds that the only way to end this crisis was to stem the tide of migrants before they got to the United States.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would advocate for a balanced approach that prioritizes the safety and well-being of the unaccompanied minors while also addressing the root causes of the crisis.

The mill had  originally  been\nlocated on this site in order to use  water  power  as  the  primary  energy\nsource for running the  mill  equipment  through  a  vast  array  of  belts,\npulleys  and  reduction  gears.   However,  because  of  the  site  location\nadjacent to the river, the  soils  tended  to  be  loose  and/or  moderately\ncompressible,  requiring  deep  foundations  for  heavier  portions  of  the\nstructures.\n\nOne of the most prominent mill structures was the original tower  which  was\nin excess of 15 stories in height, and over the years the  large  clocks  on\nall four sides of the tower became the standard reference for  correct  time\nin the local community, even after the mill became defunct and lay idle  for\nmore than 35 years.  Recently however, the region has realized an  increased\ngrowth due to a demand for computer  software  development  for  industrial,\nmedical and personal uses.  MegaBite Unlimited, a nationally known  computer\nsoftware development firm, surveyed a number  of  sites  in  the  state  and\ndecided that because of the semi-rural atmosphere of the  town,  the  above-\naverage educational background of most of the residents and  the  attractive\ntax incentives offered by the local improvement  board,  they  would  design\nand build a new corporate facility in the town.\n\nThe prime site for the new facility was the abandoned mill and clock  tower.\n Since the mill buildings had been left without maintenance for such a  long\nperiod, it was decided to demolish them and build  an  efficiently  designed\ncomplex of structures which would  complement  the  colonial  decor  of  the\narea.  The local planning  commission  concurred  with  this  decision,  but\ninsisted that the original 15-plus  story  clock  tower  be  retained  as  a\nsymbol of the prosperity the town once enjoyed,  and  would  now  experience\nagain.\n\nDuring the design  of  the  new  facility,  MegaBite  Unlimited’s  architect\nretained I. B. Stout, a structural engineer from a nearby city,  to  do  the\nstructural engineering and design such systems as might be necessary  during\ndemolition of the old structures in order to protect the  old  clock  tower,\nif necessary.  Stout’s review of  the  available  records  showed  that  the\nheavy clock tower was supported on a 48-foot square mat at a depth of  about\n18 feet below ground surface, and the mat in turn was  supported  on  wooden\npiles driven to some depth below the  water  table  to  pick  up  additional\nsupport in the underlying soils.  Based on this information, Stout  designed\na shallow retaining system for support of the sides of the excavation  which\nwould occur during demolition of the adjacent mill  buildings  approximately\n50 feet away.\n\nThe plans and specifications for the demolition were completed,  along  with\nthe  design  documents  for  the  proposed  new  facility,   advertised   to\ncontractors for bid, and the job was let to Colonial  Construction  Company,\na general construction contractor in business for more than 60 years in  the\nlocal  area.   Since  Colonial  had  the  necessary  heavy  equipment,  they\nproceeded with the demolition work  as  one  of  the  first  stages  of  the\nproject.  About  the  time  that  the  demolition  excavation  had  come  to\napproximately 100 feet from the old clock tower,  one  of  the  construction\ncrew noted that the tower seemed a bit out of plumb, but thought  little  of\nit, since the tower was so  old.   However,  as  the  excavation  progressed\ncloser to the tower, it became apparent that the tower  was  tilting  at  an\nincreasing rate, and toward the demolition excavation.\nColonial stopped work over a weekend to consider what steps, if any,  should\nbe taken with regard to the clock tower.  Upon  returning  to  the  site  on\nMonday morning, new survey measurements indicated that the tilt at  the  top\nof the tower had increased to six inches.  At that point Colonial called  W.\nE. Holdem, Inc., a specialty ground modification  subcontractor,  and  asked\nfor their assistance in correcting the  situation  so  that  the  demolition\ncould  be  completed  to  the  extent  originally  planned.   Realizing  the\nseriousness of the problem, Holdem in turn called  in  Jonathan  Turnbuckle,\nan engineering consultant in the Midwest who  had  an  excellent  reputation\nfor coming up with  innovative,  cost-effective  solutions  to  construction\nproblems requiring ground modification.  Holdem knew of  Turnbuckle  because\nthey had worked together on a number  of  projects  over  the  past  several\nyears in other areas of the country.\n\nTurnbuckle was quick to respond; visited the  site;  assessed  the  problem;\ndevised a solution with a reasonable chance of success; conferred  with  the\narchitect, I. B. Stout, the architect’s  geotechnical  engineer,  MegaBite’s\nrepresentatives and  the  town’s  building  officials  and  the  mayor,  and\nexplained the solution.  He also made  recommendations  for  standby  cranes\nand other safety precautions should it not  be  possible  to  implement  the\nproposed ground modification scheme in time to  save  the  clock  tower  and\navert potential property damage and possible personal injury.\n\nThe  entire  group  cooperated  in  expediting  the  standby  equipment  and\nprocedures. Holdem mobilized on the site within two days and  initiated  the\nremediation procedure devised by  Turnbuckle,  successfully  continuing  the\nprocess and averting the collapse of the clock tower.  It took a  period  of\nabout 70 days to continue the process  until  the  adjacent  demolition  was\ncompleted and the excavation backfilled, with  constant  monitoring  on  the\nsite and analyses being required for at least the first 45  days.   No  one,\nincluding I. B. Stout whose original  design  had  allowed  the  problem  to\noccur, was sued.\n\nAbout three weeks or so after the remediation  procedure  was  initiated  by\nHoldem, Inc., Jonathan Turnbuckle realized that since the  solution  he  had\ndevised was an engineering design, he should have permission to practice  in\nthe state, if only for a temporary period.  He then  contacted  the  state’s\nBoard of Registration for Engineers and Surveyors,  requesting  a  temporary\nengineering license.  He was told by the Board that although many states  do\nhave a provision for such a temporary or  short-term  permit  for  engineers\nlicensed in other states, this particular state had no  such  provision  and\nhe would have to make a full,  formal  application  for  registration  as  a\nprofessional engineer in the state.\n\nTurnbuckle  obtained  the  necessary  forms,  filled  them  out   (including\nreferences to the professional  engineering  registrations  he  held  in  17\nother states), and turned them in to the Board  within  a  couple  of  days.\nApproximately  three  months  after  the  remedial  construction  had   been\ncompleted and the clock tower saved, he received notice  of  his  acceptance\nby the Board as a registered professional engineer  by  reciprocity.   Since\nthe project was complete as far as Turnbuckle  and  Holdem  were  concerned,\nthey each went on to other projects in other areas.\n\nRecently, Turnbuckle has received a registered letter from the  state  Board\nof Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors notifying  him\nthat I. B. Stout, the structural engineer  for  the  MegaBite  project,  has\nfiled a formal complaint against him for practicing as  an  engineer  during\nthe time of the clock  tower  incident  without  a  license  in  the  state.\nFurthermore, Turnbuckle is advised that  Stout  is  prepared  to  carry  the\nmatter to court, where Stout intends to sue  Turnbuckle  for  a  substantial\nsum of money, claiming that too many out-of-state engineers do  designs  for\nprojects within the state without  being  licensed,  and  that  practice  is\nfinancially detrimental to Stout and the survival of his practice.\n\nIs Turnbuckle at fault for not having a professional engineer’s  license  in\nthe  state  during  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  clock   tower\nremediation?

The legal counsel can provide guidance on how to respond to the complaint, including any necessary steps to defend himself against the allegations.\n\nAdditionally, Turnbuckle should be prepared to cooperate fully with the state Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors in their investigation of the matter.

Placidville  is  a  small  city  with  a  population  of\n83,576, based on a 1996 census.  It also is  the  location  of  the  state's\nlargest university  (about  23,000  students).   Due  to  the  business  and\nrecreational opportunities in the state, the population  has  been  steadily\nincreasing over the past 15 years, and an aggressive  building  program  was\ninitiated  at  the  university  five  years  ago  to  construct  and   equip\napproximately 16 new classroom and laboratory buildings over  the  following\n20 years.\n\nLast weekend your wife invited mutual friends,  Ted  and  Alice  Hammer,  to\nspend the weekend with you at your cottage on a lake in  the  northern  part\nof the state.  Ted is a senior project  manager  with  Quality  Construction\nCo., a local commercial and institutional building construction  firm.   His\nwife, Alice, is an activist in  the  Placidville  community,  and  generally\nknown for her on-going campaign for integrity in government.\n\nDuring the weekend, Alice mentioned that at a recent zoning  board  meeting,\nGus Olson, one of the other board members, told her  that  the  construction\ncompany he works for as a carpenter (Shreud Contractors)  has  assigned  him\nas the construction foreman for a garage being built for  Ray  Vandergrafft.\nAlice recognized the name and knew  that  Ray  is  one  of  several  project\nmanagers for the Capital Construction Projects  Office  at  the  university.\nGus laughed and said that something as small as a wood-framed garage was  an\nunusual project for Shreud Construction, since they normally  were  involved\nin heavy steel erection projects for large structures in the region.\n\nTed interjected that he had heard Shreud Contractors recently was awarded  a\ncontract with an estimated budget of $500,000 to make  remedial  repairs  to\nthe steel superstructure of the university's  aging  football  stadium.   He\nunderstood the contract had been awarded directly to Shreud on  a  time-and-\nmaterials basis  to  avoid  the  expense  to  the  university  of  preparing\nextensive bid documents and going through a competitive  selection  process.\nHe said it was interesting that the  garage  construction  for  Vandergrafft\nwas going on at the same time as the remedial work on the stadium.\n\nIn fact, Ted said, he had learned a few years ago  that  his  own  firm  had\npreviously  been  involved  in  a  similar  situation  when  they  were  the\ncontractor for a new engineering test facility at the university and at  the\nsame time had built a large addition to Ray Vandergrafft's  kitchen  because\nhis wife, Olga, was a gourmet chef.  Ted said he had decided not to make  an\nissue of it, since the project had been completed for some time, and he  had\nbeen told that the construction materials and  appliances  for  the  kitchen\nhad come from surplus materials from the new lab site  and  incentive  gifts\nfrom the laboratory equipment suppliers.   He  also  had  learned  that  the\nconstruction crew worked on the kitchen when there was not enough to  do  at\nthe new engineering test facility site.\n\nAt that point your wife said she had driven by Fred  Facade's  house  a  few\ndays ago, saw a Shreud pickup truck parked in the driveway  and  noted  that\nthere was remodeling going on at the house, apparently  to  raise  the  roof\nand add more space on the second floor.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nYou are a senior engineer and project manager  for  Enviroconcern,  Inc.,  a\ngeo-environmental  group  specializing  in   groundwater   and   underground\npollution  mitigation  in  a  large,  heavily  industrialized  area  on  the\nAtlantic seaboard.  Your firm has established  a  reputation  for  excellent\nand accurate work among  clients  and  regulatory  agencies,  including  the\nfederal EPA and state health and ecology departments, as well.\n\nSeveral months ago, your firm was contacted by Ira Klene, the  president  of\nIndustrial  Solvents,  Ltd.   His  company  was  named,  among  others,   as\nsuspected of having moderate to severe groundwater pollution  concentrations\nbeneath his  industrial  solvent  manufacturing  plant  and  adjacent  plant\nproperty by the state regulatory agency.  In order  to  avoid  severe  fines\nand potential lengthy litigation, Mr. Klene negotiated a contract with  your\nfirm to investigate the alleged  problem,  determine  the  severity  of  the\ncondition, and prepare a report of the site  investigation  and  conclusions\nfor transmittal to the state regulatory agency,  in  compliance  with  their\nstated requirements.\n\nAs a result, you were assigned to be the  project  manager  and  coordinated\nthe installation of an array of groundwater monitoring wells, well  sampling\nand testing, analyses and preparation of the written  report.   During  your\nvisits to the site, you noted that abutting  the  Industrial  Solvent  plant\nproperty on three sides and directly across the street  were  several  other\nfirms  either  manufacturing  or  using  the  types  of  chemicals  used  by\nIndustrial Solvents.\n\nBased on the results of the  field  monitoring  and  sampling,  Ira  Klene's\ninitial claim that his company was only a minor contributor to the  problem,\nif at all, appeared to be substantiated.  Groundwater  elevation  monitoring\nin the observation wells indicated that the direction  of  groundwater  flow\nwas from west (upgradient) to east (downgradient) underneath the  Industrial\nSolvents  site.   Testing  of  samples  taken  from  the  monitoring   wells\nindicated that the concentration of toxics in the  groundwater  were  higher\nat the west side of the site, and decreased in  the  wells  further  to  the\neast on the site.\n\nYou finished putting your report together yesterday  in  preparation  for  a\npresentation  to  the  state  regulatory  agency  the  day  after  tomorrow,\naccompanied by Mr. Klene and his  in-house  corporate  legal  counsel.   The\nconclusion stated in your report is that the test results showed the  levels\nof toxics in the groundwater decrease across the site  from  west  to  east,\ntherefore the major  portion  of  the  pollution  is  originating  with  the\nindustrial chemical plants further to  the  west.   If  Industrial  Solvents\nLtd. is contributing to the pollution under their site, it  can  only  be  a\nminor to insignificant amount.\n\nEarly this morning you decided to visit the  Industrial  Solvents  site  one\nmore time,  just  to  be  certain  that  you  had  not  missed  anything  of\nimportance in your general description of the site  and  the  activities  in\nthe plant.  Since the site is not far out of your way from your home to  the\nEnviroconcern offices, and you are by nature an early riser, you arrived  at\nthe Industrial Solvents site about 6:45 a.m., about 45  minutes  before  the\nplant goes into operation on a weekday basis.  After looking  around  inside\nthe plant, you wandered around to the parking lot to  the  west  behind  the\nbuilding to glance at the monitoring well installations in that area.   When\nyou got there, you recognized Ira Klene with a rubberized raincoat over  his\nsuit, wearing boots and standing at one of the monitoring well caps  in  the\nmiddle of the parking lot with his back to you.\n\nSince he had not seen you,  you  stepped  behind  a  pickup  truck  lot  and\ncontinued to observe Mr. Klene's actions.  It soon became  obvious  that  he\nhad a key to the monitoring well caps in one hand and a  hose  connected  to\nthe water spigot on the back of the building in the other.  In the  next  25\nminutes he proceeded from well to well toward the  building,  unlocking  the\nwell caps, inserting the hose and allowing water to flow into each well  for\nseveral minutes.  At first you could  not  believe  what  you  were  seeing.\nPoring water into  these  downgradient  wells  causes  a  reduction  in  the\nmeasured level of toxics in the groundwater  at  those  locations,  creating\nthe appearance of decreasing toxic concentrations across the site from  west\nto east.\n\nNot knowing what to do or  say,  and  not  wanting  to  confront  Mr.  Klene\ndirectly at that moment, you crept back around the truck, waited  until  his\nback was turned, and rapidly went back into the building and out  the  front\nto where you had parked your car, and drove as quickly as possible  to  your\noffice.\n\nAs you sit at your desk you realize that all of the analytical data in  your\nfinal report is now suspect  and  unreliable.   Your  firm's  contract  with\nIndustrial Solvents Ltd. contains a confidentiality clause requiring you  to\ndiscuss  the  findings  in  your  report  with  them  before  releasing  the\ninformation to anyone else.  The presentation for the state agency has  been\nconfirmed for the day after tomorrow.\n\nYou alternately stare at the wall  and  at  your  finished  report  for  the\nIndustrial Solvents site on your  desk  in  front  of  you.   You  then  ask\nyourself the big question of the day: what do I do now?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would immediately contact my supervisor and the legal department within my firm to inform them of the situation. I would provide a detailed account of what I witnessed at the Industrial Solvents site, including Mr. Klene's actions of tampering with the monitoring wells. I would emphasize the potential implications of this tampering on the accuracy and reliability of our final report.\n\nI would request guidance on how to proceed, particularly considering the confidentiality clause in our contract with Industrial Solvents Ltd. It would be crucial to discuss the ethical and legal implications of this discovery and seek advice on how to handle the upcoming presentation to the state regulatory agency.\n\nAdditionally, I would document all the information and observations I gathered during my visit to the site, ensuring that there is a clear record of events for future reference. This documentation would serve as evidence to support any necessary actions taken by our firm in response to the situation."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is the answer ethical?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The suggested course of action is commendable in its immediate response to the ethical dilemma presented. By promptly contacting the supervisor and legal department within the firm, the senior engineer demonstrates a commitment to transparency and integrity. Providing a detailed account of the observed tampering with monitoring wells is essential for ensuring all relevant parties are informed of the situation accurately. Seeking guidance on how to proceed and addressing the confidentiality clause in the contract with Industrial Solvents Ltd. are prudent steps to navigate the complex ethical and legal implications of the discovery. Documenting all information and observations for future reference adds a layer of accountability and establishes a clear record of events.\n\nHowever, there are areas for improvement in the response. While informing internal stakeholders is crucial, it would also be advisable to consider involving external parties, such as regulatory agencies, to address the tampering and potential impact on the accuracy of the final report. Collaborating with regulatory bodies could help uphold transparency and integrity in the investigation process. Additionally, exploring ways to mitigate the repercussions of the tampering, such as conducting an independent review of the data or implementing additional monitoring measures, could strengthen the response to the ethical breach.\n\nOverall, the proposed action plan is a solid foundation for addressing the ethical dilemma at hand. By expanding the scope of involvement to include external stakeholders and considering proactive measures to rectify the situation, the senior engineer can further enhance the ethical integrity of the response."}]}

Her success is  the\nresult of a  lot  of  hard  work  for  more  than  ten  years,  as  well  as\nestablishing excellent relations with her clients.   One  of  the  specialty\nareas that has evolved in her practice has  been  the  renovation  of  major\nhistoric commercial buildings, many in the downtown  financial  district  of\nthe city.\n\nJulie has been asked to do a structural survey of the  Inverness  Block,  an\nold, well-recognized, seven-story granite-faced building  in  the  financial\ndistrict close to several other buildings which her  firm  has  investigated\nfor renovations in the past.  One of her largest clients, Charles A.  Smith,\nis in the final stages of negotiations to sell  the  Inverness  Block  to  a\ngroup of foreign investors represented by Sam Goldworthy, a local  attorney.\n This sale is very important  to  Smith  because  it  is  the  last  of  his\nproperties to be put on the market, and represents  the  liquid  capital  he\nneeds to retire to a 30-acre estate he has acquired on Grand Cayman  Island,\nwhere there is a most advantageous tax structure.\n\nIn order to wrap up some of the final  details  and  firm  up  the  purchase\nprice (which at present is quite generous), Sam Goldworthy has  requested  a\nstructural survey of specific  building  elements,  including  the  outdated\nwindow casements, among  others.   Mr.  Smith  agrees  to  have  the  survey\ncompleted, and negotiates a fair price with Julie  Adams  to  do  the  work.\nThey sign an  agreement  which  contains  Smith’s  usual  clause  that  “all\ninformation discovered by the engineer shall  become  the  property  of  the\nclient (Smith) and shall not be released  to  others  without  the  client’s\nexpress written consent.”\n\nSince Julie is personally tied up with overseeing several structural  design\nprojects and she understands that the results of  the  proposed  survey  are\ncrucial to completing the purchase negotiations for the building before  the\nestablished  deadline,  she  assigns  Brock  Williams,  one  of   her   most\nexperienced  structural  engineers,  to  proceed  with  the  survey  of  the\nInverness Block.  Brock proceeds immediately, covers all  of  the  workscope\nitems required, except for inspection of  the  window  casements,  which  he\nsaves until last.\n\nWhen he gets to the window casements, they appear to be in excellent  shape.\n  However,  since  there  is  so  much  money  involved  in   the   purchase\nnegotiations, he decides to dismantle three units at  random  for  a  better\ndetermination.  With permission from Mr. Smith, Brock  carefully  dismantles\none of the units and uses a flashlight to look into the wall cavity  to  see\nhow the windows are attached.  A steel strap for anchoring  the  windows  is\nclearly visible in the uncovered space.\n\nAs he is about to replace the dismantled window  unit,  Brock  notices  that\nthe three-inch exterior granite veneer is attached to the building  by  clip\nangles welded to the steel building frame, typical of an  early  example  of\nstone-cladding on steel-frame construction.  In the beam of the  flashlight,\nthe clip angle within reach appears to be rusted.  Curious as to the  extent\nof this apparent corrosion, Brock reaches into the space,  grasps  the  clip\nangle and, to his horror, finds that it breaks off in his hand  without  any\nsignificant pressure.  Looking closer at the fracture,  he  determines  that\nthe clip is rusted virtually through the entire cross section.\n\nImmediately the implication of his discovery dawns on Brock, since  if  this\ncondition is typical throughout the building,  the  cost  of  repairs  could\napproach the  value  of  the  building  itself.

One  of  the  specialty\nareas that has evolved in her practice has  been  the  renovation  of  major\nhistoric commercial buildings, many in the downtown  financial  district  of\nthe city.\n\nJulie has been asked to do a structural survey of the  Inverness  Block,  an\nold, well-recognized, seven-story granite-faced building  in  the  financial\ndistrict close to several other buildings which her  firm  has  investigated\nfor renovations in the past.  One of her largest clients, Charles A.

Mr.  Smith  agrees  to  have  the  survey\ncompleted, and negotiates a fair price with Julie  Adams  to  do  the  work.\nThey sign an  agreement  which  contains  Smith’s  usual  clause  that  “all\ninformation discovered by the engineer shall  become  the  property  of  the\nclient (Smith) and shall not be released  to  others  without  the  client’s\nexpress written consent.”\n\nSince Julie is personally tied up with overseeing several structural  design\nprojects and she understands that the results of  the  proposed  survey  are\ncrucial to completing the purchase negotiations for the building before  the\nestablished  deadline,  she  assigns  Brock  Williams,  one  of   her   most\nexperienced  structural  engineers,  to  proceed  with  the  survey  of  the\nInverness Block.

He  then  indicates  that  he  has  other\nimportant matters to attend to and quickly ends the  meeting.   On  the  way\nback to the office, Julie goes over  her  conversation  with  Smith  in  her\nmind, and is bothered by the  sudden  termination  of  the  meeting.   As  a\nresult, she calls Smith on the telephone as soon as she  gets  back  to  her\noffice, indicating that the condition of the  exterior  cladding  is  a  far\nmore important issue than any of the items covered in the written report.\n\nCharles Smith tells her that he appreciates her concern,  but  the  purchase\ndeal is too far along to do anything about it.  Since the buyers  and  their\nrepresentative have had access to the  building  for  several  months,  they\ncould  have  investigated  and  determined  the  condition  of  the  granite\ncladding themselves.  In fact, they may  already  know  about  it  and  have\naccounted for it in their financial offer of  purchase.   If  not,  it  will\nturn up on one of the required periodic building checks in  the  future,  if\nit is really a substantial problem.  In addition, he says that the  deal  is\nnow ready to close the following afternoon, and her  cooperation  in  seeing\nthings his way will result in additional  work  on  other  projects  in  the\nfuture.  Besides, if she will feel more comfortable,  he  will  give  her  a\nconfidential letter confirming that  she  had  fully  informed  him  of  the\ncladding situation.\n\nNot knowing what else to say, she murmurs her assent.\n\nThat night, Julie presents the situation to her husband  for  his  comments.\nAfter hearing the story, he indicates  that  these  things  happen  all  the\ntime, and it is the responsibility of the buyer to be satisfied with  regard\nto the condition of the building.  Besides, having Smith complete  the  deal\nsuccessfully has serious implications  about  the  future  of  her  business\nrelationship with him, and  therefore  serious  implications  regarding  the\nfuture success of her company.  After  all,  there  are  the  fifteen  other\npeople working for Julie, as well as their families, to  think  of.   Making\nan issue of the situation, or even worse going public,  would  only  destroy\nthat relationship with Smith, and could jeopardize her  business.   Besides,\nin the heat of the moment she accepted the information given her  by  Brock,\nbut since she did not observe the clip angles personally, can  she  be  sure\nthat Brock’s conclusions were accurate?\n\nWhat should Julie do, if anything?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would advise Julie to carefully review the situation and weigh the potential consequences of her actions. She should consider seeking a second opinion from another structural engineer to verify Brock's findings about the rusted clip angles on the exterior granite veneer of the building. If the second opinion confirms the severity of the issue, Julie should consider disclosing this critical information to the prospective buyers through proper channels, such as communicating directly with Sam Goldworthy, the attorney representing the foreign investors.\n\nJulie should prioritize the safety implications of the rusted clip angles over the potential impact on her business relationship with Charles Smith. It is essential for her to act ethically and responsibly by ensuring that all parties involved are fully informed about the structural integrity issues of the building. Julie should not compromise on safety and structural integrity for the sake of maintaining business relationships."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is the answer ethical?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your response provides a clear and actionable plan for Julie to follow in this complex situation. You correctly emphasize the importance of prioritizing safety and ethical considerations over business relationships, which is commendable.

Additionally, you could have emphasized the importance of documenting all communication and actions taken to ensure transparency and accountability in the process.\n\nOverall, your advice is ethical and practical, but it could benefit from more specific guidance on how Julie should proceed with seeking a second opinion and disclosing the critical information to the prospective buyers."}]}

You have recently  completed  a  phase  one  (preliminary\nreview based on available information)  environmental  site  assessment  for\nAmericorp, one of the firm’s largest clients.  You  have  been  directed  to\nsend drafts of the report to the client’s law firm, Dewey, Stickum  &  Howe,\nfor review prior to issuing the final report.\n\nThe property in question is a large shopping mall located in an  area  which\nused to be heavily industrialized and is now being converted to  residential\nand commercial uses.  The site being investigated is not being sold;  rather\nit is being used as collateral  for  a  refinancing  loan  being  sought  by\nAmericorp from a local lending institution.\n\nIn the course of conducting the  research  and  preparing  the  report,  you\nhappen to have a conversation with an older  gentleman  at  a  nearby  lunch\ncounter who tells you that the property is known among  long-term  residents\nof the neighborhood to be contaminated because of  the  previous  operations\nof a creosoting plant on the site many years ago.  The shopping mall,  built\n38 years ago, was sited directly over  the  old  creosoting  plant  “because\nthat’s how they used to do it back then.”\n\nThis casual conversation is the only indication of  contamination  you  have\nbeen able to uncover through your research on the site.  As  a  result,  you\nprepare  and  submit  a  draft  of  the  report  to  the  Dewey  law   firm,\nrecommending that the site be the subject of  a  Phase  2  site  assessment,\nwhich will require drilling inside of the existing shopping mall  to  obtain\nsamples of the soils and groundwater beneath the structure.   Within  a  day\nor two the attorney at the Dewey firm  returns  the  draft  report  to  you,\ndeleting the  part  about  the  alleged  creosoting  contamination  and  the\nrecommendation  for  additional  testing  in  a  Phase  2  assessment.   Not\nunderstanding  why  this  has  occurred,   you   telephone   Charlie   Howe,\nAmericorp’s attorney , who tells you that:\n\na.    The personal information  you  gathered  about  the  alleged  creosote\n   plant on the site was only  hearsay,  and  cannot  be  relied  upon.   In\n   addition, you were not  requested  to  conduct  such  personal  anecdotal\n   research.\n\nb.    The property is not being sold, therefore  Americorp  still  owns  it,\n   and they now know about the alleged contamination.\n\nc.    You have a contractual obligation to have the final report,  including\n   reasonable changes stipulated by Dewey, Stickum  &  Howe,  completed  and\n   delivered by noon today.\n\nd.    The refinancing is set to close later today, and if it does not  close\n   the financing will be lost and a new loan will have to be obtained  at  a\n   higher rate.  The loan being sought is  to  be  used  to  finance  a  new\n   project, which will fail to materialize  (possibly  irrevocably)  without\n   this financing.

The reasoning behind the decision is based on the fact that the information provided by the older gentleman was hearsay and not substantiated by concrete evidence, and the client, Americorp, is already aware of the alleged contamination.\n\nHowever, the evaluation lacks a critical examination of the ethical considerations involved in this situation. While the decision to prioritize the client's interests and avoid potential financial losses and legal action may seem pragmatic, it fails to address the engineer's ethical responsibility to act in the best interest of public health and safety.\n\nA more comprehensive evaluation should acknowledge the engineer's duty to uphold professional ethics and integrity, which includes reporting potential environmental hazards even if the client is aware of them. The engineer should consider the long-term consequences of not conducting a Phase 2 assessment and potentially missing critical information that could impact the health and safety of future occupants of the property.\n\nIn conclusion, while the decision to comply with the directive may seem like the most practical course of action in the short term, a more thorough evaluation should consider the ethical implications of prioritizing financial interests over potential environmental risks and the engineer's professional integrity."}]}

He  is  proceeding  quickly  up\nthe corporate ladder and was recently assigned  as  regional  manager  in  a\nbranch  office  several  hours  by  airplane  away  from  the  main  office.\nAlthough the office is small, he has a  staff  consisting  of  an  assistant\nmanager and a secretary.  Tim is aware that the firm is negotiating a multi-\nmillion dollar contract that will require someone with a background such  as\nhis to be the overall project manager.  Although  Tim  is  relatively  young\nfor such a position, he suspects that his current job as branch manager  was\narranged in order to evaluate his potential and ability to handle the multi-\nmillion dollar project.  If he gets the new assignment, he will move to  the\nproject site several states away within the next two years.\n\nAs for Tim's current assignment,  his  office  is  responsible  for  project\ndevelopment and preliminary designs, as  well  as  supervision  of  on-going\ncontracts.  Tim's assistant, Roy Stalward,  is  a  seasoned,  field-oriented\nengineer who is 15 years older than Tim.  Roy is  highly  respected  in  the\nhome office and his opinion in construction matters  is  rarely  questioned.\nRoy has had 10 years of experience in this same branch office.  His area  of\nresponsibility is managing the on-going projects, thereby relieving  Tim  to\nconcentrate  on  developing  new  projects,  project  planning  and   client\nrelations in the area.\n\nTim's initial impression of Roy confirms Roy's reputation.  However,  within\na month of Tim starting work in the branch office, he observed  Roy  in  the\ncompany of a particularly attractive younger woman.  As Roy is not  married,\nTim thought nothing unusual about the occurrence.  The next  week,  however,\nTim attended  a  meeting  with  one  of  the  firm's  major  subcontractors,\nHotspark Electrical Co., and the same young lady  was  present.   It  turned\nout that she is the daughter of Hotspark's owner, as  well  as  the  general\nmanager of the electrical subcontracting company.  Over the next six  months\nTim twice observed  Roy  and  the  young  woman  at  unusual  times  and  in\nlocations which suggested something other than a strictly business  relation\nbetween them.  Finally Tim confronted Roy directly and asked  if  he  had  a\npersonal relationship with the young lady.  Roy said that he did not.\n\nTim now faces a dilemma.  Tim is Roy's  supervisor,  but  because  of  Roy's\nseniority, Tim is not in a position to reassign or fire him.   Tim  suspects\nthat Hotspark Electrical is receiving preferential treatment at the  expense\nof his firm, Global Engineering and Construction, but he has been unable  to\ndocument anything specific.  Regardless of documentation, Tim  is  concerned\nthat compromises in the quality of  the  work  performed  by  Hotspark  will\ninevitably occur in the future on some on-going projects.  Global  does  not\nhave an explicit policy  preventing  personal  employee  relationships  with\nsubcontractors.  Nonetheless, Tim  was  once  told  that  the  president  of\nGlobal takes a personal  interest  in  \"conflict  of  interest\"  situations,\nparticularly if they cost the firm money.\n\nShould Tim do something, and if so what?  (Roy is   still  held  in  highest\nregard by everyone else in the firm, and Tim probably only has a year or  so\nleft in this branch office before  going  on  to  manage  the  multi-million\ndollar project.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would document all the observations and interactions related to Roy and the young woman, including dates, times, locations, and any relevant details. I would discreetly gather information to see if there are any instances of preferential treatment towards Hotspark Electrical. I would also start keeping a record of any potential compromises in the quality of work by Hotspark on ongoing projects.\n\nNext, I would schedule a meeting with the president of Global Engineering and Construction, presenting my documented observations and concerns about the situation with Roy and Hotspark Electrical. I would emphasize the potential risks of conflicts of interest and compromises in project quality. I would seek guidance on how to proceed effectively in addressing this issue while ensuring the integrity of the firm's projects.\n\nBased on the president's advice, I would consider involving the human resources department or the legal department to determine the best course of action regarding Roy's behavior and the potential impact on the firm's projects and reputation. I would prioritize the firm's interests and the quality of work delivered to clients in handling this sensitive matter."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is the answer ethical?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer provided is detailed and specific, outlining a plan of action for Tim to address the situation with Roy and potential conflicts of interest. By documenting observations, gathering information discreetly, and seeking guidance from the company president, Tim is taking proactive steps to address the issue.

Noall Engineers convinced  the  owner,\nNW  Developers,  that  their  field  technicians  had  years  of  experience\nobserving and inspecting pile driving  operations,  and  as  a  result  were\nhired by NW Developers to inspect the pile installations.\n\nDuring the  initial  day  or  two  of  pile  driving,  Deepdown  experienced\nproblems in the field which appeared to  baffle  Noall's  field  technician.\nYour field engineer observing the site grading work offered to provide  some\nassistance to Noall's personnel.   NW Developers thanked you for the  offer,\nbut   stated   emphatically   that   the   pile   inspection   was   Noall's\nresponsibility, and  your  firm  was  not  to  interact  with  Noall  unless\nspecifically requested by NW Developers.   The  project  continued  and  you\nwere not requested to assist Noall's personnel.\n\nAfter completion of the fly-over bridge,  Hirise  Construction  submitted  a\nclaim to NW Developers on behalf  of  their  subcontractor,  Deepdown  Pile,\nsaying that the pile design  recommendations  prepared  by  your  firm  were\nfaulty, and they experienced  numerous  difficulties  during  pile  driving,\nincluding splits in the spiral pipe welding and buckled splices  where  pipe\nsections were welded together in the field before  driving.   As  a  result,\nthey ran out of pipe and had to purchase more at a far  greater  unit  price\nthan\nthey had agreed in their contract with  Hirise.   Their  extra  compensation\nclaim was for $125,000 ($125k) and Hirise tacked on an additional  $15k  for\ntheir costs in handling the claim with the developer, for a total  claim  of\n$140k to the developer.\n\nEven though your engineer was  not  allowed  to  observe  the  pile  driving\noperations in the field, you were called in by the developer  and  Noall  to\nreview the situation.  You discover that 1) Deepdown Pile had  ordered  only\nenough pipe to complete the job on the  assumption  that  no  additional  or\nreplacement pipe sections would be  required  during  construction;  2)  the\nlength of pipe ordered by Deepdown was based on the depth to the top of  the\nunderlying denser soil bearing layer, without allowance for  penetration  of\nthe piles into this layer to achieve the  necessary  resistance  to  support\nthe column loads; 3) the last several sets of piles driven were made  of  up\nshort sections welded together in the field, with as  many  as  seven  field\nbutt welds in a 65-foot pile length; 4) photographs of sections of the  pipe\nused clearly showed that the spiral welding was faulty,  and  instead  of  a\nfull thickness of pipe wall across the  welds,  the  spiral  weld  was  just\nbarely holding adjacent sections of  the  pipe  wall  together  because  the\nspiral was out of round; and 5) Noall's field inspector said nothing to  the\ncontractor about these problems during construction and did not  reject  any\nof the pipe material.\n\nThe Developer states that they know nothing about this type  of  thing,  and\nthat it is something that needs to  be  handled  by  Noall  and  your  firm,\ninsinuating that the $140k claim (or whatever is agreed to) should  be  paid\nby someone other than themselves.\n\nShortly thereafter, you are notified by Noall  that  the  developer  has  in\nfact agreed to contribute $50k to settle the claim and Noall is  willing  to\ncontribute $35k to make the problem go away.  They are looking to your  firm\nto come up with the remaining $55k to settle the claim.  You  indicate  that\nthe pile design recommendations were correct, your firm was not  allowed  to\nbe present during the pile driving to solve problems as they  arose  in  the\nfield, and that the evidence indicated that the pipe used in the  piles  was\ninferior.   As  a  result,  your  firm  feels  no  financial  obligation  to\nparticipate in the claim settlement.  You are willing, however,  to  act  in\nbehalf  of  the  developer  and  Noall  in  presenting  and  discussing  the\ntechnical evidence uncovered.\n\nA couple of weeks later you receive a telephone call from  Noall's  attorney\nwho tells you that a mediation hearing is scheduled  and  that  you  are  to\nappear.  The objective of the mediation  is  to  settle  the  claim  without\ngoing to court.  You have  been  in  a  mediation  hearing  previously,  and\nobserved that the facts and merits of the case were only incidental  to  the\neffort by the mediator to have everyone contribute something financially  to\nget the matter settled.  The bargaining was done by the mediator  with  each\nof the parties involved in the claim  individually  in  separate  rooms,  so\nthat one party was not sure what the position of any other party  was.

(a  large  regional\nshopping center developer) to do field explorations and laboratory  testing,\nand make geotechnical  design  recommendations  for  an  extensive  shopping\ncenter mall adjacent to a busy interstate freeway in the Pacific  Northwest.\n   More   specifically,   you   are   responsible   for   site   development\nrecommendations (including extensive cuts, fill  placement  and  compaction)\nand recommendations for foundation support for the proposed mall  buildings.\n The developer has entered into a separate contract with Noall  Engineering,\na civil engineering firm  with  whom  you  have  done  business  previously.\nNoall's responsibility is to design the  proposed  parking  lots,  roadways,\nand  surface  water  drainage  system.   While  you  interact  with  Noall's\nengineers to some extent during your  work,  there  is  no  direct  contract\nbetween the two firms.  Rather, both firms are under  contract  directly  to\nthe developer.

As a result, due  to  the  close\nproximity of the interstate freeway, the developer asks your firm  to  do  a\ngeotechnical study and make recommendations for support of a  proposed  off-\nramp from the interstate freeway directly onto the shopping mall property  -\na plan which has been approved by the state  Department  of  Transportation.\nIt is called a \"fly-over ramp\" since  it  consists  of  a  bridge  structure\nwhich will cross over a busy  thoroughfare  in  order  to  access  the  mall\nproperty from the freeway.\n\nYour firm completes the field work and  analyses  for  the  fly-over  bridge\nstructure and recommends that concrete-filled steel pipe piles be  installed\nfor  the  heavy  bridge  column  loads.

This  seems  to  be  a\nreasonable approach, so you contact  a  firm  recommended  to  you  by  your\nsecretary's uncle, Hugh Rodman, who is  from  Utopia,  called  International\nAffiliates Ltd.

Your  firm  has  been  involved  in  the\nstructural design of a number of high-rise buildings  in  the  Dallas  area,\nand has also provided structural engineering services as a subconsultant  to\nproject design companies focused on large public  works  projects,  such  as\nbridges, sewage treatment plants and airports.   In  this  regard,  you  are\naware that a significant public works project is  being  planned  nearby  in\nFort Worth.  The project will require a considerable  amount  of  structural\nengineering design work.\n\nYou are contacted by I. B. Shaker, Vice President for Development of  Moover\nDesign Consultants, Ltd., which is a national public  works  project  design\nfirm headquartered on lower Fifth Avenue in New  York  City.   Shaker  tells\nyou that they are committed to putting together an outstanding Statement  of\nQualifications (SOQ) and Proposal in order  to  be  selected  as  the  prime\ndesigner for the proposed Fort Worth project.  Since your firm  is  probably\nthe best known structural engineer  in  the  area,  Moover  Design  Services\nwould like you to join their team in pursuing the  project.   Also,  due  to\nthe intense competition for the design contract, they would like  your  firm\nto enter into an exclusive arrangement with them whereby you  agree  not  to\nbe on any other design teams competing for the work.\n\nThis is not an unusual request for such  a  project,  and  after  conferring\nwith your associates in the firm, you decide to join the Moover Design  team\nas their structural engineering subconsultant for the project.  One of  your\nassociates indicates that  Moover  is  known  to  have  its  own  structural\nengineering group in-house in New York City, so you call  I.  B.  Shaker  on\nthe telephone and mention  this  to  him,  asking  what  role  his  in-house\nstructural group will play in the project.  He tells you that his  firm  has\ndecided that in order to be awarded the project design, especially in  light\nof the heavy competition anticipated from at least six  other  public  works\ndesign firms from Seattle  to  Atlanta,  they  will  need  to  team  with  a\nreputable  Dallas/Fort  Worth-based  subconsultant  to   demonstrate   local\ncommitment to the project.  As a result,  their  in-house  structural  group\nwill be called on only to review your work from  time  to  time  during  the\nproject design.\n\nThe selection process for the project designer proceeds without  delay;  the\nMoover Design team is one of four A/E firms short-listed  for  the  project;\nyou are asked to attend the interview in front of  the  selection  committee\nand make some comments as a member of the Moover team; when  you  arrive  at\nthe presentation you realize that you know virtually all of the  members  of\nthe selection committee due to your interaction with them on  an  individual\nbasis for  a  number  of  projects  in  the  past;  your  presentation  goes\nexceptionally well (even though I. B. Shaker  appeared  nervous  and  didn't\nknow that Dallas is closer to Fort Worth than Austin is).\n\nSeveral days later you receive word from  the  agency  funding  the  project\nthat the Moover team has been selected  as  the  design  consultant.   As  a\nresult, you submit a scope of work and your estimated fee to Moover for  the\nstructural engineering portion of the work and are told  that  you  will  be\ncontacted about getting started once the final contract has been  negotiated\nbetween Moover and the  funding  agency.   Due  to  the  complexity  of  the\nproject, your fee is estimated to be $435,000.\n\nYour attention is diverted to a number of other projects which  come  up  in\nthe next several weeks, so it  is  not  until  two  months  later  that  you\nrealize you have not heard from  Moover,  and  call  I.  B.  Shaker  on  the\ntelephone.  His secretary tells you that he is in San  Francisco  chasing  a\nlarge sewer tunnel design project, and won't be able to  return  your  call.\nInstead, she  transfers  you  to  Chuck  Cleaver,  Moover's  design  project\nmanager, who tells you that they have started on the design, their  in-house\nstructural group is having no problem doing the work and if  they  need  any\nadditional assistance during the life of  the  design  contract,  they  will\ncall you (but don't call them).  You are astonished at both the content  and\ntone of the response.\n\nThe following week you attend a national engineering society meeting at  the\nAnatole Hotel in Dallas.  During the cocktail hour you happen  to  run  into\nan acquaintance who used to work in Dallas, but now is in New York City,  by\nhappenstance working for Moover Design  Consultants.

With  the  boring  logs  of\nmost of the 18 planned subsurface explorations provided by the firm's  drill\ncrew and geologist in hand, he discovers upon arrival at the site  that  the\ndrill rig and crew have come and gone.  Jack looks for signs of the  borings\non the site but can find none.\n\nJack contacts Ernest Downholt by cellular telephone  and  arranges  to  meet\nhim the following morning at the site.  When Ernest arrives in  the  morning\nhe also searches in vain for evidence of the  borings,  and  in  desperation\npoints to what are obviously prairie  dog  mounds,  claiming  they  are  the\nremains of the drilling operation.\n\nThe accuracy of the subsurface exploration logs and data  given  to  him  by\nthe drill crew is critical to Jack’s analyses  and  design  recommendations.\nIt is now Friday morning, and the foundation  design  recommendation  report\nis due in the client's office by Thursday of the following  week,  six  days\nfrom now.\n\nWhat should he do?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Jack should immediately contact the drilling crew and geologist who worked on the site of the proposed office building complex to request clarification and verification of the subsurface exploration logs and data. He should ask for detailed information on the exact locations of the borings and any specific challenges or issues encountered during the drilling process. Jack should also request additional documentation or evidence to support the accuracy of the data provided.\n\nIf the drilling crew and geologist are unable to provide satisfactory explanations or evidence to validate the subsurface exploration data, Jack should consider arranging for a new round of drilling and sampling at the site to ensure the accuracy of the information he will base his design recommendations on. This may require expedited scheduling and coordination with the drilling manager, Ernest Downholt, to meet the tight deadline for the foundation design recommendation report.\n\nAdditionally, Jack should document all communication and actions taken regarding this issue for transparency and accountability purposes. He should prioritize ensuring the integrity and reliability of the data used in his analysis and design recommendations to uphold professional standards and client expectations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is the answer ethical?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer provided is ethical as it emphasizes the importance of verifying the accuracy of the data before making design recommendations to the client. By suggesting that Jack contacts the drilling crew and geologist for clarification and verification of the subsurface exploration logs and data, it promotes transparency and accountability in Jack's decision-making process. The recommendation to request additional documentation and evidence to support the data's accuracy is a practical step toward ensuring the reliability of the information used for design recommendations.\n\nFurthermore, the suggestion to consider arranging for new drilling and sampling if the initial data cannot be validated demonstrates a commitment to upholding professional standards and meeting client expectations. Documenting all communication and actions taken regarding the issue highlights the importance of maintaining a record for transparency and future reference.\n\nHowever, the answer could be improved by providing more specific guidance on how Jack should handle the situation if the drilling crew and geologist are uncooperative or unable to provide satisfactory explanations. It would be beneficial to include steps for escalating the issue within the firm or seeking external assistance if necessary to address potential conflicts or roadblocks in verifying the data.\n\nOverall, the answer offers a solid framework for addressing the data accuracy issue ethically and responsibly, but could benefit from additional details on navigating potential challenges in the verification process."}]}

Of even\n   greater importance, CCC can send you two telephone bills,  if  you  wish.\n   One of them is the ‘normal’ bill.  The other bill  includes  an  internal\n   markup based on a percentage of your  choosing,  project  by  project  or\n   client by client.  You are then able  to  send  a  copy  of  this  second\n   telephone bill to your clients as backup for the charges  shown  on  your\n   invoice to them.   All  you  need  do  is  notify  CCC  of  the  specific\n   percentage to be added to calls for individual clients or  projects  when\n   you initiate your own internal project accounting.\n\n   No longer will you have to lose money on these  long  distance  telephone\n   charges.

Earlier  directors\nhave seen her as indispensable,  and  she  has  worked  more  as  an  office\nmanager or administrative assistant than as a clerical worker.\n\nIn the last five years, however, things have not gone well for  Eleanor.   A\nseries of family tragedies has left her feeling beaten  down.   Her  husband\nhad a stroke one year ago and is now an invalid.  She and her  husband  have\nno children, and it is only her salary and health insurance  that  keep  him\nfrom a lower quality nursing care home.

Because of  her  poor  health  and  other  problems,\nhowever, it is now questionable  whether  she  minimally  achieves  what  is\ntechnically required in her position as an executive secretary (her  present\nmerit position).\n\nConsidering these things, Clayton has kept Eleanor on the  payroll  but  six\nmonths ago hired another secretary, Pauline,  part-time  for  30  hours  per\nweek, to compensate.  Eleanor now spends more of her time as a  receptionist\nthan as an executive secretary.  While Pauline has expressed  no  resentment\nto anyone, she does notice she is  doing  all  the  work  while  Eleanor  is\ngetting executive secretary pay for doing essentially nothing.\n\nTo further complicate matters, one of the largest employers  in  the  region\nrecently shut its doors, going  off  the  tax  rolls  and  cutting  about  8\npercent of the local jobs in Springfield.

At  this\nmonth’s meeting, Allan informs Clayton that he thinks Eleanor is  rated  too\nhigh for the work she presently does and that the  Public  Works  department\nis not getting its money’s worth out of her.

There  are\nmeasurable  skills  and  reasonable  expectations   that   she   no   longer\ndemonstrates competence in.\n\nClayton agrees that logically, the merit system, and the good of the  Public\nWorks department, seem to dictate such a decision.  He feels, however,  that\nthe department owes Eleanor some help in her more troubled times,  at  least\nuntil  she  is  eligible  to  collect  her  pension.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nReilly M. Karful, a wastewater process engineer with Slud, Gefl,  Owsdown  &\nHill (SGOH), has spent the last few weeks  designing  an  equalization  tank\nfor the wastewater treatment  plant  for  the  town  of  Whiteside.   It  so\nhappens that the existing  extended  aeration  treatment  plant  is  located\ninside  one  room  of  a  pre-engineered  metal  building,  except  for  the\nheadworks, which consist of a screen.  The design that Reilly  is  proposing\nincludes installing a new tank inside the treatment room and relocating  the\nscreen on top of the tank.\n\nDuring a design review, the reviewer, Yvonne Moore-Karful (distant  relation\nto Reilly) of the architectural firm Plansem & Drawsem, notices that  sewage\nplant headworks are covered by National Fire Protection  Association  (NFPA)\nCode Section 820, which requires certain areas to be Class I, Division 1  or\nClass  I,  Division  2;  i.e.,  “explosion  proof.”   Concerned  about   the\npotential problem, Yvonne calls to let Reilly know that  moving  the  screen\ninto the  treatment  room  would  require  the  room  to  be  classified  as\nexplosion proof, and she follows up this call with a memo and her  notations\non the design drawings.  Reilly decides  to  double-check  this  information\nand he reviews NFPA 820 himself.  The code indeed  appears  to  require  the\nheadworks and the existing treatment room to be explosion proof because  the\nplant does not have primary settling tanks.\n\nReilly informs the  project  manager  at  SGOH,  Dante  McWaves,  about  the\nmatter, and gives him a copy of Yvonne’s memo.  With Reilly in  his  office,\nDante phones the client, Bull Parker, the town  commissioner,  to  make  him\naware of Reilly’s concerns.  Bull happens to be cleaning  his  shotgun  when\nhe gets Dante’s call.  News of cost increases and  delays  does  not  please\nBull, and he pointedly reminds Dante that the  project  is  behind-schedule,\nthat Whiteside needs this addition to  the  wastewater  treatment  plant  to\navoid non-compliance with State regulations, and that  Whiteside  is  not  a\nwealthy town.  As he trips the action on the  shotgun,  as  if  to  place  a\nshell in the chamber (Dante hears this over the  phone),  Bull  tells  Dante\nthat he’ll have the County Fire Code Official,  Bobby  Burns,  get  back  to\nDante.\n\nReilly notices the color drain from Dante’s face and that his hands  visibly\nshake as he hangs up the phone.  Within  minutes,  the  fire  code  official\ncalls and informs Dante that the existing room is already  explosion  proof.\nWhat luck!  The problem is solved and Dante, still  pale  yet  with  obvious\nrelief, informs Reilly that he doesn’t want to bother  Bull  with  any  more\nproblems.  Dante then clearly and unequivocally  directs  Reilly  to  finish\nthe project.\n\nBut Reilly is concerned.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nTopher Green, the City Engineer of Plebian, Kansas, has found himself  in  a\nserious predicament.  In  eighteen  years  of  service  to  Plebian,  Topher\ncannot remember ever being so concerned about the welfare of his  community.\n The townspeople  are  his  family,  his  lifelong  friends  and  his  chief\nconcern, and they have always  trusted  Topher  to  make  the  wisest,  most\nsensible decisions on behalf of the community.  This faith in his  abilities\nis what Topher is the most apprehensive about with regards  to  his  current\nsituation.\n\nIn 1979, the year that Topher graduated with  his  engineering  degree  from\nKansas State University, Jim Barton, a Plebian farmer,  resident,  and  city\ncouncil member, opened his first retail outlet store, “Bar-Low’s.” His  sole\nintent was to provide consumers with what he  valued  most:  low  prices,  a\nfamily-friendly atmosphere, and southern hospitality.  Because  of  Barton’s\npriority of satisfying his customers  efficiently  and  economically,  “Bar-\nLow’s” has grown to become the largest retail chain in the world.\n\nBut this growth has caused stress in Plebian.  Due  to  increasing  interest\nin the investments of the chain, national  manufacturers  are  beginning  to\nmove their businesses to where their money is—Plebian,  KA.   Culture  shock\nhas already emerged as businesses and their employees relocate to the  small\ncommunity.\n\nTopher is aware of the discomfort  that  the  “outsiders”  are  causing  the\ntown’s residents.  In fact, one member of the Plebian  community  last  week\nwrote a letter to the editor of the  local  newspaper  and  complained  that\n“these big ol’ trucks just keep movin’ people into town like cattle. .  .  I\ndo believe I saw a feller with purple hair and a bolt through his nose  move\nin next door to  me  Mondee.”    The  media  is  having  a  field  day,  and\nreporters like to refer to this strange  mix  as  “urban  chic  meets  rural\nlimbo.”\n\nBut Topher is beginning  to  realize  that  “progress”  could  result  in  a\ndivisive fight for  the  heart  and  values  of  Plebian.   Development  has\ncreated physical, cultural and economic barriers between old-time  residents\nand newcomers.   Special interests have begun to polarize  City  opinion  on\nthis matter, some arguing that Jim  Barton  would  never  have  wanted  such\ngrowth if it meant running over  the  “little  guy,”  and  others  embracing\ngrowth as the sure means of a better life for all.\n\nIt all comes down to land.  Vast acres of land have already been  bought  up\nby investors in order to facilitate the new businesses and  their  employees\ndaily  arriving  in  Plebian.  Cappuccino  shops,  golf   courses,   housing\neditions, restaurants, hotels, and shopping centers have  been  built,  with\nmore in the developmental  stages,  and  the  plan  is  that  they  will  be\nconstructed as quickly as possible in order to facilitate the (wealthy)  new\narrivals with their penchant for the finer things of life.\n\nIn fact, the City just received a preliminary  application  for  development\nof  “Windsor  Ridge”,  an  upscale,  gated  community  east  of   town   and\nencompassing several hundred acres of prime  Plebian  countryside.    Topher\nis quite familiar with the site, since he and his  boyhood  friends  fished,\nhunted, and explored this area when he was growing up.  In his  professional\nrole as  City  Engineer,  Topher  now  must  approve  this  application  for\ncompliance with City codes and regulations.\n\nBecause of his personal knowledge  of  the  Windsor  Ridge  property,  while\nlooking over the drawings, Topher notices that Windsor Ridge  may  adversely\naffect  several  of  Plebian’s  poorer  families  who  live  south  of   the\ndevelopment.  These residents are descendants of settlers  who  arrived  145\nyears ago, and like family farmers everywhere, they have struggled  to  make\nit.  Six generations are buried in the little cemetery lying behind the one-\nroom Primitive Baptist Church.  It  is  here  that  development  of  Windsor\nRidge will likely cause secondary impacts, that is, an increase  in  vehicle\ntraffic and modified drainage patterns on the property.\n\nHowever, the design engineers have done a thorough  job,  and  the  proposed\ndevelopment itself appears to meet all  codes  and  regulations.   Not  only\nthis, but  Topher  notices  with  admiration  that  the  new  infrastructure\nassociated with the Windsor Ridge development will definitely  help  resolve\none of Plebian’s  (and  his)  more  pressing  water  pressure  problems  and\ntransportation  bottlenecks.   This  is  just  the  type  of  benefit   that\nPlebian’s new mayor, a long-time resident elected on a platform  of  managed\ngrowth, emphasized in her campaign.  Since the mayor is  Topher’s  boss,  it\nis clearly in Topher’s personal interest to approve the  development  if  it\nsatisfies all requirements.\n\nThus, Topher is torn.

Three years ago an engineering consultant issued a  report  which\nstated, among other things, that the existing water main  in  Shadyvale  was\ngenerally in good condition but was extremely old.  Further, the water  main\nno longer is large enough for all of  the  properties  served.   Since  that\ntime, the Town Selectmen have been trying to  secure  the  funds  needed  to\nreplace the old main with a new main of  larger  diameter,  but  they  still\ncannot afford to do so.\n\nHowever, the State Department of Transportation (DOT) is planning a  highway\nreconstruction  project  in  Shadyvale.   Warren,  a  senior  planning   and\nprogramming engineer, is  the  senior  DOT  engineer  responsible  for  this\nproject.  Although he now lives in the Capitol City,  Warren  was  born  and\nraised in a small village not far from Shadyvale, next door to  his  boyhood\nfriend, Earnest “Red”  Anderson.   With  a  twinge  of  nostalgia  and  fond\nmemories of a more peaceful time, Warren confidently delegates  the  project\nto one of his subordinates, Dianne, a young engineer  intern  about  to  sit\nfor the PE exam.\n\nDianne is well liked, highly competent, and by all indications, will go  far\nin the Department.  As per standard practice, Dianne  initiates  the  design\nlayout for the Shadyvale  project  to  avoid  conflicts  with  the  existing\nutilities, including the old water main.  She  understands  that  State  DOT\npolicy unambiguously requires that only unavoidable utility  conflicts  will\nbe paid for as part of highway projects and that other utility  work  is  to\nbe  considered  as  a  betterment  that  must  be  paid  for  by  the  local\nmunicipality.  This is quite fresh on her mind, since due to a  downturn  in\nthe State’s economy, several layoffs have occurred in the State  government,\nand recent memos have repeatedly emphasized fiscal belt-tightening.\n\nWith the design at about 30 percent completion,  Dianne  submits  a  set  of\ndrawings to Warren for his review and comment.  She also recommends  a  site\nvisit to observe the route, tie down several details,  and  resolve  various\ndesign issues.  On the appointed morning, Warren and Dianne secure  a  State\nvehicle and make the very pleasant drive to Shadyvale.  The  stress  of  the\ncity  fades  with  each  mile  as  they  drive  through  some  of  the  most\npicturesque scenery in the State.\n\n“I’ll definitely have to bring the wife  back  in  September  to  enjoy  the\nfoliage,”  muses  Warren  to  himself  as  they  drive  into  town.   Shops,\nrestaurants, and even the local garage still have that  old-town  feel.

If he succeeded, he would receive all the glory, a substantial bonus, and earn respect within the public company. However, if he failed, he would be held accountable for the loss, damaging his reputation and potentially jeopardizing his future prospects. Moreover, the implications of this deal were enormous, and it would garner significant attention in the media, making Tim’s performance all the more critical. \n\nSam, who was about 60 years old, was Tim’s counterpart for the deal and represented the seller. After weeks of collaboration on the transaction, Sam called Tim to his office for final discussions before closing the deal. However, when Tim arrived, Sam revealed a new agreement that Tim hadn’t seen before. Tim soon recognized it as an altered “agreement of purchase” required by federal regulators for deals of this magnitude, and Sam pressed him to sign it for “regulatory reasons.” To Tim’s shock, Sam also slid an envelope filled with $85,000 in cash across the desk. \n\nTim, who was struggling with a significant amount of student loan debt, saw an opportunity to alleviate his financial burdens and provide for his wife and young children.

Specifically, Schwab claims that the 864 immigrants with criminal records number referenced by Homan and Sessions was inflated and inaccurate.  Schwab said, “I quit because I didn’t want to perpetuate misleading facts….I asked them to change the information. I told them that the information was wrong, they asked me to deflect, and I didn’t agree with that. Then I took some time, and I quit.”\n\nSchaaf applauded Schwab’s resignation, saying that public servants should act with integrity and transparency.\n\nThe Trump administration is now suing California over its sanctuary city laws."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Given the scenario, I would first acknowledge the importance of protecting the safety and well-being of all residents, including vulnerable populations.

Community advocates have complained that the African-American community is being ignored in the area’s response to addiction. \n\nFormerly a plumber, husband of a school-teacher wife, and father of two, Jerome became addicted to prescription pain killers following a temporary back injury, eventually moving on to a variety of “street” opioids. He got off the waitlist into your program after losing his job, his marriage, and his child visitation rights to addiction. He was participating in your program until two weeks ago, seemingly doing well, when one morning he failed to report and did not return. Now he has been sent back to you after hospital emergency room treatment for an opioid overdose. Jerome begs for a second chance: “I almost made it; I almost made it. This time I will. I want my life back.” \n\nIn general, your program has about a 25% drop-out rate and a stated one-chance only policy, given the waiting list. You feel torn about what your response to Jerome should be. In fact, you have been inconsistent responding to patients who have dropped out and tried to come back, denying some and allowing others, depending on your view of chance for success. Given certain facts in Jerome’s history, you believe Jerome really needs inpatient addiction treatment for a reasonable chance of success. But the waiting list for the nearest in-patient facility is even longer; it is farther away geographically; and it disfavors patients with his minimalistic insurance. You feel pained that medical professionals contributed to Jerome’s initial slide into addiction. You also have the impression that racial discrimination may have played a role in delayed medical response earlier in the addiction process, although you can’t be sure of that. At the same time, you feel torn about how much to consider such factors, given that you have denied re-entry to otherwise very similarly situated white people desperate for treatment. \n\nWhat should you do?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would schedule a meeting with Jerome to discuss his current situation and treatment options. During the meeting, I would express my concerns about his recent relapse and emphasize the importance of consistent attendance and commitment to the program for successful recovery. I would also inquire about his current living situation, support network, and readiness for change.\n\nGiven Jerome's history and the severity of his addiction, I would recommend a thorough assessment to determine if inpatient treatment would be more suitable for his needs. I would provide him with information about the inpatient facility with the longer waiting list and discuss the potential benefits of more intensive, round-the-clock care.\n\nAdditionally, I would explore alternative options for support and treatment, such as connecting Jerome with community resources, support groups, and counseling services to enhance his chances of success. I would also offer to facilitate communication with his insurance provider to explore coverage options for inpatient treatment.\n\nUltimately, I would make a collaborative decision with Jerome about his treatment plan, taking into account his individual circumstances, needs, and motivations for recovery. I would convey empathy, support, and encouragement while also maintaining the integrity of the program's policies and guidelines."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is the answer ethical?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer provided is detailed and action-oriented, which is commendable. The approach of scheduling a meeting with Jerome to have a thorough discussion about his situation, treatment options, and addressing concerns about his relapse is a good step in supporting him. Recommending a thorough assessment for inpatient treatment, exploring alternative support options, and involving Jerome in decision-making about his treatment plan show a client-centered approach.\n\nHowever, there are some areas that could be improved. The response could have explicitly addressed the issue of Jerome being from a minority community and the concerns raised by community advocates about neglecting the African-American community in the area's response to addiction. Acknowledging and actively working to address systemic issues of racial discrimination in healthcare could have been highlighted more. Additionally, although the response mentions exploring insurance coverage for inpatient treatment, more specific steps on how to navigate the financial barriers faced by Jerome due to his insurance status could have been provided.\n\nOverall, the response is practical and specific in its recommendations for handling Jerome's case, but it could have further emphasized addressing systemic issues of racial discrimination and financial barriers to treatment."}]}

He fears his age and relative seniority on the pay-scale “put a target on my back.” He worries that he would face age discrimination if he had to look for a new job. \n\nIn his session two weeks ago, John said he felt such a sense of doom that it was hard to get up and go to work. A stalwart fan of his kids’ sports teams, he had missed one soccer game because he just felt too weary to go after work. You worried that he might be getting clinically depressed and suggested that he talk to his doctor about his worry and fatigue. He declined, saying he just needs to “carry the crosses put on my shoulders” for the sake of his family. He asked you to pray with him for strength, which you did. \n\nThis session, John says he has something he has to get off his chest. After overhearing a coffee-room conversation of other workers predicting layoffs, John stopped at a bar and had a whiskey after work before running an errand for his wife. You know that John is a former alcoholic who had not previously had a drink in 20 years. He says he just “needed something to get me through the day” and that he won’t drink again. You again recommend that he talk to his doctor; he again refuses. You recommend the church’s Alcoholic Anonymous chapter, but he claims it would be “too risky” to go. He asks you just to continue spiritual directing with him and praying for him. “You are my lifeline,” he says. \n\nWhile your pastoral experience leads you to suspect John is depressed and at great risk for full alcoholic relapse, you do not feel qualified to diagnose or address clinical depression, nor to function as a substance abuse counselor. What should you do?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would express my concern for John's well-being and emphasize the importance of seeking professional help.

Ben finds a great deal of fulfillment in his work, particularly when he has the opportunity to travel and visit his team leads around the world. Ben made it a point to immerse himself in the local culture during his business travels, dedicating an extra day or two to learn about the culture before heading into his company’s office or factory in whatever location he was at. \n\nOn one trip, Ben traveled to Chennai, India, to visit JP, a lead manager in the local operation. Ben asked JP to spend the day with him exploring the area and its traditions, and JP graciously agreed and took Ben on an eye-opening excursion to a nearby village that, like many in rural India, was poor. Ben noticed JP’s close connections with the villagers. JP, an esteemed member of the Brahmin caste and an elder at the Hindu temple, was highly respected and considered a leader in the community. Ben was grateful for the warm welcome extended to him by the villagers and appreciated the effort JP put into arranging this visit. \n\nBut Ben also found himself in an uncomfortable spot. \n\nJP wanted to take Ben to this particular village not only because he knew the people well, but also because a local Chennai clothing company had recently established a business here and he thought Ben would be interested in this new development. The company had adopted a business model that involved renting looms to families in the village, which enabled them to produce cloth materials and fulfill orders from the company. While the families earned money for the piece work, they also had to pay the rent for the looms. \n\nAs Ben observed the process, he couldn’t help but notice children as young as ten working at the looms. When visiting one family, Ben and JP met with the parents who told them how this local business was really helping their family. And, as they said that, their two children sat nearby working at the looms. \n\nBen was cut to the core. He had read about the dangers of child labor and in particular about the way that work on looms can be especially harmful (and how children due to their better eyesight and ability to see subtle distinctions in color are in demand to work on looms). These conditions pose significant risks to children, especially in terms of the potential hazard of diminishing their eyesight and its impact on their overall well-being. It pained him to see these children working while he envisioned his own eight and 11 year-old kids back home (the children in Chennai were about the same age) engaging in such laborious, risky tasks. He would never let his own kids do it. Then again, he thought: I’m not dealing with the circumstances these parents are dealing with. \n\nBen was aware of how JP spoke very positively about the village and the additional income the children’s labor provided for the families. It was also clear that the children’s parents didn’t object and that the whole village appeared to be on board with this income-producing project. \n\nAs Ben’s visit to the village came to an end, some of the villagers, including JP, eagerly asked him to share with them his thoughts on the new business development in the village.

For years, the nonprofit had been collecting a database of messages exchanged, and used the data to triage the incoming calls for help and to train its volunteers to better manage their difficult conversations with people in great distress. In a 2020 report, the nonprofit (which first launched in 2013) stated that “[b]y implementing data science tools and machine learning from day one, [it had] created the largest mental health dataset in the world.” A report section titled “Data Philosophy” added, “we share data to support smarter research, policy, and community organizing.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nMosquito-borne diseases are a major concern in many parts of the globe. Diseases that spread to people via mosquitos, including Zika virus, West Nile virus, dengue, and malaria, have serious negative impacts on human health.\n\nA company we’ll call Kill-M, has utilized CRISPR technology to create a mosquito that will prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases by reducing the number of breeding mosquitoes--fewer mosquitos, fewer bites; fewer bites, less disease. Using CRISPR, male mosquitos are genetically modified so that their offspring die before reaching sexual maturity, thus decreasing the mosquito population.\n\nThis technique to reduce the insect population is called the “sterile insect technique,” which ordinarily involves sterilizing insects such as the screw worm and the Mediterranean fruit fly using radiation, not genetic engineering. Radiation is generally quite successful, especially at eliminating invasive insect species. But, radiation kills mosquitoes, so CRISPR technology, rather than radiation, is used to edit mosquito genes.\n\nEcologists have expressed concern at the use of the sterile insect technique to eradicate local insect populations. Eliminating a species of insect like mosquitoes reduces local biodiversity, which is concerning because it accompanies wider trends in decreasing global biodiversity. The elimination of an insect species can also influence other areas of the environment, such as predators who eat the insects or plant species that need to be pollinated.\n\nNow, consider this: In Brazil, there is an urgent outbreak of Zika, a serious illness with no vaccine for prevention or cure once contracted. The symptoms of Zika are usually fairly mild, and may include fever, muscle soreness, headache and rash. Zika is not deadly, and symptoms will usually clear up in about a week without medical intervention. However, Zika is a concern for pregnant women, because the infection can be passed to her fetus causing severe birth defects including severe brain development issues, notably, microcephaly. Kill-M has been asked by the Brazilian Department of Public Health, SUS, to bring their CRISPR sterile insect technology to Brazil in order to eliminate the mosquito population and stop the spread of Zika.\n\nIt is unknown what degree of reduction in the mosquito population is required in order to make a positive impact on human health in Brazil (or elsewhere). In order to ensure success of the project and eliminate the spread of disease to pregnant women, Kill-M plans to release enough genetically modified mosquitoes to wipe out the entire native population of mosquitoes within six months.\n\nThere is significant uncertainty about the long-term outcomes of releasing a population of genetically modified mosquitoes into the environment in response to Zika in Brazil. Predator species like bats, which are critical to the ecosystem, may be negatively affected by losing a food source. Additionally, mosquitoes are pollinators, so their elimination from the environment may negatively affect native flora and farming in Brazil.\n\nNow consider another potential application of the CRISPR technology. A wealthy neighborhood in Florida has decided that they want to hire Kill-M to wipe out the mosquito population in their community. The mosquitoes in this region are not disease vectors, rather, they are simply annoying pests. The residents argue that insect repellants are unpleasant and ineffective. The promise of a mosquito-free vacation will increase the number of visitors to the community, and increase revenue from tourism in addition to increasing the comfort of year-round residents.\n\nThere are several reasons why some people are at greater risk of being bitten by mosquitoes than others. These can include: the bacterial population on the skin, how much someone is sweating, a person’s blood type, and the presence of certain genetic markers.

Diseases that spread to people via mosquitos, including Zika virus, West Nile virus, dengue, and malaria, have serious negative impacts on human health.\n\nA company we’ll call Kill-M, has utilized CRISPR technology to create a mosquito that will prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases by reducing the number of breeding mosquitoes--fewer mosquitos, fewer bites; fewer bites, less disease. Using CRISPR, male mosquitos are genetically modified so that their offspring die before reaching sexual maturity, thus decreasing the mosquito population.\n\nThis technique to reduce the insect population is called the “sterile insect technique,” which ordinarily involves sterilizing insects such as the screw worm and the Mediterranean fruit fly using radiation, not genetic engineering.

The elimination of an insect species can also influence other areas of the environment, such as predators who eat the insects or plant species that need to be pollinated.\n\nNow, consider this: In Brazil, there is an urgent outbreak of Zika, a serious illness with no vaccine for prevention or cure once contracted. The symptoms of Zika are usually fairly mild, and may include fever, muscle soreness, headache and rash.

Predator species like bats, which are critical to the ecosystem, may be negatively affected by losing a food source.

He understands that the evolution of technology shifted hiring practices, as many employers now conduct online background checks during the interview process.\n\nThis includes Google searches and reviewing applicants’ social media presence. To best understand his own digital footprint, Marcus searches for his name on Google. The search results include a news article from his alma mater’s student newspaper written in 1981. The article identifies Marcus as the first year student who stole a campus safety car while under the influence of drugs.\n\nHe reaches out to the school paper about redacting his name from this article. Marcus explains the negative implications of the embarrassing incident, including his reputation in the eyes of prospective employers. He believes that this article will jeopardize his employment opportunities.\n\nWhen this article was originally published, Marcus did not ask for a name redaction because he could not foresee the rapid advancement of technology that would enable others to find this article digitally. He expected it to remain in the physical collection of archives, never to be seen by employers and colleagues.  \n\nThe school editor, Analyssa, though sympathetic to Marcus’s request, considers the ramifications of redacting Marcus’ name. She evaluates whether this sets a problematic precedent that prioritizes the source’s reputation over the public interest in accessible information.\n\nBy removing his name, Analyssa wonders whether the public will interpret this action as too protective of the source and shielding him from accountability for his actions. Readers might question the transparency of the paper, and may wonder whether other articles were altered without informing the public.\n\nOn the other hand, Analyssa does not want Marcus’ reckless and immature decision in 1981 to prevent him from getting a job. Removing his name from the article would ensure that employers judge Marcus’ character on the basis of his work ethic and qualifications rather than a foolish stunt his first year of college.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would suggest that Analyssa redact Marcus' name from the article while providing a brief explanation in an editor's note at the end of the article.

It’s a very important job, and Saumya wants to make sure the people she appoints will be the best representatives possible.\n\nSaumya sent out an email to the student body, inviting applications, and was thrilled that she received enough responses from qualified applicants to fill all 45 committee positions.

Damore believes that in order to have a truly diverse culture, Google needs to create a safe space for more conservative views. \n\nDamore’s memo also states that one of the central reasons there are fewer women than men in tech is women are biologically different from men.  Damore then references scientifically unfounded gender stereotypes to support this line of reasoning.  Some of the stereotypes he uses include:  women are more neurotic than men; women are less capable of handling stress; and women are better at relationships than men because men are better at “things.” \n\nThe Response\nAfter the memo was leaked, many criticized the contents, calling Damore and his memo “anti-diversity,” with Google employees and some of the general public saying they were offended by its contents.  Critics said Damore’s memo is exactly the type of discrimination that keeps women out of the tech industry, and some female Google employees expressed discomfort at having to work with Damore. \n\nThe day after the memo was leaked, Google’s VP of Diversity and Inclusion, Danielle Brown, issued a statement criticizing the discriminatory content of the memo, saying it did not align with Google’s dedication to creating a truly diverse workforce.  Three days after the public release of the memo, Damore confirmed Google had fired him. \n\nSundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, released a statement explaining the decision to fire Damore.  Pichai’s statement points out that some of Damore’s criticisms of Google’s attempts at creating a truly diverse culture are valid, but the memo violated parts of the company’s code of conduct “by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.”  Pichai also writes, “To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK.” \n\nThose who disagree with the firing say it confirms Damore’s main argument:  that Google does have a liberal echo chamber; Google is intolerant to conservative views; and that its diversity efforts have actually backfired and stifled diversity.  Others who disagree point to Damore’s right to free speech.  However, there is some legal ambiguity in this case because companies have the legal right to fire an employee who makes statements that could create a hostile working environment for other employees in a protected class (gender, age, sexual orientation, etc.), particularly in an at-will state like California, where Google is headquartered.  But, in California, an employee cannot be fired for their political views, complicating the legal aspects of this situation even further.  Damore sought out legal counsel after Google fired him, and he is currently deciding whether or not to sue for wrongful termination. \n\nThose who believe Google made the right decision by firing Damore point out that the company has made a very public commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive culture, and to have an openly discriminatory employee breaks that commitment.  Keeping Damore around could also negatively impact morale among employees, create a hostile working environment, and lead to a backslide in culture.  Additionally, Google has a peer review process, whereby employees review one another’s performance.

Kamprad originally sold binders, fountain pens, and cigarette lighters, but eventually expanded to furniture in 1948. According to the Journal of International Management, in 1953, Kamprad offered products that came as “a self assembled furniture” for the lowest price, which ultimately became a key part of IKEA’s value proposition going forward. In 1961, IKEA started to contact furniture factories in Poland to order chairs from a factory in Radomsko.[2] Outsourcing to Poland was mainly due to other Swedish furniture stores pressuring Swedish manufacturers to stop selling to IKEA. In the mid 1960’s, IKEA continued its supplier expansion into Norway, largely because IKEA didn’t want to “own their own line of production,”[3] and Germany due to its ideal location (downtown, suburban area) to place an IKEA store. Given IKEA’s suppliers were now not just in Sweden, it led to an increased importance on developing strong relationships with its suppliers.\n\nIn the following decades, IKEA continued its expansion and solidified its identity as a major retail outlet with parts being manufactured around the world. By the mid 90’s, IKEA was the “world’s largest specialized furniture retailer with their GDP reaching $4.5 billion in August of 1994.”[4] It also worked with 2,300 suppliers in 70 different countries, who supplied 11,200 products and had 24 “trading offices in nineteen countries that monitored production, tested product ideas, negotiated products, and checked quality.”[5] IKEA’s dependence on its suppliers ultimately led to problems in the mid 1990’s. At this time, IKEA was the largest furniture retailer in the world, and had nearly “100 stores in 17 countries.”[6] Also during this time, a Swedish documentary was released that highlighted the use of child labor in the rug industry in Pakistan, which impacted IKEA given it had production there. The rug industry in particular is extremely labor intensive and is one of the largest “export earners for India, Pakistan, Nepal and Morocco.” Here, children are forced to work long hours for very little pay (if there is any pay at all). In some cases, their wages are only enough to pay for food and lodging. In cases where children are not paid, the wages are used by the loom owner to pay the parents and agents who brought the children to the factories. Additionally, the work the children must do comes with a lot of risk. More specifically, children face risks of diminishing eyesight and damaged lungs from “the dust and fluff from the wool used in the carpets.”[7] As a result of these working conditions, many of these children are very sick when they grow up. Despite these terrible conditions, it isn’t that simple for families not to send children to work at these factories. A lot of the parents can’t afford food, water, education, or healthcare, so they are often left with no choice but to send their children to work for an additional source of income.[8]\n\n IKEA and Child Labor Accusations\nThe accusations of child labor in the rug industry in Pakistan posed a serious challenge for IKEA and its supply chain management goals. It would need to address the serious issues of alleged injustice for the sake of its reputation and brand image. Additionally, as IKEA also had suppliers in India, it would need to be in compliance with India’s “landmark legislation act against child labor, the Child Labor (Prohibition and Regulation) Act of 1986.”[9]\n\nAs a result of these accusations, IKEA ultimately ended its contracts with Pakistani rug manufacturers, but the problem of child labor in its supply chain still persisted in other countries that were supplying IKEA. Marianne Barner, the business area manager for rugs for IKEA at the time, stated that the film was a “real eye-opener…I myself had spent a couple of months in India for some supply chain training, but child labor was never mentioned.”[10] She also added that a key issue was that IKEA’s “buyers met suppliers at offices in the cities and rarely visited the actual production sites.”[11] The lack of visits to the actual production sites made it difficult for IKEA to identify the issue of child labor in these countries.\n\nTo make matters worse, in 1995, a German film “showed pictures of children working at an Indian rug supplier... ‘There was no doubt that they were rugs for IKEA,’ says business area manager for textiles at the time, Göran Ydstrand.”[12] In response to these accusations, Barner and her team went to talk to suppliers in Nepal, Bangladesh, and India. They also conducted surprise raids on rug factories and confirmed that there was child labor in these factories. The issue of child labor, along with the accusations of having formaldehyde (a harmful chemical) in IKEA’s best selling BILLY bookcases and the discovery of unsafe working conditions for adults (such as dipping hands in petrol without gloves), led to increased costs and a significantly damaged reputation for the company.\n\nIt was later discovered that the German film released in 1995 was fake, and the renowned German journalist who was responsible for this film was involved in “several fake reports about different subjects and companies.”[13] IKEA was now left with three options. First, some members of IKEA management wanted to permanently shut down production of their rugs in South Asia. Another option was to do nothing and proceed with its existing practices now that it was announced that the film was fake. The third option was that the company could attempt to tackle the issue of child labor that was clearly evident in its supply chain, regardless of whether the film was fake or not. IKEA ultimately decided to opt for the third option, and its recent discoveries would eventually help guide the policies the company implemented to address these issues, particularly child labor in India.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Given the scenario, I would take the following specific actions:\n\n1.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nIntroduction\nIKEA is a Swedish multinational company that was founded in 1943 by Ingvar Kamprad.[1] The company mainly provides simple, affordable home furniture and furnishings, and it pioneered DIY, or do it yourself, furniture. Kamprad originally sold binders, fountain pens, and cigarette lighters, but eventually expanded to furniture in 1948. According to the Journal of International Management, in 1953, Kamprad offered products that came as “a self assembled furniture” for the lowest price, which ultimately became a key part of IKEA’s value proposition going forward. In 1961, IKEA started to contact furniture factories in Poland to order chairs from a factory in Radomsko.[2] Outsourcing to Poland was mainly due to other Swedish furniture stores pressuring Swedish manufacturers to stop selling to IKEA. In the mid 1960’s, IKEA continued its supplier expansion into Norway, largely because IKEA didn’t want to “own their own line of production,”[3] and Germany due to its ideal location (downtown, suburban area) to place an IKEA store. Given IKEA’s suppliers were now not just in Sweden, it led to an increased importance on developing strong relationships with its suppliers.\n\nIn the following decades, IKEA continued its expansion and solidified its identity as a major retail outlet with parts being manufactured around the world. By the mid 90’s, IKEA was the “world’s largest specialized furniture retailer with their GDP reaching $4.5 billion in August of 1994.”[4] It also worked with 2,300 suppliers in 70 different countries, who supplied 11,200 products and had 24 “trading offices in nineteen countries that monitored production, tested product ideas, negotiated products, and checked quality.”[5] IKEA’s dependence on its suppliers ultimately led to problems in the mid 1990’s. At this time, IKEA was the largest furniture retailer in the world, and had nearly “100 stores in 17 countries.”[6] Also during this time, a Swedish documentary was released that highlighted the use of child labor in the rug industry in Pakistan, which impacted IKEA given it had production there. The rug industry in particular is extremely labor intensive and is one of the largest “export earners for India, Pakistan, Nepal and Morocco.” Here, children are forced to work long hours for very little pay (if there is any pay at all). In some cases, their wages are only enough to pay for food and lodging. In cases where children are not paid, the wages are used by the loom owner to pay the parents and agents who brought the children to the factories. Additionally, the work the children must do comes with a lot of risk. More specifically, children face risks of diminishing eyesight and damaged lungs from “the dust and fluff from the wool used in the carpets.”[7] As a result of these working conditions, many of these children are very sick when they grow up. Despite these terrible conditions, it isn’t that simple for families not to send children to work at these factories. A lot of the parents can’t afford food, water, education, or healthcare, so they are often left with no choice but to send their children to work for an additional source of income.[8]\n\n IKEA and Child Labor Accusations\nThe accusations of child labor in the rug industry in Pakistan posed a serious challenge for IKEA and its supply chain management goals. It would need to address the serious issues of alleged injustice for the sake of its reputation and brand image. Additionally, as IKEA also had suppliers in India, it would need to be in compliance with India’s “landmark legislation act against child labor, the Child Labor (Prohibition and Regulation) Act of 1986.”[9]\n\nAs a result of these accusations, IKEA ultimately ended its contracts with Pakistani rug manufacturers, but the problem of child labor in its supply chain still persisted in other countries that were supplying IKEA.

If Drake meets with Alex, he will be able to provide specific advice that will ensure Alex’s proposal is approved, and that seems unfair to other student groups. Drake wishes he could offer personalized guidance to every student organization, but far too many proposals are submitted each quarter to meet with each group individually. If Drake chooses not to review the funding request, he knows Alex will be upset. After all, Alex has already put in the work to craft the full proposal.

However, the building is currently not occupied by any tenants, as the pandemic has lowered the demand for office spaces. The building has five shareholders, including Mary, her older brother Donald (who is the president of the family business), her older sister Sally (who is the secretary), and her two cousins. The building is valued at 10 million dollars, and the shareholders have complete ownership of the business, with no debt to pay off. Although all shareholders are minority stakeholders, Mary’s brother has the highest percentage of ownership, equal to 26%. Mary and Sally own just over 25%, and the two cousins, together, own about 23%. \n\nRecently, Donald has said that he wants to be done with the complexities and legalities of the business, and has asked to be bought out. His expectation is to be paid the full percentage of ownership times the fair market value for his share, putting his expectation at over 2.5 million dollars, since, he argues, “family” wouldn’t give anyone less than their full share. \n\nHowever, Mary knows that that’s just not the way that the business marketplace works. It is a well enshrined principle that a minority shareholding cannot expect to receive a buyout amounting to a proportionate valuation of the entire issued share capital (shares gain in value to the extent they also reflect voting power within a company; a minority shareholder has less voting power and thus less valuable shares). When you have a minority interest in a business, you’re going to be bought out at a discount, and it is not unusual for that discount to be up to 30%. Donald will not accept such a discount and remains firm in his belief that as a family member, he should be bought out in full. \n\nSince no one is likely to buy out Donald’s share in the business, Mary and others agree that the only way to satisfy her brother’s wishes is to sell the building. Donald believes that this is the best option, as their children have no interest in continuing the family business. Mary’s two children, Sally’s three, and Donald’s two are all self-sufficient. Donald argues that they should just rip the bandaid off and sell the building to avoid passing on the responsibilities and burdens of the business to their children. \n\nHowever, Mary recognizes that selling the building has significant tax implications. After taking inflation into account, Mary believes that they would be lucky to sell the building for 4 million dollars.

Given the tremendous tax burden, Mary believes that selling the business would not be worth it for anyone involved.  \n\nMary reminisces about how she utilized the solid monthly income generated by the building’s tenants a few years ago to support her children and send them to college. She is reluctant to give up the business and lose a substantial amount towards taxes, simply because the building has no current tenants. Mary also believes that hiring people to manage the business is a viable solution. \n\nHowever, Mary is aware that her brother does not share the same viewpoint and is reluctant to use his own savings to hire external individuals to run the business. He deems it too risky and not worthwhile, particularly since all their children are well-employed and uninterested in handling the business any further. \n\nDue to the significant difference in opinion regarding the fate of the building, it may ultimately come down to a vote.

Dave’s project there involved building houses for the poor. He was part of a team that would offer people in poor communities zero interest loans funded with donor money. In turn, the recipients of the funds would build a house (using the funds for labor and construction materials). Then the recipients would owe a mortgage and in turn their payment of the mortgage would go into a revolving fund that allowed the organization to make additional loans and thus build more houses.\n\nAs part of a United States-based international organization, Dave and his team worked with a non-profit in the DR in order to have local help administering the project. Not only did the local non-profit help with the management and administration of the project, but it also had a bank account in which Dave could exchange his donor money (which was in U.S. dollars) for Dominican pesos that would then allow the recipients of the loans to purchase the labor and building materials locally. \n\nDave got to know the guys at the non-profit in the DR, and he knew that they were pretty entrepreneurial in figuring out how to attract donor and aid money.

Moreover, the exchange rate was set by the government at four pesos per U.S. dollar. It was illegal to buy and sell currencies outside of official banks and windows.

The managers didn’t hide what they were doing. Plus he liked them and knew about their lives and their struggles. He knew they were only making about 8,000 pesos per year and it was barely enough for them and their families to get by. And he wondered what they were doing with all that excess money. \n\nBut Dave also knew that if they were getting such a good exchange rate on the black market and pocketing the money, he also could go to the black market in order to raise even more money to help the poor build houses.

In her 4th and final year, she will apply to residency programs in several states. Given her stellar record, you expect Julia to be competitive for top nationally-ranked hospital residency programs.

Sophie protests that her longstanding physician in her home-town retired recently and she doesn’t have any personal doctor, let alone one she knows and trusts. You offer to refer her to a colleague in community practice, but she begs to talk to you, because she fears her health problem could affect her professional future and feels you would best understand that. You agree to make an exception and accept her as a patient for the short remainder of her time in medical school, and ask your office staff to work her into your clinic schedule promptly. You ask Sophie for access to her medical records, which are unremarkable. \n\nAt her clinic visit, you find Sophie has lost some weight from her previous healthy weight. Sophie tells you that she is suffering from symptoms that she believes are serious depression: generalized sadness, loss of appetite, and lethargy. She confesses that she is struggling to get up in the morning and come to the hospital to meet her responsibilities as a medical student. She isn’t aware of any trigger or cause; she just thinks the heavy schedule and emotional weight of third-year training is “getting to her.” She tells you she had approximately year-long spells of depression that “felt like this” twice before, once in high school and once in college. In both cases, her family physician prescribed an antidepressant, but at her request recorded the reason as menstrual irregularities, so she would never have to report a history of depression. (Relief of certain menstrual symptoms is a common off-label use of anti-depressants. Sophie reports that she does have some mild menstrual irregularities, such as uneven cycles and moderate PMS, that have incidentally improved when on the antidepressant.) She felt the anti- depressant helped greatly in her past episodes of depression, and that she was able to wean off easily after an adequate period of stability. \n\nSophie asks you to do the same, prescribing antidepressants without acknowledging depression as the reason. Since her training in medical school has emphasized the desirability of combining pharmacological treatment with therapy for many kinds of depression, she notes she is also willing to try therapy, too, for the first time in her life, and to consider your recommendations for therapists. However, she asks that you not put that referral in her medical record. She says she will find a way to pay for therapy out-of-pocket rather than seeking insurance reimbursement, which would create a record of the depression. She says she hates to ask you these two favors “because the world shouldn’t be this way,” but she believes “you know how it really is.” Sophie will need to apply for medical licensure in whatever state she pursues residency, and in whatever state she practices medicine after that.

It will also provide services such as wi-fi hotspots, electric vehicle charging facilities, information dashboard for maps and directions, real-time traffic updates, and car parking vacancy space information.\n\nSmart lampposts are often adopted as a means to reduce energy use, as well as to enhance public safety. A number of cities in the U.S., too, have deployed versions that include microphones and related AI technology; Los Angeles, for example, is reportedly “equipping the streetlights with sensors that can detect gunshots or other noises that may pose a threat to public safety.” Schenectady, N.Y., has installed environmentally friendly LED bulbs in 5,000 of its streetlights, with “the entire network accessible through a secure web browser.” When there are no cars or people on the streets served by smart light posts, the smart lights dim; if motion sensors are triggered, the lights go up. In 2017, the mayor of Schenectady explained: “So, if you’re walking a dog at 10 p.m. at night and all the lights are going on in the street when you’re walking down, you get an added level of security.”\n\nIn Singapore, a Smart Nation Sensor Platform project got underway in 2018, aiming to eventually fit all 100,000 of that city’s light posts with a network of smart sensors. Responding to concerns raised about privacy—in particular by the proposed use of facial recognition technology in combination with the deployment of high-definition camera on the light poles—the Deputy Secretary of the program commented,\n\nWe have no plans to use it to probe into how people live their lives. … The whole point of the sensor platform is to look at improving services, look at how to run the city and operate the city better and how to plan the city better. We have no plans to do moral policing or things like that.\n\nAt least one local professor noted, however, that cybersecurity and data leaks could be “bigger dangers.”\n\nPrivacy concerns were also expressed by a councilman in San Jose, California, when in 2018 the city approved the installation of 1,000 smart streetlights which can also, purportedly, “[detect] car crashes, gun shots and even [serve] as an earthquake sensor.” According to a report on the local NBC station, the streetlights are also equipped with “face recognition, cameras, and audio recording capabilities.” While some raised concerns, one resident quoted in the news report argued that \"If people know they're being watched, they don't do stupid things.”\n\nBack in Hong Kong, the rollout of the smart lampposts program began in July 2019. The following month, during mass protests, various news outlets reported that some demonstrators, worried about governmental surveillance, were cutting down the newly installed smart lampposts. According to an article in The Atlantic,\n\nThe Hong Kong government has acknowledged that the lampposts have enough hardware to spy on citizens, but says protesters’ fears are unfounded. In July, as the first wave of lampposts were installed around the region, federal officials promised to disable some surveillance features, including license-plate recognition and continuous audiovisual surveillance. Tony Wong, an assistant government chief information officer in Hong Kong, said in a recent press conference that the posts aren’t capable of the invasive facial recognition deployed in China.\n\nThe Hong Kong Free Press noted that, after 20 smart lampposts were destroyed, a local company involved in the project decided to end its contract with the Hong Kong government. The company reported that some of its employees, as well as family members of some of its executives, had received threats.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nThe Colorado River provides water for 40 million people in seven states: Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, California, Arizona, and Nevada. The river starts as a small stream in Colorado’s Rocky Mountains and flows south and west for 1,450 miles until it ends in Mexico’s Gulf of California [1]. The Colorado River has reached an all-time low level of water due to a combination of chronic overuse of water resources and a historic drought exacerbated by climate change [1]. Because of the multi-state nature of this issue, water rights based on seniority have been agreed on between the seven states to determine how much water is allocated to each state. However, there is much debate between the states today over the validity of the rights that were determined in the mid-1900s when faced with the current climate crisis-induced droughts. Furthermore, the water rights of Indigenous groups around the Colorado River have been largely ignored historically and currently in negotiations for water allocations. This paper will explore how the drying up of the Colorado River is impacting states that rely on its water resources with a specific focus on the environmental justice issues for the Navajo tribe in Arizona. \n\nThe Colorado River is a crucial source of water for Western states and is being heavily impacted by climate change creating a tense situation between the states that rely on the river to sustain themselves. Hotter and drier conditions in the United States have drained the two major reservoirs on the river to incredibly low levels that have not been seen since these reservoirs were first filled [1]. These two man-made reservoirs are Lake Powell on the Arizona-Utah border and Lake Mead on the Arizona-Nevada border [1]. The Lower Basin states (California, Arizona, and Nevada) rely on water from these reservoirs, while the Upper Basin states (Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, and New Mexico) have fewer reservoirs and divert water directly from the river in thousands of places [1]. If the water level in the two main reservoirs falls too low they could reach “dead pool”; a scenario where there is not enough water in the reservoirs to pass through the dams [2]. The Lower Basin states would lose their main source of drinking water, their main source of irrigation, and the hydropower that is created by the dams [2]. Because climate change has impacted the river so greatly, states that rely on its water are rushing to secure their rights to the water supply and ensure adequate water for their residents. \n\nA major factor in determining water allocation from the river for each state is the notion of water rights. Water rights refer to who has permission to take water out of the Colorado River. The rights are based on seniority and are governed through a complicated network of laws, court decisions, contracts, and regulations known as the Law of the River [1]. Therefore, because California claimed water rights first, they have more water allocated to them. In 1922, the seven states signed the Colorado River Compact to determine how the water would be distributed [1]. In 1994, Mexico was guaranteed a portion of the river by this treaty, so a total of 17.5 million acre-feet of water were shared between the states and Mexico [1]. In the 1963 Supreme court case, Arizona v. California, it was decided that of the first 7.5 million acre-feet that head to the Lower Basin states, 4.4 million goes to CA, 2.8 million goes to AZ, and 300,000 acre-feet go to Nevada [1]. In 1968 the Federal government agreed to build a network of canals that transport Colorado River water through Arizona known as the Central Arizona Project. The project serves 6 million people– more than 80% of the state’s population [3]. In exchange for the creation of this project, Arizona agreed to junior water rights meaning California would get its share of water before Arizona in times of shortage [1]. Water rights are being used as the main element of debate in determining the allocation of a diminishing Colorado River. \n\nThe Biden administration is pushing the states to reach an agreement that will allow them to cut 2 to 4 million acre-feet in usage and keep the reservoirs from hitting dead pool [1]. California uses more water than any of the states and is the remaining holdout among the seven states in current negotiations [1]. The other six states have signed on to an agreement to make these cuts, but California is proposing its own plan that would put a massive burden on Arizona [1]. California’s plan states that when the reservoirs reach their lowest levels, there will be a cut of nearly 1 million additional acre-feet for Arizona leaving the state with only 600,000 acre-feet despite the state’s allotment of 2.8 million acre-feet [1]. This has created a debate between Arizona and California over who should have to be the first to cut water usage and by what quantity. This debate has slowed progress of the seven states reaching an agreement of water cuts. Arizona and California already use the most water but are petitioning for the other five states to cut their water usage first. The southern part of California, mainly farmers in San Diego and the Imperial Valley, receives water from the CO River. California argues that it has senior rights so Arizona should cut water first, and because they produce so many vegetables and feed for livestock, meaningful cuts would cause a food crisis perhaps affecting a large part of the country [2]. Arizona argues that while the CO River Compact may say Arizona should cut usage first, it does not make sense with the situation the state is facing with climate change and would be causing significant health harms to cities. Furthermore, water cuts would harm Indigenous tribes in Arizona who already receive little water and the government would be violating its obligations to the tribes that have been promised water through treaties. The lack of water from the Colorado River is causing major debate between the states that rely on it to survive with California and Arizona, the river’s biggest users, having the most disagreement. \n\nAmidst all of the negotiations and debate between state legislators over water rights, one group has been excluded from the conversation– Indigenous people. Specifically important to Arizona’s water negotiations is the Navajo tribe whose reservation, the Navajo Nation, is the largest Native American reservation in the United States and comprises 16 million acres in the Four Corners area [4]. Despite their size and history in Arizona, members of the Navajo Nation lack the easy access to running water that Arizonans who are not Native American take for granted. Thirty percent of Navajo Nation citizens have no running water and Navajo people use 8-10 gallons of water a day, which is about 1/10 of what the average American uses [5]. Historically, the Navajo people have faced systemic injustices which have resulted in inadequate infrastructure and limited economic opportunities which exacerbate their water access problem. The drying up of the Colorado River further compounds this issue for the Navajo tribe. These injustices are a clear environmental justice case. The Nation claims that the federal government has a duty to address the tribe’s water rights and a Supreme Court case argued the matter in March, 2023. The Navajo Nation stated that an 1868 treaty promised sufficient land and water for the Navajos to return to a permanent home in their ancestral territory, but the government has not lived up to that treaty [6]. The tribe was not seeking a decision on rights to the Lower Colorado River specifically, but the tribe’s lawyers said that the federal government’s oversight of the entire Colorado River as well as its duties to the tribe required it to do a full assessment of the Navajo Nation’s water rights, which may impact how Colorado River water is allocated [7]. In June, 2023, the Supreme Court reached a decision in the case, denying the Navajo Nation access to Colorado River water [8]. Despite treaties that the Navajo Nation believed protected their water rights, the tribe remains without adequate access to water. While the Supreme Court might find no legal obligation to the Navajo Nation, for the sake of human rights and justice above mere US law, actions should be taken to implement safe and reliable water sources for all members of the Navajo Nation. \n\nThis case of the lack of water access for the Navajo Nation amidst the Colorado River crisis is an example of environmental injustice.

The river starts as a small stream in Colorado’s Rocky Mountains and flows south and west for 1,450 miles until it ends in Mexico’s Gulf of California [1]. The Colorado River has reached an all-time low level of water due to a combination of chronic overuse of water resources and a historic drought exacerbated by climate change [1]. Because of the multi-state nature of this issue, water rights based on seniority have been agreed on between the seven states to determine how much water is allocated to each state. However, there is much debate between the states today over the validity of the rights that were determined in the mid-1900s when faced with the current climate crisis-induced droughts. Furthermore, the water rights of Indigenous groups around the Colorado River have been largely ignored historically and currently in negotiations for water allocations. This paper will explore how the drying up of the Colorado River is impacting states that rely on its water resources with a specific focus on the environmental justice issues for the Navajo tribe in Arizona. \n\nThe Colorado River is a crucial source of water for Western states and is being heavily impacted by climate change creating a tense situation between the states that rely on the river to sustain themselves. Hotter and drier conditions in the United States have drained the two major reservoirs on the river to incredibly low levels that have not been seen since these reservoirs were first filled [1]. These two man-made reservoirs are Lake Powell on the Arizona-Utah border and Lake Mead on the Arizona-Nevada border [1]. The Lower Basin states (California, Arizona, and Nevada) rely on water from these reservoirs, while the Upper Basin states (Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, and New Mexico) have fewer reservoirs and divert water directly from the river in thousands of places [1]. If the water level in the two main reservoirs falls too low they could reach “dead pool”; a scenario where there is not enough water in the reservoirs to pass through the dams [2]. The Lower Basin states would lose their main source of drinking water, their main source of irrigation, and the hydropower that is created by the dams [2]. Because climate change has impacted the river so greatly, states that rely on its water are rushing to secure their rights to the water supply and ensure adequate water for their residents. \n\nA major factor in determining water allocation from the river for each state is the notion of water rights. Water rights refer to who has permission to take water out of the Colorado River. The rights are based on seniority and are governed through a complicated network of laws, court decisions, contracts, and regulations known as the Law of the River [1]. Therefore, because California claimed water rights first, they have more water allocated to them. In 1922, the seven states signed the Colorado River Compact to determine how the water would be distributed [1]. In 1994, Mexico was guaranteed a portion of the river by this treaty, so a total of 17.5 million acre-feet of water were shared between the states and Mexico [1]. In the 1963 Supreme court case, Arizona v. California, it was decided that of the first 7.5 million acre-feet that head to the Lower Basin states, 4.4 million goes to CA, 2.8 million goes to AZ, and 300,000 acre-feet go to Nevada [1]. In 1968 the Federal government agreed to build a network of canals that transport Colorado River water through Arizona known as the Central Arizona Project. The project serves 6 million people– more than 80% of the state’s population [3]. In exchange for the creation of this project, Arizona agreed to junior water rights meaning California would get its share of water before Arizona in times of shortage [1]. Water rights are being used as the main element of debate in determining the allocation of a diminishing Colorado River. \n\nThe Biden administration is pushing the states to reach an agreement that will allow them to cut 2 to 4 million acre-feet in usage and keep the reservoirs from hitting dead pool [1]. California uses more water than any of the states and is the remaining holdout among the seven states in current negotiations [1]. The other six states have signed on to an agreement to make these cuts, but California is proposing its own plan that would put a massive burden on Arizona [1]. California’s plan states that when the reservoirs reach their lowest levels, there will be a cut of nearly 1 million additional acre-feet for Arizona leaving the state with only 600,000 acre-feet despite the state’s allotment of 2.8 million acre-feet [1]. This has created a debate between Arizona and California over who should have to be the first to cut water usage and by what quantity. This debate has slowed progress of the seven states reaching an agreement of water cuts. Arizona and California already use the most water but are petitioning for the other five states to cut their water usage first. The southern part of California, mainly farmers in San Diego and the Imperial Valley, receives water from the CO River. California argues that it has senior rights so Arizona should cut water first, and because they produce so many vegetables and feed for livestock, meaningful cuts would cause a food crisis perhaps affecting a large part of the country [2]. Arizona argues that while the CO River Compact may say Arizona should cut usage first, it does not make sense with the situation the state is facing with climate change and would be causing significant health harms to cities. Furthermore, water cuts would harm Indigenous tribes in Arizona who already receive little water and the government would be violating its obligations to the tribes that have been promised water through treaties. The lack of water from the Colorado River is causing major debate between the states that rely on it to survive with California and Arizona, the river’s biggest users, having the most disagreement. \n\nAmidst all of the negotiations and debate between state legislators over water rights, one group has been excluded from the conversation– Indigenous people. Specifically important to Arizona’s water negotiations is the Navajo tribe whose reservation, the Navajo Nation, is the largest Native American reservation in the United States and comprises 16 million acres in the Four Corners area [4]. Despite their size and history in Arizona, members of the Navajo Nation lack the easy access to running water that Arizonans who are not Native American take for granted. Thirty percent of Navajo Nation citizens have no running water and Navajo people use 8-10 gallons of water a day, which is about 1/10 of what the average American uses [5]. Historically, the Navajo people have faced systemic injustices which have resulted in inadequate infrastructure and limited economic opportunities which exacerbate their water access problem. The drying up of the Colorado River further compounds this issue for the Navajo tribe. These injustices are a clear environmental justice case. The Nation claims that the federal government has a duty to address the tribe’s water rights and a Supreme Court case argued the matter in March, 2023. The Navajo Nation stated that an 1868 treaty promised sufficient land and water for the Navajos to return to a permanent home in their ancestral territory, but the government has not lived up to that treaty [6]. The tribe was not seeking a decision on rights to the Lower Colorado River specifically, but the tribe’s lawyers said that the federal government’s oversight of the entire Colorado River as well as its duties to the tribe required it to do a full assessment of the Navajo Nation’s water rights, which may impact how Colorado River water is allocated [7]. In June, 2023, the Supreme Court reached a decision in the case, denying the Navajo Nation access to Colorado River water [8]. Despite treaties that the Navajo Nation believed protected their water rights, the tribe remains without adequate access to water. While the Supreme Court might find no legal obligation to the Navajo Nation, for the sake of human rights and justice above mere US law, actions should be taken to implement safe and reliable water sources for all members of the Navajo Nation. \n\nThis case of the lack of water access for the Navajo Nation amidst the Colorado River crisis is an example of environmental injustice.

Many people living in the Navajo Nation do not have access to water now, so they should be included in the allocation negotiations to make sure they gain access even as the river loses more water. Ensuring the participation of the Navajo Nation in water allocation decision-making processes is essential to address these injustices and achieve equitable solutions. \n\nThe Colorado River is an integral source of life for millions of people but climate change has led to a sharp decline in water resources. The states that rely on the river for water must now reach an agreement of how to cut their water usage. Amidst these negotiations, the voices of the Navajo tribe should be lifted up to ensure that the Navajo Nation, which has historically experienced environmental injustices related to water accessibility, receives its proper allotment of water.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this scenario, I would take the following specific actions:\n\n1. Reach out to relevant stakeholders and policymakers to advocate for the inclusion of the Navajo Nation in the negotiations and decision-making processes regarding water allocation from the Colorado River.

Facebook doesn’t have any clear policies permitting preemptive distribution moderation if a post is simply eligible to be fact-checked. And aren’t all posts eligible for fact-checking? And apparently, Twitter doesn’t have any third-party fact-checking partnerships at all, at least according to the editor-in-chief of PolitiFact who voiced her concerns over social media. “Has Twitter partnered with fact-checkers without telling anyone? It would be news to me.” (Poynter). \n\nBut despite both companies’ efforts to limit its spread, the Post article attracted significant attention. Axios reported that the NY Post article received 2.59 million interactions on Facebook and Twitter during the week of its publication (83% on Facebook and 17% on Twitter). On October 20th, it became the 6th most popular news article of the month (Axios).\n\nUsing the words historic and unprecedented to describe the circumstances of the 2020 presidential election has become somewhat cliché. The sheer number of potentially false news stories exchanged online is only one of the factors informing this cliché. Although they may not have said so publicly, Facebook and Twitter’s decisions reflect the unique election-time pressure afflicting the entire journalistic and social media enterprise.
