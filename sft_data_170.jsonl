Key to Abramoff’s conviction were his lobbying efforts that began in the 1990s on behalf of Native American tribes seeking to establish gambling on reservations.\n\nIn 1996, Abramoff began working for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. With the help of Republican tax reform advocate Grover Norquist, and his political advocacy group Americans for Tax Reform, Abramoff defeated a Congressional bill that would have taxed Native American casinos. Texas Representative and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay also played a major role in the bill’s defeat. DeLay pushed the agenda of Abramoff’s lobbying clients in exchange for favors from Abramoff.\n\nIn 1999, Abramoff similarly lobbied to defeat a bill in the Alabama State Legislature that would have allowed casino-style games on dog racing tracks. This bill would have created competition for his clients’ casino businesses. Republican political activist Ralph Reed, and his political consulting firm Century Strategies, aided the effort by leading a grassroots campaign that rallied Alabama-based Christian organizations to oppose the bill.\n\nAs Abramoff’s successes grew, his clients, political contacts, and influence expanded. He hired aides and former staff of members of Congress. In 2001, Abramoff began working with Congressman DeLay’s former communications director, Michael Scanlon, who had formed his own public affairs consulting firm, Capitol Campaign Strategies. The Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana hired Abramoff and Capitol Campaign Strategies to help them renegotiate their gambling agreement with the State of Louisiana. Abramoff, however, did not disclose to the tribe that, in addition to his own consulting fees, he also received a portion of the fees paid to Scanlon’s firm.\n\nIn an effort to protect his Coushatta clients in Louisiana from competition by a new casino near Houston, Texas, Abramoff successfully lobbied for a state gambling ban in Texas between 2001 and 2002. Incidental to this ban was the closure of a casino in El Paso, Texas, owned by the Tigua Tribal Nation. The Tigua were another one of Abramoff’s casino clients.\n\nLater in 2002, Abramoff made a pitch to the Tigua to work to oppose the ban for which he had previously lobbied successfully. With the Tigua’s money, Abramoff took Ohio Representative Bob Ney and his staff on a golfing trip to Scotland. Abramoff hoped to convince Ney and his colleagues to slip a provision into an election-reform bill that would grant the Tigua gaming rights. Abramoff’s efforts did not pay off, and the deal he sought fell through, but he did not inform the Tigua of this outcome. Rather, Abramoff continued to give the Tigua hope for the provision’s success, while also continuing to charge them for his and Scanlon’s services. And, in their email exchanges, Abramoff and Scanlon often mocked their tribal clients as “morons” and “monkeys.”\n\nThroughout the course of their work with Native American tribes, Abramoff and Scanlon charged upwards of $66 million. The Coushatta paid over $30 million to protect their casino and to stop competing casinos in Texas. The Tigua paid $4.2 million to try to continue operating their casino in Texas. Abramoff has stated that he donated much of the money he made to charities, schools, and causes he believed in. But he also spent millions of dollars on activities or contributions in connection with politicians and campaigns he sought to influence. Furthermore, he evaded taxes by funneling money through nonprofit organizations with which he partnered.\n\nAfter his conviction in 2006, Abramoff cooperated in the investigation of his relationships with Congress members, including aides, business associates, government officials, and lawmakers. Representatives DeLay and Ney both stepped down from their positions in Congress. DeLay, who had risen to the rank of House Majority Leader, was charged with money laundering and conspiracy of funneling corporate contributions to state candidates. Ney plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and making false statements. In exchange for gifts, lavish trips, and political donations from Abramoff, DeLay and Ney had used their positions in Congress to grant favors to Abramoff’s clients and lobbying team. Abramoff served three and a half years of a six-year prison term. He was released on December 3, 2010.\n\nSince his release, Abramoff has spoken out against corruption in politics. He has stated that he believed himself to be a “moral lobbyist” and has apologized for his actions. In a 2011 interview, he said, “What’s legal in this system is the problem,” and in his memoir, he wrote, “Unfortunately, I was a miniature version of that system.” But not everyone perceived his redemption as a genuine effort. Tigua tribal leaders said his apologies were too little, too late. Rick Hill, former chairman of the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, stated, “You look at Jack—though he took money from my elders and our kids, and now he comes here, and he gets to prop himself up, and it’s an acceptable part of [Washington] D.C. culture. He wouldn’t stand a minute on the reservation.”\n\nOthers point to the American political system, and see Abramoff as a symptom of broader corruption. Investigative journalist Susan Schmidt stated, “Abramoff couldn’t have flourished if this system, itself, was not corrupt, where the need for money—the members of Congress and their need for money—is so voracious and so huge that they don’t have their guard up.” California Representative Dana Rohrabacher said, “What Jack had been doing was what had been done before. People should pay more attention to the fact that we have got some enormous special interests in this country who are having incredible influences on policy.”\n\nIn his memoir, Abramoff reflected on personal and professional reform: “Regardless of my rationalizations, I was the one who didn’t disclose to my clients that there was a conflict of interest… I wasn’t the devil that the media were so quick to create, but neither was I the saint I always hoped to become. …I decided that, in order to move myself close to the angels, I would take what happened in my life, try to learn from it, and use it to educate others.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would conduct a thorough review of my own lobbying activities and client relationships to ensure full transparency and disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest.

During the 2014 holiday season, 74.5 million iPhones were sold. Demand like this meant that Apple was in line to make over $52 billion in profits in 2015, the largest annual profit ever generated from a company’s operations. Despite its consistent financial performance year over year, Apple’s robust profit margin hides a more complicated set of business ethics. Similar to many products sold in the U.S., Apple does not manufacture most of its goods domestically. Most of the component sourcing and factory production is done overseas in conditions that critics have argued are dangerous to workers and harmful to the environment.\n\nFor example, tin is a major component in Apple’s products and much of it is sourced in Indonesia. Although there are mines that source tin ethically, there are also many that do not. One study found workers—many of them children—working in unsafe conditions, digging tin out by hand in mines prone to landslides that could bury workers alive. About 70% of the tin used in electronic devices such as smartphones and tablets comes from these more dangerous, small-scale mines. An investigation by the BBC revealed how perilous these working conditions can be. In interviews with miners, a 12-year-old working at the bottom of a 70-foot cliff of sand said: “I worry about landslides. The earth slipping from up there to the bottom. It could happen.”\n\nApple defends its practices by saying it only has so much control over monitoring and regulating its component sources. The company justifies its sourcing practices by saying that it is a complex process, with tens of thousands of miners selling tin, many of them through middle-men. In a statement to the BBC, Apple said “the simplest course of action would be for Apple to unilaterally refuse any tin from Indonesian mines. That would be easy for us to do and would certainly shield us from criticism. But that would also be the lazy and cowardly path, since it would do nothing to improve the situation. We have chosen to stay engaged and attempt to drive changes on the ground.”\n\nIn an effort for greater transparency, Apple has released annual reports detailing their work with suppliers and labor practices.

Roosevelt believed he served the people, not just the government. He took many actions as president that stretched the limits of the executive branch, including the creation of national parks without regard for states’ jurisdiction and fostering revolt in Colombia to establish the Panama Canal.\n\nOn the other hand, William Howard Taft, President of the United States from 1909-1913, embodied what many scholars refer to as a ‘strict constructionist’ model of the presidency. Under this approach, unless the Constitution or Congress explicitly grants a certain power, the president does not have the right to act. In Taft’s words, “the President can exercise no power which cannot be fairly and reasonably traced to some specific grant of power or justly implied and included within such express grant as proper and necessary to its exercise.”\n\nWhile Roosevelt expanded federal power in many areas, Taft felt many of these actions were legal overreaches. For example, as a “trust-buster” Roosevelt differentiated between ‘good’ trusts and ‘bad’ trusts, using his expanded powers as president to make this distinction unilaterally. He made a ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ with U.S. Steel and told them that the American government would not attack their corporation as a monopoly since he believed the company was working in the interests of the American people. Roosevelt did not, however, pass any legislation or make any binding orders to this effect. Taft took a more legalistic view and later, as president, directed his attorney general to file an anti-trust lawsuit against U.S. Steel. Roosevelt took Taft’s actions as a personal attack upon Roosevelt’s presidency and positions.\n\nAlthough Taft continued many of Roosevelt’s policies, he was inclined to look at the facts of the situation and make a choice based on evidence.

Andy Warhol, for example, is well known for appropriating images of Campbell’s soup cans for his pop art. Typically, the original object or image remains recognizable, but the new work of art transforms or recontextualizes the borrowed image or object in order to generate new meaning. Many artists believe that without artistic appropriation, creating new art would not be possible. On the other hand, the line between copyright infringement and fair use is not always clear.\n\nIn 2008, Shepard Fairey appropriated an Associated Press (A.P.) photo of Barack Obama to create his well-known “Hope” image of the presidential candidate. In 2009, Fairey filed a preemptive lawsuit against The A.P., requesting that the court declare protection from any copyright infringement claims on the basis of fair use. Fair use is the copying of copyrighted material for limited “transformative” purposes, such as criticism, parody, or commentary. Fairey acknowledged that his image was based on a 2006 photograph taken by A.P. photographer Mannie Garcia. The A.P. claimed that any use of the photo required permission and asked for credit and compensation.\n\nAnthony T. Falzone, executive director of the Fair Use Project and one of Fairey’s lawyers, said that Fairey only used the original image as a reference and transformed it into a “stunning, abstracted and idealized visual image that created powerful new meaning and conveys a radically different message.” Paul Colford, spokesman for The A.P., said, “[The A.P. was] disappointed by the surprise filing by Shepard Fairey and his company and by Mr. Fairey’s failure to recognize the rights of photographers in their works.” Mannie Garcia argued that he actually owned the copyright to the photo, not The A.P., according to his contract at the time. He stated, “I don’t condone people taking things, just because they can… But in this case I think it’s a very unique situation… If you put all the legal stuff away, I’m so proud of the photograph and that Fairey did what he did artistically with it, and the effect it’s had.”\n\nAfter two years in court, Shepard Fairey and The A.P. settled the case with an undisclosed financial agreement.

In August 2015, President Obama authorized Royal Dutch Shell to expand drilling off Alaska’s northwest coast. His decision brought into sharp relief the different, oftentimes competing views on the expansion of offshore drilling.\n\nMany proponents of offshore drilling argue that tapping into the vast amount of oil and gas reserves in the Arctic will help shore up national security interests for the United States, bolster its economy and workforce, and offer Americans a reliable, safe supply of oil. According to Robert Bryce, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, there are “enormous amounts of recoverable energy resources in the Arctic. The Department of Energy estimates them at something on the order of 400 billion barrels of oil equivalent in natural gas and oil. That’s four times the crude oil reserves of Kuwait.” Framed this way, drilling in the Arctic presents a way for Americans to mitigate risks from dependence on foreign oil and build the local and national economies by creating jobs and supplying cheap oil.\n\nA competing point of view charges that offshore oil drilling poses immense risk to the environment while reinforcing a reliance on dirty, environmentally unfriendly sources of energy. Critics claim that industrial activity associated with offshore drilling in the Arctic could harm native animals, including polar bears, walruses, seals, and whales already jeopardized by climate warming and declining levels of sea ice. Environmentalists argue that oil companies have not demonstrated the capability to clean up an oil spill in water obstructed by ice. Furthermore, they contend, extracting oil only perpetuates a fossil-fuel economy and will contribute dangerously to rising global temperature thereby exacerbating climate change.\n\n“Granting Shell the permit to drill in the Arctic was the wrong decision, and this fight is far from over,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. “The people will continue to call on President Obama to protect the Arctic and our environment.” "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would conduct a thorough environmental impact assessment of the proposed offshore drilling expansion in Alaska's northwest coast.

While this law applied to all citizens and all forms of face covering, it became known as France’s “burka bill” because the rhetoric surrounding the bill targeted Muslim women who wore burkas—religious garments covering the face and body—in public.\n\nFrench lawmakers argued that the law was important for the separation of church and state and for the emancipation of women. Similar to the 2004 bill that outlawed the use of conspicuous religious symbols in public schools, including Muslim headscarves and Christian crosses, this law sought to further remove religious expression and iconography from public spaces in France. Some legislators argued that the burka was a harmful symbol of gender inequality that forced women to assume a subservient status to men in public. According to them, the law freed women from a discriminatory, patriarchal subculture.\n\nHowever, some in the French Muslim community saw the bill as an infringement of religious freedom and an act of cultural imperialism. They argued that French legislators were imposing their idea of gender equality onto their culture. Many of them, including some women, argued that wearing burkas actually emancipated women from the physical objectification so common in Western culture. A number of women protested the bill by dressing in burkas and going to the offices of lawmakers who supported the legislation. Other reports from individual women suggested that the law created a more hostile atmosphere for Islamic women in France.

He was particularly interested in the causes of Crohn’s disease, an inflammatory bowel disease. After a fellowship at the University of Toronto, Wakefield became a lab researcher at the Royal Free Hospital in London in 1988.\n\nWakefield developed a theory that the measles virus caused Crohn’s disease and formed an “Inflammatory Bowel Disease Study Group.” In May of 1995, the distraught mother of an autistic child phoned Wakefield and suggested that her son’s condition had been caused by the measles virus in the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. Of interest to Wakefield was the fact that the child also apparently suffered from symptoms consistent with inflammatory bowel disease, which the mother suspected were also caused by the MMR vaccine. Wakefield and his team began to study the mother’s hypothesis. From July 1996 to February 1997, the team solicited referral letters from doctors of children who appeared to have both autism and inflammatory bowel issues. Ultimately, the team studied twelve children.\n\nOn February 28, 1998, the “team” published an article in the prestigious medical journal, The Lancet. The article listed twelve co-authors but was actually solely written by Wakefield. It proposed a potential link between the MMR vaccine and a bowel-brain “syndrome” causing both “regressive autism” (where children lost abilities such as speech that they had once had) and Crohn’s disease. Even before publication of the article, Wakefield had told the press that the results of his research “clearly confirm our suspicions.” At a press conference following publication, Wakefield said: “I cannot support the continued use of the three vaccines given together. My concerns are that one more case of this is too many.” The article attracted much publicity and had a significant effect on the public’s views regarding vaccination. What was unknown at that time included:\n\n- On February 19, 1996, Wakefield had agreed to be a well-paid consultant to attorney Richard Barr who had been awarded a contract by the British Legal Aid Board to potentially file a class action lawsuit over the MMR vaccine.\n\n- Barr and Wakefield had developed a list of things that Wakefield’s research needed to show in order to be helpful to Barr’s lawsuit even before the study began.\n\n- Barr largely funded Wakefield’s research project using government funds allocated to the lawsuit.\n\n- Many of the twelve children in the study had ties to Barr or to anti-vaccine groups; they had gone to the hospital with their parents already intent upon suing the vaccine makers.\n\n- To gather information for the study, Wakefield and his team subjected the twelve children to endoscopies, a procedure that was “high risk,” even though many of the children had no medical need for the procedure. Wakefield did not disclose that his team did not have ethics committee approval to perform these risky, unnecessary procedures.\n\n- In June 1996, Wakefield filed patent applications for:\n\n  - A single measles vaccine\n\n  - A treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, and\n\n  - A treatment for autism\n\n- Members of Wakefield’s research team often spoke giddily of the Nobel Prize they would win and Wakefield himself aspired to be the greatest gastroenterologist ever.\n\nWakefield had previously formed companies (1991, 1993, 1994) to commercially exploit his scientific discoveries, but none had succeeded. Nonetheless, soon after publication of The Lancet article, Wakefield met with potential investors to form a company to sell products (e.g., an alternative measles vaccine) that he planned to develop in this area. His projections for revenue and profit potential were aggressively optimistic, depending largely on Barr’s litigation succeeding. He negotiated to give the school a piece of his projected action in return for certain benefits, including a title for himself as “professor.” The school refused to give Wakefield that title.\n\nIn October of 1998, Barr filed the first court claims. Wakefield was to be Barr’s primary expert witness and pretended to be an independent scientist. In 1999, when shortcomings in Wakefield’s study came to light (very small number of subjects, subjects not chosen randomly, no comparison group of non-autistic children, heavy reliance on parents’ memories and beliefs, etc.), his university asked him to replicate his research results with a “gold standard” scientific study. Wakefield readily agreed to do so, but never even began such a study. Ultimately, he refused additional replication requests.\n\nIn 2000, Wakefield testified in Washington D.C. before a congressional committee regarding the dangers of the MMR vaccine. Another witness was John O’Leary, an Irish pathologist. Neither disclosed that they were business partners nor that O’Leary was also being supported financially by lawyer Barr. By October 2003, the flaws in Wakefield’s study were sufficiently apparent that Barr’s MMR lawsuit was dismissed for lack of evidence. The government money stopped flowing, but Barr and his staff had already received $51m in current U.S. dollars and Wakefield had received $846,000 in today’s dollars, plus expenses (roughly eight times his medical school salary).\n\nSoon thereafter, journalist Brian Deer — whose book *The Doctor Who Fooled the World* provides virtually all the material for this case study — began thoroughly investigating Wakefield and his research. As litigation involving Wakefield and his colleagues proceeded, documents related to Wakefield’s study in The Lancet came to light, showing that the article inaccurately described the conditions of every single one of the twelve subjects. Some were described as having autism when medical records showed that they did not. Some were described as having Crohn’s disease, when medical records showed that they did not. Others were described as having developed autism soon after having received the MMR vaccine, while medical records showed that they had manifested signs of autism before being vaccinated. And so on.\n\nAlthough the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals clearly require that third-party funding and expert witness work must be disclosed as conflicts of interest, Wakefield said that he did not agree. On May 3, 2004, 10 of 12 co-authors on The Lancet article repudiated the paper’s conclusions. Ultimately, after a long hearing, the General Medical Council canceled Wakefield’s medical registration.\n\nNone of this prevented Wakefield from becoming the darling of the anti-vaccine set and creating significant vaccine hesitancy regarding the MMR vaccine (and others). The result has been a rise in measles deaths around the world. As of 2022, Wakefield maintains his discredited theory and paints himself as the victim in all this.

In an interview with GQ, he stated that he co-wrote “Blurred Lines.” But in court, he claimed that he was too high in the studio, and that Williams had in fact composed the song, and he had lied earlier in order to get credit. Williams claimed that, although Gaye’s music had influenced him in his youth, he did not copy Gaye’s song in his composition.\n\nIn March 2015, the jury ruled in favor of the Gaye estate, stating that while Williams and Thicke did not directly copy “Got to Give It Up,” there was enough of a similar “feel” to warrant copyright infringement. Gaye’s heirs were awarded $7.4 million in damages, the largest amount ever granted in a music copyright case.\n\nWhile many commentators agreed with this verdict, others were concerned that it could negatively affect songwriting within an entire genre. Musicologist Robert Fink, for example, stated that this verdict had the potential to set a precedent for “fencing off our shared heritage of sounds, grooves, vibes, tunes, and feels.” Musicians, artists, and writers often note that previous works influence them in their creative process, and that there is very little that is completely original. Thicke and Williams did not see the musical influence of Gaye as copyright infringement, but rather as inspiration that spurred them to create a new, original single.

In its modern Spanish style, bullfighting first became a prominent cultural event in the early 18th century. Yet despite its cultural significance, bullfighting continues to face increasing scrutiny in light of animal rights issues.\n\nSome people consider bullfighting a cruel sport in which the bull suffers a severe and tortuous death. Many animal rights activists often protest bullfighting in Spain and other countries, citing the needless endangerment of the bull and bullfighter. Some cities around the world where bullfighting was once popular, including Coslada (Spain), Mouans-Sartoux (France), and Teocelo (Mexico), have even declared themselves to be anti-bullfighting cities. Other places, including some towns in Catalonia (Spain), have ceased killing the bull in the fight, but continue bullfighting.\n\nTo other people, the spectacle of the bullfight is not mere sport. The event is not only culturally significant, but also a fine art in which the bullfighter is trained in a certain style and elicits emotion through the act of the fight. Writer Alexander Fiske-Harrison, in his research and training as a bullfighter, defends the practice and circumstances of the bull, “In terms of animal welfare, the fighting bull lives four to six years whereas the meat cow lives one to two. …Those years are spent free roaming…” And others similarly argue that the death of the bull in the ring is more humane than the death of animals in a slaughterhouse.

In the area of organic food alone, data from the Organic Trade Association reveals that consumer demand in the United States has seen double-digit growth every year since 1990. In 2014, the organic food market reached almost $40 billion in sales. Consumers of these products tend to be seen in a more positive light—they are deemed more ethical, more altruistic, and kinder than people who do not buy green products. But is there another side to this kind of consumer behavior?\n\nIn a series of experiments comparing consumption of green and “conventional” products, psychologists Nina Mazar and Chen-Bo Zhong demonstrated that those people who bought green products—like eco-friendly laundry detergent or organic yogurt—were less likely to share money with a stranger, more likely to cheat on a task in which they could earn money, and more likely to steal money when they thought they would not get caught. As the psychologists stated, “purchasing green products may license indulgence in self-interested and unethical behaviors.”\n\nMazar and Zhong, whose study received considerable media attention in their native Canada, as well as in American and British publications, said the results surprised them. Initially, they expected green products to provide a halo effect, whereby the positive impressions associated with green consumption would lead to positive outcomes in other areas. “Given that green products are manifestations of high ethical standards and humanitarian considerations, mere exposure [to them would] activate norms of social responsibility and ethical conduct,” said Mazar and Zhong in an interview.\n\nBut as the results indicate, the opposite can be true. “The message of this research is that actions which produce a sense of self content and moral glow can sometimes backfire,” Mazar stated in another interview.\n\nThese patterns have been shown to extend to other shopping scenarios. For example, one study tracked scanner data and shopper receipts at a California grocery store. Those shoppers who brought reusable grocery bags with them were more likely to buy environmentally friendly products, like organic food. But they were also more likely to buy indulgent products, like ice cream, cookies, candy, and cake. The researchers followed up this study with a series of experiments that showed these moral licensing effects only happened when the decision to bring the reusable bags was at the shopper’s discretion. When shoppers were told that the store required customers to use cloth bags, licensing effects disappeared and customers chose not to buy indulgent products.

The researchers argued that the use of human cadavers was necessary to study the actual effects of these crashes on the body. They insisted that the research would save lives because it would help engineers design safer cars.\n\nThere was significant public outcry against this practice from numerous groups. The ADAC, Germany’s largest automobile club, issued a statement challenging the research on ethical grounds:\n\n> “In an age when experiments on animals are being put into question, such tests must be carried out on dummies and not on children’s cadavers.”\n\nRudolph Hammerschmidt, spokesman for the Roman Catholic German Bishops’ Conference, similarly decried the practice, arguing:\n\n> “Even the dead possess human dignity…this research should be done with manikins.”\n\nPolitical leaders also weighed in on the debate.

His skills and judgment led him to be promoted, and he became the Cardinals’ scouting director in charge of the amateur draft.\n\nIn 2011, two of Correa’s colleagues, who were higher up in the Cardinal’s management, left the team to take top jobs with a rival team – the Houston Astros. Jeff Luhnow became the Astros’ general manager and Sig Mejdal took the job of director of decisions sciences. Correa now says that he was worried that these men might have taken important information, including data and algorithms that the Cardinals had spent a lot of time and money to develop, to the Astros. And he thought they might be using the information against the Cardinals.\n\nOne day, Correa guessed Mejdal’s password and used it to hack into the Astros’ webmail system. He accessed the Astros’ webmail at least 48 times (sometimes for as long as two hours at a time) over the next few years. He stole information, such as the Astros’ scouting reports, draft rankings, and trade discussions. Correa also took steps to cover up his actions. But eventually, he was discovered. In 2014, it appears that Correa leaked internal Astros’ trade talk notes to the prominent sports blog Deadspin, which caused the Astros to realize that their system had been compromised.\n\nThe FBI was called in. After some investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice charged Correa with five violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Correa pled guilty in early 2016 and was sentenced to 46 months in prison. He was ordered to pay the Astros $279,038 in restitution. Later, the Major League Baseball (MLB) Commissioner, Rob Manfred, imposed a lifetime ban on Correa from working in MLB. Manfred also fined the Cardinals $2 million, although there is no solid evidence that anyone other than Correa was involved in the hacking.\n\nAt his sentencing, Correa signed a document admitting that he had caused $1.7 million worth of losses to the Astros. However, whatever damage Correa did failed to prevent the Astros from being one of MLB’s best teams from (at least) 2016 to 2022.

The school was in a run-down neighborhood three miles south of downtown that was plagued by armed robberies. Lewis himself had grown up in a violent neighborhood. He empathized with his students and was devoted to their success. A colleague described Lewis as a “star teacher” and a “very hard worker, who will go the extra mile.”\n\nLewis was a teacher when Beverly Hall was Atlanta’s school superintendent. Hall believed that business approaches and the values of the market system could save public education. She set accountability measures for the Atlanta school district and created performance objectives that were tougher than those of No Child Left Behind, the federal program that became law in 2002. Teacher evaluations were linked to students’ performance on standardized tests. Schools whose students did not make appropriate progress toward the standardized test goals received escalating sanctions that culminated in replacement of the faculty and staff, and restructuring or closing of the school.\n\nParks Middle School was in dire straits because it had been classified as “a school in need of improvement” for the previous five years. Unless 58 percent of students passed the math portion of the standardized test and 67 percent passed the language arts portion, Parks Middle School could be closed down. Its students would be separated and bussed across town to different schools.\n\n“[It] was my sole obligation to never let that happen,” Lewis later told Rachel Aviv in an article about these events in The New Yorker. Lewis had pushed his students to work harder than they ever had in preparing for the test. But he knew that it would be very difficult for many of them to pass. Christopher Waller, the new principal of Parks, had heard that teachers in the elementary schools that fed into Parks had changed their students’ answers on the standardized tests under the guise of erasing stray pencil marks. Waller asked Lewis and other teachers to do the same. Lewis found the exams of students who needed to get a few more questions right in order to pass. He changed their answers. If he did not change their scores, Lewis feared that his students would lapse into “why try” attitudes. They would lose their neighborhood school and the community that had developed within it.\n\nThanks to Lewis and other teachers, Parks students did better than ever on the standardized tests. Neekisia Jackson, a former student at Parks at the time, recalled, “Everyone was jumping up and down,” after a teacher announced the school had met the goals of No Child Left Behind for the first time. Jackson continued, “We had heard what everyone was saying: ‘Y’all aren’t good enough.’ Now we could finally go to school with our heads held high.”\n\nThe same process of changing answers continued at Parks through 2010. By that time, nine other teachers were helping Lewis change answers.\n\nIn October of 2010, 50 agents of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation visited Parks and other Atlanta schools. The investigators concluded that teachers and administrators at 44 schools had cheated in the manner that Lewis had. In July of 2012, 110 teachers who had confessed or been accused of cheating were placed on administrative leave, including Lewis. Later that year, Lewis’ employment was terminated.\n\nThis case study is based on an article by Rachel Aviv entitled, “Wrong answer: In an era of high-stakes testing, a struggling school made a shocking choice,” that appeared in The New Yorker on July 21, 2014.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nIn baseball, catchers signal to pitchers which type of pitch to throw. Usually, catchers do this by holding down a certain number of fingers on their non-gloved hand between their legs as they crouch behind the plate. It is typically not as simple as just one finger for a fastball and two for a curve, but not a lot more complicated than that.\n\nIn September 2016, an intern for the Houston Astros major league baseball (MLB) team named Derek Vigoa showed Astros’ general manager Jeff Luhnow a PowerPoint presentation. It featured an Excel-based application programmed with an algorithm that could decode the pitching signs that opposing teams’ catchers flashed to their pitchers. The Astros called it “Codebreaker.” One organization employee referred to the sign-stealing system that evolved as the “dark arts.”\n\nMLB rules allowed a runner standing on second base to do what he could to steal signs and relay them to the batter. But MLB rules strictly forbade using electronic means to decipher and signal signs. The Astros “Codebreaker” violated these rules.\n\nAccording to Wall Street Journal writer Jared Diamond:\n\n> The way Codebreaker worked was simple: Somebody would watch an in-game live feed and log the catcher’s signals into the spreadsheet, as well as the type of pitch that was actually thrown. With that information, Codebreaker determined how the signs corresponded with different pitches. Once decided, that information would be communicated through intermediaries to a baserunner, who would relay them to the hitter.\n\n> Starting around June 2017, the system was embellished by Astros players. They started watching a live game feed on a monitor near the dugout and then would bang on a trash can to communicate the coming pitch to the batter. The “banging scheme” lasted through the 2017 World Series, which the Astros won over the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nLate in the 2017 season, MLB caught the Boston Red Sox relaying signs from their video room to an Apple watch worn by a trainer sitting in the dugout. Commissioner Rob Manfred fined the Red Sox and issued a strong warning to all teams against illegal electronic sign-stealing. It was suspected (accurately, as it turns out) that the New York Yankees had also been using technology to steal signs in 2015 and 2016. Despite these incidences, and the MLB warning, the Astros continue with “Codebreaker.”\n\nThe Astros’ scheme lasted into the 2018 season, in road games as well as home games, even though other teams were very suspicious that the Astros were stealing signs. Other teams often changed their own signs several times a game in an attempt to thwart the suspected sign stealing by the Astros. An executive for an opposing team was quoted as saying “The whole industry knows they’ve been cheating their asses off for three or four years. Everybody knew it.” Indeed, many teams had complained to MLB’s executives about the Astros’ cheating. Some suspect the cheating continued through the 2019 season, though others think not.\n\nFor the uninitiated, sign-stealing might not seem like it would give a big advantage. After all, even if a batter knows that a certain pitch is coming, he still has to hit it. It can’t be easy hitting a 100-mph fastball or a major league-caliber slider, even if you know it’s coming. Nonetheless, the advantage is substantial. According to the Washington Nationals’ pitching coach Paul Menhart, “It’s the worst feeling in the world stepping on that mound and having an idea that the hitter knows what’s coming. It’s one of the most unnerving feelings. You feel helpless. You just get ticked off to the point where you lose total focus and confidence.”\n\nThere is no question that many of the Astros players were actively involved in the scheme. The Astros manager, AJ Hinch, clearly knew about it. There is substantial, though perhaps not airtight evidence, that General Manager Rob Luhnhow also knew. Carlos Beltran, a Hall-of-Fame caliber player near the end of his 20-year playing career, was a leader in the scheme. Bench coach Alex Cora was a primary instigator. Owner Jim Crane appears not to have known of the dark arts being practiced by his club.\n\nThe scandal became public on November 12, 2019, when former Astros’ pitcher Mike Fiers blew the whistle in an interview published in “The Athletic.” MLB then launched an investigation that granted the Astros players immunity in return for their fessing up. Commissioner Rob Manfred soon issued a nine-page report that found that most of the Astros players knew of the scheme and many participated in it. The report also found that manager Hinch knew of the scheme and that GM Luhnow should have prevented it. Manfred suspended both Hinch and Luhnow, who were quickly fired by Astros’ owner Crane. MLB fined the Astros $5 million and stripped the club of its first- and second-round draft picks in both 2020 and 2021. Cora and Beltran lost managing jobs they had acquired.\n\nThe damage done by the Astros is significant. As veteran catcher Stephen Vogt said, “The integrity of our game is what we have, and now that’s been broken.” Former major-leaguer Doug Glanville concluded that MLB now faces an “existential crisis” saying that the Astros’ “selfish act makes everyone question the validity of the future and the truth of the past.” "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If I were in this situation, I would immediately report the sign-stealing scheme known as \"Codebreaker\" to the appropriate authorities within the Houston Astros organization, such as the team owner Jim Crane or the MLB commissioner's office.

The student-athlete was about to enter his freshman year at UNC—in the fall of 2007—yet he took an upper-level class before completing a 100- or 200-level course. A syllabus for the summer course did not exist. Most freshmen at UNC were not typically allowed to take 400-level courses without special permission from professors or advanced placement.\n\nThis and other cases were part of the evidence in allegations of academic fraud against UNC in a report released by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 2015. The report references “unchecked” coursework in which many student-athletes at UNC enrolled in fraudulent classes in the AFAM department or were given special advantages over the course of 18 years. As the report stated, “These were classes that involved no interaction with a faculty member, required no class attendance or course work other than a single paper, and resulted in consistently high grades.”\n\nJulius Nyang’oro, professor and department chair of AFAM, oversaw this system. Deborah Crowder, who was a secretary with the department, operated the “paper” classes, often categorized as independent study courses. Several counselors in UNC’s Office of Academic Support Program for Student Athletes also knew of these classes. In some cases, the counselors steered students to them. These courses enabled student-athletes with poor academic performance to continue to be eligible to play sports. The courses were also open to non-athletes and became popular among fraternity members.\n\nUltimately, the scheme became so brazen that an academic counselor wrote an e-mail to Ms. Crowder that said: “Hi, Debby. Yes, a D will be fine; that’s all she needs. I didn’t look at the paper but figured out it was a recycled one as well, but I couldn’t figure out from where! Thanks for whatever you can do.”\n\nMany of the staff members implicated in the allegations were named by Mary Willingham, a learning specialist at UNC who went public with details about the ongoing operations. “I was part of something that I came to be ashamed of,” she said, “We weren’t serving the kids. We weren’t educating them properly. We were pushing them toward graduation, and that’s not the same as giving them an education.”\n\nThe concern over giving student-athletes an education raised larger questions about the balance between strong academics and strong athletics at major universities. Richard Southall, director of the College Sport Research Institute at the University of South Carolina, stated, “We pretend that it’s feasible to recruit high school graduates with minimal academic qualifications, give them a full-time job as a football or basketball player at a Division I NCAA school, and somehow have them get up to college-level reading and writing skills at the same time that they’re enrolled in college-level classes.” He added, “We’re kidding ourselves.”\n\nThe Southern Association of Colleges and Schools accreditation organization placed UNC on probation for one year. UNC instituted reforms with higher governance standards, accountability for student-athlete support programs, and classroom and coursework audits. In 2017, the NCAA concluded its investigation. While the organization agreed that UNC was guilty of academic fraud, it did not punish the university or its athletic program.

Federal law states that “any justice or judge shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might be questioned.” Critics of Justice Scalia thought it reasonable to question his impartiality. Stephen Gillers, a New York University law professor and expert on legal ethics, noted:\n\n> “A judge may have a friendship with a lawyer, and that’s fine. But if the lawyer has a case before the judge, they don’t socialize until it’s over. That shows a proper respect for maintaining the public’s confidence in the integrity of the process.”\n\nDefenders of Justice Scalia argued that these criticisms were politically motivated by people who wished that Scalia not be able to vote in the case. They said it is common for justices to be friends with political actors who might be involved in cases coming before the Court. Defending his actions, Scalia stated:\n\n> “Social contacts with high-level executive officials…have never been thought improper for judges who may have before them cases in which those people are involved… For example, Supreme Court Justices are regularly invited to dine at the White House, whether or not a suit seeking to compel or prevent certain presidential action is pending.” "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would recommend that Justice Scalia recuse himself from the case to avoid any appearance of bias or impropriety.

Public outcry criticized Fallin for appropriating Native American cultures, sparking uproar on social media and leading to protests at their shows.\n\nIn response, Fallin and Pink Pony removed the photo and released a statement on their Facebook page explaining their aesthetic appreciation for Native American culture. Fallin told the Indian Country Today Media Network that, “I think Native American culture is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, so I was naturally drawn to it.” Musician Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips became involved in the issue when he fired bandmate Kliph Scurlock for criticizing Fallin online. To show his support for Fallin, Coyne posted Instagram photos of several friends and a dog wearing headdresses.\n\nSome argue that Fallin’s photo could be an example of artistic appropriation. Throughout history, artists have borrowed objects and images from everyday life as well as other cultures in order to re-contextualize the object in a new manner. On the other hand, some argue that non-Native Americans do not have the right to adorn a headdress at all. Taking a sacred or meaningful object out of context is problematic even when touted as “art.” Summer Morgan, member of the Kiowa tribe in Oklahoma, believes that Fallin may have had good intentions, but there are better ways to express her appreciation of Native American cultures. Morgan believes that headdresses are not fashion accessories. Following Kiowa tradition, only men can own war bonnets and each feather represents a war deed.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nIn December 2015, representatives from 195 nations gathered in Paris and signed an international agreement to address climate change, which many observers called a breakthrough for several reasons. First, the fact that a deal was struck at all was a major accomplishment, given the failure of previous climate change talks. Second, unlike previous climate change accords that focused exclusively on developed countries, this pact committed both developed and developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the voluntary targets established by nations in the Paris climate deal fall considerably short of what many scientists deem necessary to achieve the stated goal of the negotiations: limiting the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, since the established targets are voluntary, they may be lowered or abandoned due to political resistance, short-term economic crises, or simply social fatigue or disinterest.\n\nAs philosophy professor Stephen Gardiner aptly explains, the challenge of climate change presents the world with several fundamental ethical dilemmas. It is simultaneously a profoundly global, intergenerational, and philosophical problem. First, from a global perspective, climate change presents the world with a collective action problem: all countries have a collective interest in controlling global carbon emissions. But each individual country also has incentives to over-consume (in this case, to emit as much carbon as necessary) in response to societal demands for economic growth and prosperity.\n\nSecond, as an intergenerational problem, the consequences of actions taken by the current generation will have the greatest impact on future generations yet to be born. Thus, the current generation must forego benefits today in order to protect against possibly catastrophic costs in the future. This tradeoff is particularly difficult for developing countries. They must somehow achieve economic growth in the present to break out of a persistent cycle of poverty, while limiting the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted into the atmosphere to protect future generations. The fact that prosperous, developed countries (such as the U.S. and those in Europe) arguably created the current climate problems during their previous industrial economic development in the 19th and 20th centuries complicates the tradeoffs between economic development and preventing further climate change.\n\nFinally, the global and intergenerational nature of climate change points to the underlying philosophical dimensions of the problem. While it is intuitive that the current generation has some ethical responsibility to leave an inhabitable world to future generations, the extent of this obligation is less clear. The same goes for individual countries who have pledged to reduce carbon emissions to help protect environmental health, but then face real economic and social costs when executing those pledges. Developing nations faced with these costs may encounter further challenges as the impact of climate change will most likely fall disproportionally on the poor, thus also raising issues of fairness and inequality.

Even the Queen of England had an account there. In 1989, Nick Leeson was hired at Barings, where he prospered. He was quickly promoted to the trading floor and appointed manager in Singapore where he traded on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX). Leeson was an aggressive trader, making large profits in speculative trading. In 1993, his profits constituted almost 10% of Barings’ total profits. He had developed a reputation for expertise, for near-infallibility, and his superiors in London gave him little supervision.\n\nIn July 1992, a new Barings employee suffered a small loss on Leeson’s watch. Leeson did not wish to lose his reputation for infallibility, or his job, so he hid the loss in an error account. Leeson attempted to make back the loss through speculative trading, but this led to even bigger losses, which again were hidden in this account. He kept doubling up his bets in an attempt to get out from under the losses. Leeson later said:\n\n> “[I] wanted to shout from the rooftops…this is what the situation is, there are massive losses, I want to stop. But for some reason you’re unable to do it. … I had this catastrophic secret which was burning up inside me—yet…I simply couldn’t open my mouth and say, ‘I’ve lost millions and millions of pounds.’”\n\nLeeson took out a short-term, highly leveraged bet on the Nikkei index in Japan. At the same time, a severe earthquake in Kobe, Japan sent the index plummeting, and his loss was so huge that he could no longer hide it. Barings, a 233-year old bank, collapsed overnight and was bought by ING for £1. Leeson fled to Malaysia, Thailand, and finally to Germany, where he was arrested and extradited to Singapore. He plead guilty to two counts of deceiving bank auditors (including forging documents) and cheating the SIMEX.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nArt Briles is without question one of the best high school football coaches in the history of Texas high school football. Starting as an assistant coach at a small town, his intelligence, drive, attention to detail, and creativity led him to head coaching jobs at larger and larger schools. He turned a floundering program at Stephenville High School into a powerhouse that won multiple state championships and intimidated even much larger high schools’ football teams.\n\nNot without ambition, Briles then took an assistant coaching job at Texas Tech University and soon became a successful head coach at the University of Houston. Then, he took the top job at Baylor University. Baylor is an “unambiguously Christian” university. Its website read (at the time): “In a world where faith is often the casualty of a serious pursuit of academic achievement, Baylor is a special case.” Baylor’s chancellor and president, Ken Starr, was an enthusiastic promoter of Christian values. Baylor’s athletic director, Ian McCaw, was described by former Clemson football coach Tommy Bowden as a “fine Christian man.”\n\nBriles seemed like a good fit for Baylor. As Briles often explains, his Christian faith is very important to him. A columnist wrote that Briles was “polite, courteous, and respectful in a way that harkens back to a different era. He is a good man with a good family.” Baylor used its Christian values, as embodied in its Christian leaders, as a lure to recruit students and student-athletes.\n\nIn 2008, Briles began as Baylor’s head football coach with the goal of ending a 12-year-string of losing records. It was a struggle during the first two years. But Briles’ recruiting ability, coaching acumen, and endless energy soon revived the dormant program. In 2010, Baylor had a winning record and went to its first of six straight bowl games. Soon after, Baylor became a team that was annually in the conversation for the nation’s best team. Baylor sent numerous players to the NFL and their quarterback, Robert Griffin III, won the Heisman trophy.\n\nOn the surface, all seemed well on the Baylor campus, especially at its brand-new $266 million football stadium. The campus was abuzz with energy and excitement over the football team’s success, which is not surprising in Texas. In 2013, Nick Eatman published *Art Briles: Looking Up: My Journey from Tragedy to Triumph*. And in 2014, Briles wrote and published an autobiography, *Beating Goliath: My Story of Football and Faith*.\n\nBut all was not well on the Baylor campus. In November 2014, Briles published his autobiography and the football team went 11-2. Baylor rose to as high as #4 in the national rankings. The same year, Patty Crawford was named Baylor’s first full-time Title IX coordinator. In her first two years in that role, Crawford received 400 reports of sexual harassment, violence, and assault. Seventeen of those victims made complaints of sexual assault or domestic violence against nineteen football players, including four alleged gang rapes. Crawford said that cases involving football players involved 10% of her caseload even though football players constituted only 4% of the student body. Lawsuits later alleged 52 rapes by 31 football players from 2011 to 2014.\n\nAccording to Paula Lavigne and Mark Schlabach in their book *Violated: Exposing Rape at Baylor University Amid College Football’s Sexual Assault Crisis*, Crawford said (regarding the gang rapes): “…the younger guys saw what was happening and that no one ever got in trouble for it, and the behavior continued. ‘It was just this weird mentality at Baylor that I haven’t seen anywhere else.’”\n\nThroughout Briles’ tenure at Baylor, women were assaulted by football players. Not much was done if these women complained to the university. This, of course, discouraged others from complaining so the incidents piled up.\n\nThe evidence indicates that Baylor’s chancellor Starr was largely unaware of what was going on. His fault lay primarily in not giving attention to ensuring that Baylor was meeting its Title IX obligations to police, investigate, and punish such wrongdoing. As president and chancellor, this was ultimately Starr’s obligation.\n\nBriles mostly claimed ignorance. He apologized to the board of regents for not knowing what was going on, although there was quite a bit of evidence that he did know. Many students and parents claimed to have made complaints to the football program. But Briles, who seemed to have a good memory when he wrote his autobiography, repeatedly said that he had no memory of complaints, messages, or conversations that victims claimed occurred. But e-mails and text messages surfaced which showed that Briles often knew of complaints and did his best to ensure that they were kept quiet rather than alert university officials in the Title IX office as he was supposed to do. Baylor’s athletic director McCaw sometimes did the same.\n\nIn one instance, a football player was arrested for assaulting and threatening to kill a male student (a non-athlete). In response, Briles and McCaw exchanged these messages:\n\n> **BRILES**: Just talked to [the player]—he said Waco PD was there—said they were going to keep it quiet—Wasn’t a set up deal… I’ll get shill [Baylor director of football operations Colin Shillinglaw] to ck on Sibley [a defense attorney often used by Baylor football players].\n>\n> **McCAW**: That would be great if they kept it quiet!\n\nWhen these cases began showing up in the press, Baylor could no longer play the silent game. The Board of Regents took charge and hired a law firm, Pepper Hamilton, to investigate. Its report was not pretty. Among other factual conclusions that the Board reached after reviewing the Pepper Hamilton report (which it refused to release to the public) were these:\n\n> Baylor failed to maintain effective oversight and supervision of the Athletics Department as it related to the effective implementation of Title IX. Leadership challenges and communication issues hindered enforcement of rules and policies, and created a cultural perception that football was above the rules….\n>\n> Baylor failed to take appropriate action to respond to reports of sexual assault and dating violence reportedly committed by football players. The choices made by football staff and athletics leadership, in some instances, posed a risk to campus safety and the integrity of the University. In certain instances, including reports of a sexual assault by multiple football players, athletics and football personnel affirmatively chose not to report sexual violence and dating violence to an appropriate administrator outside of athletics. In those instances, football coaches or staff met directly with a complainant and/or a parent of a complainant and did not report the misconduct. As a result, no action was taken to support complainants, fairly and impartially evaluate the conduct under Title IX, address identified cultural concerns within the football program or protect campus safety once aware of a potential pattern of sexual violence by multiple football players.\n\nIn addition, some football coaches and staff took improper steps in response to disclosures of sexual assault or dating violence that precluded the University from fulfilling its legal obligations. Football staff conducted their own untrained internal inquiries, outside of policy, which improperly discredited complainants and denied them the right to a fair, impartial and informed investigation, interim measures or processes promised under University Policy. In some cases, internal steps gave the illusion of responsiveness to complainants but failed to provide a meaningful institutional response under Title IX. Further, because reports were not shared outside of athletics, the University missed critical opportunities to impose appropriate disciplinary action that would have removed offenders from campus and possibly precluded future acts of sexual violence against Baylor students. In some instances, the football program dismissed players for unspecified team violations and assisted them in transferring to other schools….\n\nIn addition to the failures related to sexual assault and dating violence, individuals within the football program actively sought to maintain internal control over discipline for other forms of misconduct. Athletics personnel failed to recognize the conflicts of interest in roles and the risk to campus safety by insulating athletes from student conduct processes. Football coaches and staff took affirmative steps to maintain internal control over discipline of players and to actively divert cases from the student conduct or criminal processes. In some cases, football coaches and staff had inappropriate involvement in disciplinary and criminal matters or engaged in improper conduct that reinforced an overall perception that football was above the rules, and that there was no culture of accountability for misconduct.\n\nThe regents ultimately fired or forced the resignations of Starr, McCaw, and Briles.

Posting hurtful messages about other people is a form of harassment known as cyberbullying. Some acts of cyberbullying may not only be considered slanderous, but also lead to serious consequences. In 2010, Rutgers University student Tyler Clementi jumped to his death a few days after his roommate used a webcam to observe and tweet about Tyler’s sexual encounter with another man. Jane Clementi, Tyler’s mother, stated:\n\n> “In this digital world, we need to teach our youngsters that their actions have consequences, that their words have real power to hurt or to help.

After discovering that one of her students tweeted that the teacher was a “bitch” and a “whore,” Hernández confronted the girl during a lesson on social media etiquette.

Although most people are free to speak their minds online, public figures face unique challenges.

In 1999, two teenagers created the file-sharing program Napster. Within its first year, the service surpassed 20 million users. Many Napster users shared music files with each other, but without any compensation to the artists and producers who made the music, sparking a series of legal battles over copyright and distribution. In 2001, an appellate panel upheld a previous ruling that Napster violated copyright laws, stating that:\n\n> “Repeated and exploitative unauthorized copies of copyrighted works were made to save the expense of purchasing authorized copies.”\n\nArtists were divided on the benefits and harms of Napster. Over 70 artists formed “Artists Against Piracy” in coalition with major record companies to combat the piracy occurring on Napster and other peer-to-peer internet services. In contrast, some established artists such as Neil Young saw piracy as the “new radio” and applauded the potential to reach larger audiences and drive additional sales through increased popularity. Seeing both the benefits and detriments of piracy, singer Norah Jones stated:\n\n> “If people hear it I’m happy…it’s great that young people who don’t have a lot of money can listen to music and be exposed to new things… But I also understand it’s not ideal for the record industry, and a lot of young artists who won’t make any [money] off their album sales, but at least they can tour.”\n\nAlthough court rulings forced Napster to terminate its file-sharing business, Napster’s innovations stimulated payment-based services, such as iTunes, Pandora, and many others. But the availability of such services has not put an end to the debate surrounding artist compensation with digital music, as seen with Taylor Swift’s open letter to Apple in 2015. Swift’s albums, along with the music of many other artists, were going to be streamed at no cost to new Apple Music customers over the first three months of service without any compensation to the artists. In her open letter, Swift stated:\n\n> “I’m not sure you know that Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months.

What began as an article about a unique new golf putter gradually became an article about the inventor of the putter, Dr. Essay Anne Vanderbilt. In his investigation into Vanderbilt’s invention, Hannan discovered that Vanderbilt had lied about her academic background and work experience and had taken cash from an investor that she never returned.\n\nHannan also found out that Vanderbilt was a transgender woman and outed her as trans to an investor. Although Hannan had made an agreement with Vanderbilt to focus the story “on the science, not the scientist,” the putter became a backdrop to a story about what Hannan saw as a deceitful personal life and fraudulent professional career. Vanderbilt, who wished to maintain her privacy from the start, did not want the story published. A few months before Grantland published the article, Vanderbilt committed suicide.\n\nThe article sparked immediate controversy over the merits and ethics of its reporting, as well as its role in Vanderbilt’s suicide. Detractors criticized Hannan and Grantland for a lack of awareness and compassion regarding trans issues. Defenders of the article saw value in the story and believed it would be dangerous to not report all of the facts. In an editorial response published in Grantland, sports journalist Christina Kahrl wrote, “It was not Grantland’s job to out [Vanderbilt],” noting, “she was a member of a community…for whom suicide attempts outpace the national average almost 26 times over.” Josh Levin, executive editor at Slate, wrote:\n\n“The fact that Dr. V once lived under a different name is not irrelevant to Hannan’s story… But presenting Dr. V’s gender identity as one in a series of lies and elisions was a careless editorial decision. …Dr. V is a con artist and a trans woman. Hannan, though, conflates those two facts…”\n\nJournalist James Kirchick defended Hannan, writing:\n\n“What I saw was a careful and ingenious reporter ferret out a fraud with care. …[There’s] no evidence that Hannan was…seeking to “out” and humiliate a transgender woman… On the contrary, in his article, Hannan arrives at a conclusion sympathetic to Vanderbilt.”\n\nTrans advocate and medical doctor Dana Beyer said that the article reflected the tragedy of being in the closet as trans, but did not revel in it or have malicious intentions.\n\nSeveral days after the publication of the article, Grantland editor-in-chief Bill Simmons published a response to the article’s criticism.

East Germany (the German Democratic Republic—GDR) became part of the Eastern Bloc under the USSR's influence, while West Germany aligned with the U.S. and Western Europe. Facing economic struggles and mass defections to the West, the GDR built the Berlin Wall to prevent its citizens from leaving.\n\nIn the 1960s, the GDR government aimed to showcase the superiority of its communist system through athletic success. A secret law mandated the use of performance-enhancing drugs in athletes' training. Coaches and doctors implemented a systematic doping program, recruiting young athletes and administering anabolic steroids, notably Oral-Turinabol, often presented as \"vitamins.\" Athletes were required to take these pills and forbidden from discussing them.\n\nWhile some young athletes may have initially believed they were taking vitamins, most eventually realized they were using performance-enhancing drugs. Male athletes experienced increased muscle mass and stamina, while female athletes saw even more pronounced effects.\n\nBetween 1968 and the late 1980s, approximately 9,000 GDR athletes were doped, leading to significant successes in international competitions, especially the Olympics. In the 1968 Olympics, the GDR women's swim team won 11 of 13 gold medals, raising suspicions. The U.S. women's team managed to win only one gold medal, notably in the 4×100-meter relay, where they upset the favored East Germans.\n\nMany GDR athletes were aware of the illegal doping and had misgivings but generally complied with their coaches and doctors. One swimmer recalled:\n\n> \"The training motto at the pool was, 'You eat the pills, or you die.' It was forbidden to refuse.\"\n\nSome athletes resisted. One female swimmer, who gained 45 pounds of muscle, recounted:\n\n> \"I just woke one day and said this feels like sh*t. It’s wrong, it’s cheating, and I feel horrible. When I said no, no more pills, no more needles, the coaches freaked out. They kept trying to convince me to dope, but I refused. Shortly afterward, my performances fell behind my other training partners, so they moved me into the lazy group. I was no longer a member of the GDR elite. There was fighting and arguing and it got ugly, so in 1979, right before [the] Moscow [Olympics], I just quit. Hung up my suit.\n\n> I knew we were on something. Everybody was getting enormous, and we are talking about young women, teenagers, here; so we all knew that we were being doped, but we were forbidden to talk to anyone or to each other. It was like prison. I got called before the Central Committee, the big STASI [the GDR’s secret police force] honchos; they wanted me to take the vitamins and keep swimming; but I told them forget it, it was wrong and dangerous. They thought I was nuts, so they cut me loose. I also believe that some of the young girls loved the way their swim times dropped and their recovery from hard workouts, so they didn’t complain; they rather enjoyed it.\"\n\nBy the late 1980s, Olympic doping authorities began uncovering the GDR's practices. Doctors and coaches, aware of the adverse effects of Oral-Turinabol, continued the doping regimen. Men experienced shrinking genitalia; women developed enlarged clitorises, excessive body hair, deepened voices, and increased aggression. Both genders suffered from severe acne, liver damage, heart disease, various cancers, infertility, and birth defects in offspring.

The epidemic caught world health authorities off guard, ultimately killing thousands and threatening to develop into a worldwide epidemic. A broad range of organizations and politicians, from health care authorities and Doctors Without Borders to the World Health Organization and Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, made dramatic appeals for American military intervention. The legacy of colonial ties affected the perceptions of responsibility for provision of assistance. The United Kingdom took charge of relief efforts in Sierra Leone, France in Guinea, and the United States in Liberia, a state founded in the 19th century by former African-American slaves.\n\nAfter initially receiving criticism for acting too cautiously, President Obama responded by sending over 3,000 military personnel, mostly medics and engineers, to Liberia. It was the largest American intervention ever in a global health crisis. President Obama justified this decision by arguing that the United States had an ethical obligation as a leader of the global community to address the humanitarian crisis in Liberia as well as a security interest in controlling the epidemic in Africa so that it did not spread to the U.S. and other countries. According to President Obama, only the American military had the resources, hierarchical structure, and discipline to carry out such a largescale effort.\n\nObjections to the “militarization” of this relief effort came in several forms. Conservative critics argued that militaries are for fighting and winning wars, not providing humanitarian assistance. Others argued the humanitarian effort could morph into security and military engagement. David Ridenhour, president of the National Center for Public Policy Research, worried that American soldiers could be faced with difficult moral dilemmas, such as “having to shoot unarmed, possibly infected Liberian civilians or allow Ebola to spread.” Some critics were concerned that U.S. military intervention jeopardized the principle of neutrality that health relief organizations try to maintain. Historian Andrew Bacevich argued that a military response to a humanitarian crisis, even if successful, would mask and perpetuate gross misallocation of resources toward building military capacity rather than address global health care needs.\n\nUltimately, the Ebola epidemic was brought under control in Liberia and the rest of Western Africa. The United States military built 11 treatment units and the government expended hundreds of millions of dollars in the relief effort. However, as The New York Times reported, there is limited evidence that these efforts played any significant role. Only 28 Ebola patients were treated in the 11 treatment centers built by the military. The number of new Ebola cases peaked at 635 the week after President Obama announced the military intervention, but dropped to just over 100 by the time the first medical unit was opened.

Yet despite the fact that he broke the law, Snowden argued that he had a moral obligation to act. He gave a justification for his “whistleblowing” by stating that he had a duty “to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them.” According to Snowden, the government’s violation of privacy had to be exposed regardless of legality.\n\nMany agreed with Snowden. Jesselyn Radack of the Government Accountability Project defended his actions as ethical, arguing that he acted from a sense of public good.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nHome DNA testing is a booming business. Millions of Americans have sent their DNA to commercial testing companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry to learn more about their heritage or potential for disease. According to Grand View Research, “the global DNA testing market is set to reach over $10 billion by 2022.” (Brown 2018). Successful marketing campaigns have led consumers to believe that home DNA testing is fun, informative, and personal to them. However, what consumers may not realize is that once their genetic information is shared, they have limited control as to who has access to it.\n\nRegardless of the reason consumers decide to purchase a home DNA test kit, the information they provide to the testing company is far greater than the information they receive. The benefits that these testing companies can gain from gathering, using, and selling customers’ private information places them in a significant conflict-of-interest situation. Some of this information includes the IP address, name, address, email, and family history, collected from the application, as well as information provided on follow up surveys. Furthermore, according to its website, if customers opt to share their data for research, 23andMe could keep their physical spit sample and the genetic data it contains for up to a decade. Additional information that consumers upload to the companies’ genealogy website, such as pictures, obituaries, family relationships, and even third-party information is probably added to the pool of data linked to customers’ DNA.\n\nRecently, some have felt that privacy and consumer rights have been violated when they used home DNA kits. In June 2019, Lori Collett sued Ancestry for allegedly misleading customers about what it was doing with their DNA. This class action lawsuit claims that personal information was released to outside parties without customer consent. Further contentions include that the waiver of consumer rights through consent forms is often vague, general in scope, and ever-changing. The fine print may not accurately spell out what the company, its third-party associates, and collaborators can or will do with customer information. (Merken, 2019)\n\nFurther concerns arise as testing companies often align themselves with pharmaceutical companies, public and private research organizations, and Google. For example, “GlaxoSmithKline purchased a $300 million stake in the company, allowing the pharmaceutical giant to use 23andMe’s trove of genetic data to develop new drugs — and raising new privacy concerns for consumers.” (Ducharme, 2018) Similarly, Ancestry is sharing its data with Google through its research subsidiary Calico. Ancestry admits that “once they share people’s genetic information with partner companies, they can’t be responsible for security protocols of those partners.” (Leavenworth, 2018).\n\nAdditionally, both 23andMe and Ancestry use Google Analytics to provide third parties with consumer information for targeted marketing. In its privacy policy 23andMe states that “when you use our Services, including our website or mobile app(s), our third-party service providers may collect Web-Behavior Information about your visit, such as the links you clicked on, the duration of your visit, and the URLs you visited.” This use of shared information allows testing services and third parties to build a comprehensive personal profile on you, which may include your genetic information.\n\nAlthough privacy may be a concern of consumers, law enforcement with the cooperation of DNA testing companies, either through partnership or warrants, have brought justice to the victims of numerous unsolved cases. Over the past few years, the use of consumer DNA databases have closed many high profile cold cases such as the Golden State Killer and overturned the wrongful conviction of Alfred Swinton. In some cases, such as the Golden State Killer, the DNA used to identify suspects are cross-referenced through the DNA of relatives as far removed as third cousins. However, this has brought additional concerns, as a DNA expert for the American Civil Liberties Union, Vera Eidelman states, “There’s always a danger that things will be used beyond their initial targets, beyond their initial purpose.” (St. John 2019)\n\nThe success of consumer DNA databases has led some law enforcement to meet with Bennett Greenspan, the CEO of FamilyTreeDNA, seeking his help to convince consumers to share their genetic data with police. This partnership has resulted in the creation of the non-profit Institute for DNA Justice that has the following stated mission:\n\n> “The Institute for DNA Justice was formed to educate the public about the value of investigative genetic genealogy (IGG) as a revolutionary new tool to identify, arrest, and convict violent criminals, deter violent crime, exonerate the innocent, encourage the 26 million Americans who have taken a DNA test to become genetic witnesses by participating in publicly available family-matching databases working with law enforcement using IGG, and to promote the adoption of industry leading best practices guidelines surrounding its use by law enforcement agencies around the country.”\n\nRegardless of public or private testing, laws in the United States have not yet determined a standard for the home DNA testing industry.

During the investigation, the FBI attempted to access the data stored on the device but was unable to bypass its encryption. The Obama administration's legal team approached Apple for assistance in unlocking the phone; however, negotiations soon reached an impasse. Subsequently, the Justice Department secured a court order compelling Apple to aid the FBI in unlocking the device. Apple's CEO, Timothy Cook, publicly contested the court's directive in an open letter, igniting a vigorous debate over the balance between national security and individual privacy.\n\nApple, along with supporters including major technology companies like Google and Facebook, argued that the court order posed a threat to individual privacy on multiple fronts. Firstly, Apple contended that the order effectively mandated the company to write code, thereby violating its First Amendment right to free speech by compelling it to \"say\" something against its will. Previous legal cases had already established computer code as a form of protected speech. Secondly, Apple expressed concern that creating such a backdoor could potentially fall into the wrong hands, jeopardizing the privacy of all iPhone users. Lastly, Apple warned that complying with the order would set a dangerous precedent, enabling law enforcement to repeatedly require businesses like Apple to assist in criminal investigations, effectively turning technology companies into agents of the government.\n\nOn the other hand, representatives from both sides of the political spectrum presented several arguments in favor of the Justice Department's position and against Apple's stance. Their primary assertion was that the U.S. legal system establishes constraints on the government's access to private information, preventing abuse of search and surveillance powers. Simultaneously, the law permits authorities to access information that facilitates the prevention and prosecution of criminal activities, ranging from terrorism to drug trafficking to child exploitation. Critics of Apple also dismissed the slippery slope argument, asserting that if Apple cooperated, it could safeguard the code it created and prevent it from falling into the hands of malicious actors, including terrorists or criminal organizations.

The flag and the pole on which it was flown were both removed the following day. Leading up to this removal was heated debate concerning whether or not the Confederate flag should be taken down. Similar discussions occurred across the United States in places where Confederate flags or other Confederate symbols were on display, ranging from governmental properties and university campuses to NASCAR venues and popular television series.\n\nPrior to the flag’s official removal from the front of the South Carolina State House, police arrested activist Brittany Newsome for climbing the flagpole and removing the flag herself. The activist explained her act of defiance, stating, “because it was the right thing to do and it was time for somebody to step up. Do the right thing. We have to bury hate; it’s been too long.” South Carolina Representative Jenny Anderson Horne, an ancestor of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis, argued that the Confederate flag should no longer fly in front of the State House.

Roof had been recently charged with the racially motivated killing of nine black people in a Charleston church. South Carolina State Senator Lee Bright noted that symbols have been misused throughout history.

These offenses included verbal, emotional, and physical abuse.\n\nAt Yale University, administrators sent an email to students advising them to avoid racially insensitive Halloween costumes, such as those featuring blackface or mock Native American headdresses. Controversy arose when Erika Christakis, a white lecturer of early childhood education and associate master at one of the university’s residential colleges, emailed the students she oversaw, objecting to the call for sensitivity. Christakis questioned what she described as an “institutional… exercise of implied control over college students,” asking, “Is there no room anymore for a child or young person to be a little bit obnoxious… a little bit inappropriate or provocative or, yes, offensive?” In response, many students signed an open letter to Christakis, stating:\n\n> “We are not asking to be coddled… [We] simply ask that our existences not be invalidated on campus. This is us asking for basic respect of our cultures and our livelihoods.”\n\nDuring a protest, a student confronted Christakis’s husband, Nicholas Christakis, a professor at Yale and master of one of the residential colleges. The students told him to step down, asserting that being a master was “not about creating an intellectual space… [but] creating a home here.”\n\nAt the University of Missouri, administrators were criticized for their slow and ineffective responses to ongoing racial tensions on campus. After Payton Head, a Black student and president of the Missouri Student Association, was taunted with racial slurs, it took university chancellor R. Bowen Loftin nearly a week to respond. Following this and other incidents, students organized rallies and demonstrations. Tensions escalated after someone used feces to smear a swastika on a communal bathroom in a residence hall. This act of vandalism became the final straw for graduate student Jonathan Butler, who had led or been involved in many demonstrations up to that point. He decided to go on an indefinite hunger strike until university system president Tim Wolfe was removed from office. In support of Butler, the football team announced they would neither practice nor play until Wolfe resigned. Many students joined in support of the protests. Butler ended his weeklong hunger strike after Wolfe resigned.\n\nAmid the student protests at Missouri, further controversy emerged when protesters tried to keep news media out of the campus public grounds where they had been camping out for days. Student photographer Tim Tai, on assignment for ESPN, was surrounded and confronted by protesters, including university staff members, who did not want any media to enter what they said was a “safe space.” Tai was attempting to document the protests in public spaces, stating:\n\n> “This is the First Amendment that protects your right to stand here and mine. …The law protects both of us.”\n\nA video capturing the confrontation went viral and sparked wider debate over the issue of freedom of speech in the protests at Missouri, Yale, and other college campuses. Journalists, commentators, and academics raised discussions over the roles of free speech, deliberation, and tolerance in the dialogue between student activists and university administrators.\n\nFreelance journalist Terrell Jermaine Starr, in defense of the protesters, wrote:\n\n> “This wasn’t a problem with Tai’s character or his journalistic integrity; he was doing his job… but reporters should also feel a responsibility to try to understand and respect [the protesters’] pain…”\n\nStarr continued:\n\n> “In many communities that historically have been marginalized and unfairly portrayed by the media, there’s good reason people do not trust journalists: They often criminalize black people’s pain and resistance to racial oppression.”\n\nSuzanne Nossel, executive director of PEN American Center, defended free speech as a crucial driver of social justice reform:\n\n> “[Without] free speech, the ‘safe spaces’ students crave will soon suffocate them. Social movements must evolve or they die. Ideological and even tactical evolution demands willingness to hear out heterodoxy. Likewise, free speech defenders will not win by dismissing students as insolent whiners. …The Black Lives Matter movement and the campus protests are efforts to jump-start a drive for racial equality that has stalled in key areas. Free speech is essential to that quest.”\n\nWriting about the Yale incident, journalist Conor Friedersdorf suggested that the student activists’ intolerance of other views could lead to censorship. He wrote, “[Students] were perfectly free to talk about their pain. Some felt entitled to something more, and that is what prolonged the debate.” Op-ed columnist Nicholas Kristof addressed the broader role of freedom of speech on college campuses:\n\n> “The protesters at Mizzou and Yale and elsewhere make a legitimate point: Universities should work harder to make all students feel they are safe and belong. Members of minorities—whether black or transgender or (on many campuses) evangelical conservatives—should be able to feel a part of campus, not feel mocked in their own community.”\n\nPolitical theorist Danielle Allen, on the other hand, described the debate over freedom of speech as a distraction from the key issues of the protests. Allen wrote:\n\n> “The issues of free speech matter, too, but they are leading people in the wrong direction, away from the deepest issue. …The real issue is how to think about social equality.” "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would first ensure that the safety and well-being of all students involved in the protests are prioritized.

Clinical social workers are the largest professional group providing mental health services in the United States, providing services in urban and rural outpatient and inpatient settings. Social workers are seen as different from clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and other occupational groups that provide therapy in the emphasis that social work places on social justice, cultural competence, and respect for diversity. According to the National Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics, the social work profession requires its members to:\n\n> “[A]ct to prevent and eliminate…discrimination against any person, group, or class on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, color, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, political belief, religion, or mental or physical disability.”\n\nAn ethical dilemma may arise when the religious or moral beliefs of the social worker interfere with the duty of all health care professionals to provide optimal service to clients and to “do no harm.” This issue made national headlines in a related context, when Kim Davis, a clerk in Rowan County, Kentucky, was jailed after defying a federal court order to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. Her action was based on her contention that to do so would violate her religious beliefs. In his ruling, Judge David L. Bunning of the United States District Court stated:\n\n> “If you give people the opportunity to choose which orders they follow, that’s what potentially causes problems.”\n\nIn defense of Davis, Ryan Anderson of the Heritage Foundation wrote:\n\n> “Ms. Davis felt she had to follow her conscience… That, after all, is what religious freedom and religious accommodations are all about: creating the space for citizens to fulfill their duties, as they understand them, to God—regardless of what the rest of us think.”\n\nA similar conflict between religious faith and the requirements of one’s job or one’s profession may be seen in social work practice in the following scenario:\n\nA clinical social worker has been treating a 25-year-old man for depression and anxiety. In the fourth session, the client reveals that he is gay, and that he has not “come out” to his family. He states that he has been involved in a committed, monogamous relationship with another man, and is contemplating marriage. He would like to inform his parents of this good news, but is fearful that they may angrily reject him. He is seeking counseling around this issue. The social worker belongs to a faith tradition that believes that homosexuality is a sin, and whose leaders have been prominent in opposing same-sex marriage.

Funded by taxpayers, grants, and individual donors, the shelter provides refuge for thousands of lost, unwanted, neglected, and abandoned animals annually.\n\nIn recent years, the Lied Animal Shelter faced significant challenges due to overcrowding, attributed to a surge in animal intake as residents in the greater Las Vegas area (Clark County) surrendered or lost their pets. Analysts believed that the 2008 recession was a major contributing factor to pet abandonment. April Corbin, writing for *Las Vegas Weekly*, reported:\n\n> “The Las Vegas Valley has a problem with domestic animals: we have more than we seem able or willing to handle, and those without homes mostly end up at the Lied Shelter. On any given day, it may be the busiest animal holding facility in the nation. …Some blame the recession, which led to the foreclosures of more than 150,000 homes in Clark County between January 2007 and May 2014, triggering the wholesale abandonment of animals.”\n\nIn 2013, the Lied Animal Shelter took in over 40,000 abandoned or lost animals. Of these, more than 10,000 were adopted, nearly 5,000 were reunited with their owners, and over 2,500 were transferred to other facilities. However, 21,000 animals—more than half of those brought to the shelter—were euthanized. Many in Clark County were discouraged by the seemingly insurmountable problems the shelter faced.\n\nLeaders at R&R Partners, a full-service international advertising agency headquartered in Las Vegas, believed their persuasive communication skills could help address the Animal Foundation’s challenges. R&R took on the nonprofit as a pro bono client with goals of promoting pet ownership and driving traffic to the Animal Foundation’s pet adoption website, NewPetNow.com. The agency conducted qualitative research through focus groups with R&R employees who were pet owners. They developed a strategy to frame pet adoption not about love and companionship but about pets’ many household uses (e.g., alarm system, sleeping mask, vacuum cleaner) with a tongue-in-cheek tone. The agency created an integrated communication campaign of “In-FUR-mercial” spoofs that portrayed pets as multi-purpose products for the home. Examples of the “Pet Dog” and “Pet Cat” In-FUR-mercials are available online.\n\nAfter the release of the ads in early 2015, the campaign received critical acclaim from industry analysts. *ADWEEK* contributor Gabriel Beltrone stated, “The writing is sharp and funny, the acting perfectly overdone, and the voiceover as cheesy as possible—dead-on parody.” The In-FUR-mercials also received CynopsisMedia’s award for the Best 30-Second Spot.\n\nThe campaign resonated with audiences in Las Vegas and generated positive press for the Animal Foundation and the Lied Shelter, helping them achieve their goal of increasing pet adoption. The percentage of available pets adopted increased by 9.39 percent during 2015, resulting in more than 1,000 additional animals being adopted.\n\nLeaders at R&R Partners acknowledged that the campaign also brought important benefits to the agency beyond the success and visibility of the campaign. Morale and camaraderie within the agency were enhanced, and the agency’s reputation as a responsible corporate citizen was reinforced. Sarah Catletti, an account supervisor at R&R Partners, described the benefits to the agency:\n\n> “Welcoming the Animal Foundation to R&R Vegas’ list of clients was a great way to boost morale within the agency.

Chronically underfunded, the agency was having difficulty providing care in a timely manner. At various locations around the country, veterans were put on lengthy wait lists before they could receive care.\n\nTurning to a common private sector solution in an attempt to reduce wait times, the VA provided bonuses to administrators who could reduce veterans’ wait times for doctor and hospital appointments. While these incentives were meant to spur more efficient and productive healthcare for veterans, not all administrators complied as intended.\n\nIn one hospital, the goal was to reduce wait times to less than 14 days. Clerks would record a wait time of how many days there would be between the first available appointment date and the veteran’s scheduled appointment date, disregarding any days prior to the first available date. In an email to colleagues, the clerk admitted, “Yes, it is gaming the system a bit. But you have to know the rules of the game you are playing, and when we exceed the 14-day measure, the front office gets very upset.”\n\nAt some locations, veterans were put on an electronic waiting list. After waiting for up to six weeks to move to the top of that list, they were finally able to call for a doctor’s appointment. If that appointment occurred soon after the call, it was counted as reducing the wait time; the time spent on the preliminary electronic waiting list was not counted. At other locations, VA officials used two sets of books, one recording the real wait times and another recording much shorter wait times that would be used to report success to superiors.\n\nUsing these and other maneuvers, executives in the VA qualified for millions of dollars of bonuses, even though actual wait times continued to lengthen.

Jewish men, women, and children were murdered near their homes in surrounding fields and forests by German police forces and their local helpers. Historians estimate that these so-called mobile killing units shot almost 2 million people during World War II. After the war, when some of the shooters and their commanders were put on trial, they claimed that they had to follow orders. Decades later, however, historians studying the interrogation files of one of these police battalions made a startling discovery. Not only did many ordinary Germans participate in the mass murder of Jews, they did so voluntarily.\n\nIn his book on one group of reserve policemen from the German city Hamburg, Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland, historian Christopher Browning shows that while the men were expected to follow orders when it came to killing civilians, they could have refused to do so. In July 1942, before their induction into the mass shooting of civilians in the small Polish town of Józefów, their commander gave battalion members a choice. If any of the men were “not up to the task,” they would be assigned to do “other duties,” such as guarding or transportation. When given the opportunity to opt out, only a very small number of men did. Even though this option remained in the months that followed, the majority of reserve policemen chose to kill—to do the “dirty work” even if just for a short time before being relieved of duty—rather than separate themselves from their unit by refusing to murder civilians.\n\nMost of these ordinary, middle-aged German men became willing, although not enthusiastic, killers. A small minority consistently excused themselves from the task at hand. Browning argues that those who killed, did so because of:\n\n“[T]he pressure for conformity—the basic identification of men in uniform with their comrades and the strong urge not to separate themselves from the group by stepping out… [The] act of stepping out…meant leaving one’s comrades and admitting that one was ‘too weak’ or ‘cowardly’.”\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this scenario, I would focus on the importance of individual agency and moral responsibility.

It features high-speed collisions between human beings, at least one of whom is often very large. Broken bones, torn ligaments, and even occasional paralysis can result. But it is the research on brain injuries that has caused many people to claim football is immoral and to advocate that it be banned. Such calls have gained the attention and opposition of the National Football League (NFL) given the high popularity and profitability of football as a spectator sport.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as “a disruption in the normal function of the brain that can be caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head, or penetrating head injury.” A concussion is a form of TBI where the blow causes the brain to move rapidly back and forth, bouncing around in the skull and suffering various types of structural damage. Although concussions can carry serious consequences, they are termed a “mild” form of TBI because they are not typically life-threatening. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), says the Mayo Clinic, is “brain degeneration likely caused by repeated head traumas.” Repetitive head impacts (RHIs) can cumulatively lead to CTE and early death, even though no single RHI results in a concussion.\n\nIf only one thing is clear about the current science surrounding sports-related concussions (SRCs) and their related brain injuries, it’s that very little is certain about the current science. The field is surprisingly new. A significant scientific breakthrough occurred in 2002 when an African-American neuropathologist in Pittsburgh named Bennet Omalu (played by Will Smith in the 2015 movie Concussion) performed an autopsy on Hall of Fame center Mike Webster. Dr. Omalu identified abnormal clumps of the protein tau in Webster’s brain, which he believed to be evidence of CTE. Such proteins develop in tangles that slowly strangle neurons and, consequently, inhibit brain function.\n\nMany studies point to how dangerous football is to players’ long-term brain health. Although there is also research related to college players and younger, this case study focuses on the NFL. The studies show:\n\n- Over two regular seasons (2012-2014), NFL players sustained 4,384 injuries, including 301 concussions. This statistic is up 61% from 2002-2007, perhaps reflecting an improvement of awareness and reporting (Lawrence et al. 2015).\n\n- In a study of 14,000 NFL players, researchers found that even head impacts insufficient to cause concussions can mount up over the years, leading to CTE and premature death. An NFL player who plays 24 games increases the likelihood of premature death by 16% (Ehrlich et al., 2019).\n\n- A 2019 study of the brains of 223 football players with CTE and 43 players without CTE found that for each additional 2.6 years of play, the risk of developing CTE doubled (Mex et al. 2019).\n\nGiven the results of these studies, there has been a strong outcry against football, including at the NFL level. The NFL initially pushed back against the implications of such research. Then, as evidence piled up, the NFL funded research itself about head injuries and also how to design safer equipment. And, the NFL made rule changes in an attempt to make the game safer. The NFL has also changed rules to discourage helmet-to-helmet contact, and instituted protocols for safely returning concussed players to the field.\n\nDespite these changes, controversy continues because the science in this area is not settled. Importantly, standard medical imaging techniques do not show brain damage even when a player has had a concussion. And CTE cannot truly be diagnosed until the brain is examined after death.\n\nNeuropsychologist Munro Cullum argues: “I worry the pendulum has swung too far. The reality is that we still don’t know who is most likely to suffer a concussion, who will take longer to recover, how anatomic or genetic differences influence concussions, and who may be at risk of prolonged symptoms or developing cognitive problems later in life.”\n\nSome studies seem to indicate that concussions may be more benign than feared. For example:\n\n- A 2016 study found no elevated risk of suicide in a population of players with at least five years in the league (Lehman et al., 2016).\n\n- Another study of 35 former NFL players over age 50 who had sustained multiple concussions during their careers found no significant association between the length of careers, the number of concussions, and their level of cognitive function later in life (Mez et al., 2019).\n\n- A 2007 study found that retired NFL players experienced levels of depressive symptoms no worse than those of the general population (Schwenk, 2007).\n\nSo, at the end of the day, the jury still seems to be out on the question of whether or not we can go to a football game or watch one on television and still feel good about ourselves for supporting a sport that arguably causes irreversible traumatic brain injuries.

These researchers concluded “either the vaccine failed to protect the elderly against mortality… and/or the vaccination efforts did not adequately target the frailest elderly.”\n\nMore recent research has tried to develop a method to assess in advance whether a given flu vaccine would have any protection benefit. A report published in 2016 in the journal Nature Immunology used a blood assay and identified a correlation between persons with a certain pattern of gene expression and the likelihood that such persons would experience adverse events after receiving a flu vaccine. If this assay could be made economical, and included in blood tests typically done in annual physicals, it could reduce the number of suits filed with the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. With these reports in mind, consider the following case:\n\nDr. Jones works in a hospital and she recently became aware of all the above reports. She belongs to the American Medical Association (AMA), which strongly recommends that everyone receive flu shots each year. Moreover, her hospital recently informed her that she herself must take annual flu shots or risk termination of her hospital privileges or employment. Dr. Jones, however, is aware of the AMA Code of Ethics, which states that patients have a right of self-decision regarding their health care, and that this right can only be effectively exercised “if the patient possesses enough information to enable an informed choice.” She feels a moral obligation to inform her senior patients that she has reservations about the efficacy of flu shots for their age group and why.\n\nSince the AMA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are strong proponents of annual flu shots, if Dr. Jones gives contrary advice to her patients, this could jeopardize her standing with the AMA, in addition to her employment at her hospital. Furthermore, her hospital administrator and other health officials are concerned that if doctors advise patients about the relative ineffectiveness of, and potential injury from, flu vaccines, this could feed public doubts about the efficacy or safety of other vaccines. Such doubts could increase public opposition to new state laws that aim to promote “herd immunity” by mandating certain vaccinations.\n\nWhile the case of Dr. Jones is based on the actual experiences of a medical doctor, her name and identifying details have been changed. This case study reflects the key ethical dilemmas the doctor faced. "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would advise Dr. Jones to carefully consider the potential consequences of her actions before deciding how to proceed. She could start by reviewing the specific research studies mentioned in the scenario to better understand the evidence behind the effectiveness of flu shots, especially for the elderly population. Dr. Jones could also consult with colleagues or mentors within the medical community to get their perspectives on the situation.\n\nIf Dr. Jones decides to inform her senior patients about her reservations regarding the efficacy of flu shots for their age group, she should do so in a respectful and non-confrontational manner. She could consider presenting the information as part of a broader discussion about preventive health measures and the importance of informed decision-making in healthcare. Dr. Jones should be prepared to answer any questions her patients may have and provide them with resources for further reading or research.\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Jones may want to document her concerns and the reasons behind her decision to share this information with her patients. Keeping a record of her actions and the rationale behind them could help protect her in case of any potential backlash from the hospital administration or professional organizations.\n\nUltimately, Dr. Jones should prioritize the well-being and autonomy of her patients while also being mindful of the potential professional and personal consequences of her actions. It is important for her to act in a way that aligns with her ethical beliefs and values, while also considering the broader implications of her choices within the medical community."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is the answer ethical?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer provided is practical and specific in advising Dr. Jones to carefully consider the consequences of her actions before informing her senior patients about her reservations regarding flu shots.

Under NCLB, every child in the U.S. must achieve proficiency in reading and math. While each state can determine its own level of proficiency, a child’s ability to advance to the next grade level, and even graduate from high school, hinges on passing a standardized test. Across the U.S., children in minority communities have been more likely not to receive a diploma due to low-test scores on mandated exams.\n\nAssessment has many benefits. Advocates of large-scale assessments claim that it is an objective and fair measure of student achievement. Results show how students, or groups of students, measure up against one another and broader standards. Ideally, all children throughout the country will receive an equal education, and testing can help educators target where instructional improvements are necessary. Sonja Brookins Santelises, Vice President of K-12 Policy and Practice for the Education Trust, acknowledges that there is too much rote test preparation, but argues that we must work together to reduce the achievement gap among student populations. The founder of nonprofit organization StudentsFirst and former Chancellor of D.C. Public Schools, Michelle Rhee, also sees standardized testing as a means to reduce this gap. She states:\n\n> “It’s not inconceivable for a student to be receiving all A’s and B’s on her report card but still be stuck far behind her peers in other districts and states across the country. And without standardized testing, that child’s parents, teachers and principal would have no idea.”\n\nOpponents, however, firmly believe that high stakes testing is problematic and even ruinous to our educational system. There is no research to corroborate that standardized testing, a multi-billion dollar industry controlled by three large U.S. corporations, is effective. Teachers complain that they are forced to “teach to the test,” leaving little or no time for subjects that are not tested, such as art, social studies, and science. Parent and former teacher Edy Chamness founded a Facebook group in 2011 to rally parents in her community to protest against school accountability and standardized testing requirements. She also kept her son out of school on testing days. Other parents, including Maeve Siano of Celina, Texas, similarly felt that the preparation and stress associated with testing were more likely to damage her son than help him. Celina Superintendent Donny O’Dell stated:\n\n> “Our country was basically founded on rebellion, so to speak.

Military analyst Daniel Ellsberg leaked the “Pentagon Papers,” which contained sensitive information regarding the United States’ progress in the Vietnam War. President Nixon himself tasked Krogh with stopping leaks of top-secret information. And Nixon’s Assistant for Domestic Affairs, John Ehrlichman, instructed Krogh to investigate and discredit Ellsberg, telling Krogh that the leak was damaging to national security.\n\nKrogh and another staffer assembled a covert team that became known as the “plumbers” (to stop leaks), which was broadly supervised by Ehrlichman. In September 1971, the plumbers’ first break-in was at the office of Ellsberg’s psychiatrist; they were looking for documents that would discredit Ellsberg based on mental health. Reflecting on the meeting in which the break-in was proposed and approved, Krogh later wrote:\n\n“I listened intently. At no time did I or anyone else there question whether the operation was necessary, legal or moral. Convinced that we were responding legitimately to a national security crisis, we focused instead on the operational details: who would do what, when and where.”\n\nThe break-in, which was illegal, was also unproductive. Nothing was found to discredit Ellsberg. Importantly, the ties between this break-in and Nixon were much more direct and easy to establish than the ties between Nixon and the Watergate break-in. Krogh later pled guilty to his role in the break-in and was sentenced to two-to-six years in prison. At his sentencing, Krogh explained that national security is “subject to a wide range of definitions, a factor that makes all the more essential a painstaking approach to the definition of national security in any given instance.” Judge Gesell, sentencing Krogh to serve six months in prison and remain on unsupervised probation for another two years, said:\n\n“In acknowledging your guilt, you have made no effort, as you very well might have, to place the primary blame on others who initiated and who approved the undertaking. A wholly improper, illegal task was assigned to you by higher authority and you carried it out because of a combination of loyalty and I believe a degree of vanity, thereby compromising your obligations as a lawyer and a public servant.”\n\nKrogh, who cooperated with the Watergate prosecutors and never bargained for leniency, served only four-and-a-half months of his sentence. The Washington State Supreme Court disbarred Krogh in 1975, although he successfully petitioned to be reinstated in 1980 and became partner in the Seattle law firm Krogh & Leonard. Krogh has spent much of the past 45 years supporting legal ethics education and writing and lecturing on the topic of integrity. Writing for The New York Times in 2007, he stated:\n\n“I finally realized that what had gone wrong in the Nixon White House was a meltdown in personal integrity.

Political commentator and talk show host Rush Limbaugh has become well known for his outspoken opinions on a number of political and social issues, including drug abuse.\n\nDuring his talk show on October 5, 1995, Limbaugh stated:\n\n“There’s nothing good about drug use. We know it. It destroys individuals. It destroys families. Drug use destroys societies. Drug use, some might say, is destroying this country.

Nelson and Robinson were entrepreneurs and were going to discuss business investment opportunities with Yaffe, a white real estate developer. As they waited, an employee asked if she could help them. They said “no,” that they were just waiting for a business meeting. Then a manager told Nelson that he couldn’t use the restroom because he was not a paying customer.\n\nBecause the two men had not purchased anything yet, a store manager called police, even though Robinson had been a customer at the store for almost a decade and both men had used the store location for business meetings before. At least six Philadelphia Police Department officers arrived. The police officers did not ask the men any questions; they just demanded that they leave immediately. They declined.

Does anyone else think this is ridiculous? It’s absolute discrimination.”\n\nThe two men were taken out in handcuffs. They were taken to the police station, photographed, and fingerprinted. They were held for almost nine hours before being released from custody.

In the musical, Kim is forced to work at ‘Dreamland,’ a seedy bar owned by the half-French, half-Vietnamese character ‘the Engineer.’ The production was highly anticipated, generating millions of dollars in ticket sales before it had even opened.\n\nControversy erupted and debate ensued about ethical representation in the performing arts, however, when producers revealed that Jonathan Pryce, a white British actor, would reprise his role as the Eurasian ‘Engineer.’ Asian American actor B.D. Wong argued that by casting a white actor in a role written for an Asian actor, the production supported the practice of “yellow-face.” Similar to “blackface” minstrel shows of the 19th and 20th centuries, “yellow-face” productions cast non-Asians in roles written for Asians, often relying on physical and cultural stereotypes to make broad comments about identity. Wong asked his union, Actors’ Equity Association, to “force Cameron Mackintosh and future producers to cast their productions with racial authenticity.”\n\nActors’ Equity Association initially agreed and refused to let Pryce perform:\n\n“Equity believes the casting of Mr. Pryce as a Eurasian to be especially insensitive and an affront to the Asian community.”\n\nMoreover, many argued that the casting of Pryce further limited already scarce professional opportunities for Asian American actors.

Many miners, including children, work under hazardous conditions without adequate safety measures. The lack of regulation and oversight has led to exploitative labor practices and environmental degradation.\n\nFor paleontologists and collectors, acquiring these amber fossils presents a moral quandary. While the specimens offer unparalleled scientific value, purchasing them may inadvertently support conflict and exploitation. Some scientists argue that studying these fossils is essential for advancing knowledge, while others advocate for a boycott to avoid contributing to the ongoing strife.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by the international demand for amber fossils, which drives up prices and incentivizes continued mining under unethical conditions. Efforts to establish ethical sourcing guidelines and promote responsible practices have been proposed, but enforcement remains challenging in a region with limited governance and oversight.\n\nIn summary, the discovery of Myanmar's amber fossils has opened new windows into the ancient past but has also highlighted the complex interplay between scientific pursuit and ethical responsibility.

In 1994, Lederman asked Gellene to represent mining equipment company Bucyrus-Erie (BE) in a reorganization bankruptcy that became increasingly complicated.\n\nIn an attempt to initially ward off bankruptcy, BE had, pursuant to the legal advice of Milbank Tweed and the financial advice of Goldman Sachs, accepted a $35 million infusion of cash from an investment fund called South Street. In exchange, BE gave South Street a lien on all of the company’s manufacturing equipment, putting it ahead of other BE creditors, including Jackson National Life (JNL). JNL was BE’s largest single creditor, but was unsecured. BE had posted no collateral in return for JNL’s loan, so JNL was in line in bankruptcy court behind all of BE’s creditors that had demanded collateral. South Street was controlled by Mikael Salovaara, a former Goldman Sachs banker who had previously provided financial advice to BE and was advised by Lederman.\n\nWhen Gellene filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on behalf of BE, he was required to ask the court to appoint him and Milbank Tweed as BE’s counsel for purposes of the proceedings. At that time, he filed documents under oath that were supposed to disclose any potential conflicts of interest that Milbank Tweed had in the proceedings. For reasons unknown, Gellene did not disclose to the bankruptcy judge (who would appoint counsel) the fact that Milbank Tweed was representing both South Street and Salovaara regarding various matters.\n\nLegal scholars and attorneys reflecting on this case years later have speculated as to why Gellene did not disclose what might seem to be obvious connections that could be potential conflicts of interest for Milbank Tweed. Lawyer Steve Sather suggests that the lack of disclosure may have been inadvertent, or that Gellene did not see the connections as inherent conflicts, among other possible reasons.\n\nRegardless, Gellene did successfully guide BE through the reorganization process. The failure to disclose was not discovered until years later by JNL, which then sued Milbank Tweed.

Pao began working at Kleiner Perkins in 2005. She became a junior investing partner, but after several years at the firm was passed over for a senior partner position and was eventually terminated. Pao claimed that men with similar profiles and achievements were promoted instead.\n\nIn late 2011, Pao and a coworker were asked by a senior partner to come up with ways of improving the firm’s treatment of women, but the senior partner, according to Pao, was “noncommittal.” On January 4, 2012, Pao took this issue a step further and wrote a formal memorandum to several of her superiors and the firm’s outside counsel. In the memorandum, she described harassment she had received while at the firm, claiming she had been excluded from meetings by male partners, and asserting an absence of training and policies to prevent discrimination at the firm. Pao’s memo indicated that she wished to work with the firm on improving conditions for women. She was fired on October 1, 2012. The lawsuit went to trial in February 2015.\n\nIn a testimony during the trial, Pao explained that she sued because there was no process for HR issues at the firm and believed she had exhausted all options for addressing these issues internally:\n\n> “It’s been a long journey, and I’ve tried many times to bring Kleiner Perkins to the right path. I think there should be equal opportunities for women and men to be venture capitalists. I wanted to be a VC but I wasn’t able to do so in that environment. And I think it’s important…to make those opportunities available in the future. And I wanted to make sure my story was told.”\n\nPao’s lawsuit made four claims against Kleiner Perkins:\n\n1. They discriminated against Pao on the basis of gender by failing to promote her and/or terminating her employment.\n\n2. They retaliated by failing to promote her because of conversations she had in late 2011 and/or the memo from January 4, 2012.\n\n3. They failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent gender discrimination against her.\n\n4. They retaliated against her by terminating her employment because of conversations she had in late 2011 and/or the memo from January 4, 2012.\n\nPao’s legal team argued that men were promoted ahead of women, women who experienced sexual harassment received little support, and women’s ideas were often more quickly dismissed than men’s. Pao’s performance reviews revealed contradictory criticisms such as “too bold” and “too quiet.” Pao also accused company partner Ajit Nazre of pressuring her into an affair and subsequently retaliating against her after she ended the relationship. She said she received an inappropriate gift containing erotic imagery and was present while men at the firm were making inappropriate conversation. Further, the legal team described how Pao and other women had been left out of certain meetings and gatherings.\n\nThe defense’s case focused on Pao’s performance and character, noting that Pao received several negative performance reviews and acted entitled or resentful toward other employees and was not a team player. Evidence included evaluations, self-evaluations, meeting summaries, and messages both personal and professional. Kleiner Perkins claimed that Pao was paid more than her male counterparts, including bonuses and training. The firm also argued that Pao’s job description was mostly managerial and that limiting her involvement in investing was therefore not a form of discrimination.\n\nThe verdict was announced on March 27, 2015. The jury ruled 10 to 2 in favor of Kleiner Perkins on the first three claims, and 8 to 4 in favor of Kleiner Perkins on the fourth claim. Speaking after the trial, juror Steve Sammut said that the verdict came down to performance reviews, in which Pao’s negative criticism remained consistent each year. But he added that he wished there was some way for Kleiner Perkins to be punished for its treatment of employees, “It isn’t good. It’s like the wild, wild West.” Juror Marshalette Ramsey voted in favor of Pao, believing Pao had been discriminated against. Ramsey stated that the male junior partners who were promoted “had those same character flaws that Ellen was cited with.”\n\nDeborah Rhode, law professor at Stanford University, said that even with this loss, Pao’s lawsuit succeeded in prompting debate about women in venture capital and tech. She stated, “This case sends a powerful signal to Silicon Valley in general and the venture capital industry in particular… Defendants who win in court sometimes lose in the world outside it.” After the verdict was announced, Pao stated that she hoped the case at least helped level the playing field for women and minorities in venture capital. She later wrote:\n\n> “I have a request for all companies: Please don’t try to silence employees who raise discrimination and harassment concerns. …I hope future cases prove me wrong and show that our community and our jurists have now developed a better understanding of how discrimination works in real life, in the tech world, in the press and in the courts.”\n\nPao’s case has since been credited for inspiring others facing workplace discrimination to act; similar lawsuits have been filed against companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft.

On August 15, 1974, he was admitted to Bethesda Naval Hospital and diagnosed with viral pneumonia. One account suggests he was admitted with a recurrence of phlebitis. Nixon had a history of phlebitis, which can be fatal even if treated.\n\nOn September 8, 1974, President Ford issued a full and absolute pardon of Nixon for all offenses against the United States, making Nixon immune from any arrest, investigation, or imprisonment from his involvement in Watergate.

All parties denied any such deal and no evidence in support of these allegations ever surfaced.\n\nWith the Watergate scandal consuming the nation, Ford signaled that he wanted to refocus the public and rebuild trust in the executive branch. He sought to move forward by concentrating on the nation’s problems, such as ending the Vietnam War, rather than spending his entire administration dissecting the activities of the previous president for years to come. However, as a result of the pardon, Nixon would never be held accountable for activity widely thought to be criminal.\n\nPresident Ford also believed from reports and advisors that Nixon’s health was seriously compromised and that his death was likely imminent.

Society of New York Hospitals* (1914), when he wrote, “Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body.” This case established the principle of informed consent and has become central to modern medical practice ethics. However, a number of events since 1914 have illustrated how the autonomy of patients may be overridden. In *Buck v. Bell* (1927), Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that the involuntary sterilization of “mental defectives,” then a widespread practice in the U.S., was justified, stating, “Three generations of imbeciles are enough.” Another example, the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, in which African-American males were denied life-saving treatment for syphilis as part of a scientific study of the natural course of the disease, began in 1932 and was not stopped until 1972.\n\nProviding advice related to topics of bioethics, the President’s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research stated:\n\n> “Informed consent is rooted in the fundamental recognition—reflected in the legal presumption of competency—that adults are entitled to accept or reject health care interventions on the basis of their own personal values and in furtherance of their own personal goals.”\n\nBut what of circumstances where patients are deemed incompetent through judicial proceedings, and where someone else is designated to make decisions on behalf of a mentally incompetent individual?\n\nConsider the following case:\n\nA middle-aged man was involuntarily committed to a state psychiatric hospital because he was considered dangerous to others due to severe paranoid thinking. His violent behavior was controlled only by injectable medications, which were initially administered against his will. He had been declared mentally incompetent, and the decisions to approve the use of psychotropic medications were made by his adult son who had been awarded guardianship and who held medical power of attorney.\n\nWhile the medications suppressed the patient’s violent agitation, they made little impact on his paranoid symptoms. His chances of being able to return to his home community appeared remote. However, a new drug was introduced into the hospital formulary which, if used with this patient, offered the strong possibility that he could return home. The drug, however, was only available in a pill form, and the patient’s paranoia included fears that others would try to poison him. The suggestion was made to grind up the pill and surreptitiously administer the drug by mixing it in pudding.\n\nHospital staff checked with the patient’s son and obtained informed consent from him. The “personal values and…personal goals” of the son and other family members were seen to substitute for those of the mentally incompetent patient—and these goals included the desire for the patient to live outside of an institution and close to loved ones in the community.

Among the most debated of bioethical issues is the issue of abortion, which hinges on whether the fetus is a person with rights, notably the right to life.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court recognized a limited Constitutional right for a woman to choose an abortion in Roe v. Wade in 1973, only to eliminate that right nearly 50 years later in Dobbs v. Jackson’s Women’s Health Organization in 2022. The Dobbs decision places abortion rule-making in the hands of the U.S. Congress, which seems unlikely to reach a consensus any time soon, and the state legislatures, which are widely split on abortion issues. For example, in the first half of 2022, 11 states passed laws to protect or expand abortion care and 12 states enacted restrictions. In the first citizen vote after Dobbs, Kansans voted to retain a right to abortion.\n\nAs legislatures around the country continue to debate the scope of permissible abortions, it is clear that much attention will be paid to the issue of prenatal medical testing. At least two-thirds of diagnoses of Down syndrome lead to a decision to abort where that is permitted. Many states permit abortions where prenatal testing has revealed genetic testing abnormalities in fetuses, but several states have specifically prohibited abortions performed for the purpose of avoiding giving birth to a baby with Down syndrome.\n\nIn early 2023, more than 40 pro-life organizations wrote every Republican member of Congress to urge enactment of pro-life laws that would, among other things, prohibit abortions based solely on a diagnosis of Down Syndrome (the “Protecting Individuals with Down Syndrome Act”).\n\nThose who oppose prenatal testing bans on abortion argue that laws based on intention or motivation to terminate a pregnancy would be unenforceable. “This is interference with a medical decision following a complicated diagnosis,” according to Kellie Copeland, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, “Not knowing the family and the circumstances, the legislature can’t possibly take into account all the factors involved.”\n\nSupporters of the “Protecting Individuals with Down Syndrome Act” have described this as a way to limit the number of abortions and protect babies born with disabilities. Mike Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life, stated, “We all want to be born perfect, but none of us are, and everyone has a right to live, perfect or not.”\n\nIn November 2022, the Court of Appeal in Britain ruled that the country’s Abortion Act that allows abortion up until birth for a fetus with Down Syndrome was legal and did not interfere with the rights of the living disabled.

The number of minors apprehended as they tried to enter the U.S. nearly doubled over the previous year from 35,200 to 66,120. The fastest growing segment of child migrants were those under 12 years old, increasing concern that vulnerable children were risking their lives on a dangerous journey to the U.S. to escape violence and poverty in their home countries. The influx posed a number of logistical and ethical dilemmas for state and federal authorities, and overwhelmed the capacity of authorities to process new migrants or even provide shelter for them.\n\nThe Obama administration responded with a multifaceted plan that included millions of dollars of emergency funding. The plan called for increased border enforcement, deportation of those deemed economic migrants, more detention facilities, additional immigration judges to process claims for political asylum as refugees, and new programs in countries of origin that would mitigate violence and economic hardship for minors as well as discourage or intercept migrants before reaching the U.S. Because facilities at the border were being overrun, the government also transported some migrants to other parts of the country. This drew protests from local communities that tried to turn back buses filled with migrant children. The administration’s response drew criticism from all quarters.\n\nHuman rights and refugee advocates, as well as many religious institutions, argued that the U.S. was neglecting its moral obligation to protect innocent and vulnerable children, many of whom were fleeing violence at the hands of criminal gangs and the drug trade. According to journalist Sonia Nazario, the influx of minors was not a crisis of illegal immigration but rather a refugee crisis: the violence in countries, such as Honduras, was prompting youths to flee their homes as a means of survival. Nazario argued that these refugees, similar to refugees in war-torn regions such as Syria, deserved legal and physical protection.

Chandok then sued Klessig for defamation, claiming that the retraction had significantly damaged her career and reputation within the scientific community.\n\nOver several years in court, the case highlighted various issues in scientific research and publishing. John Travis, an editor at *Science* magazine, noted the case's alignment with the National Institutes of Health's grant policy, which encourages researchers to report concerns about possible misconduct. John Dahlberg, director of the Office of Research Integrity's Division of Investigative Oversight, suggested that the case might encourage individuals to come forward without fear of being sued for defamation. Science writer Eugenie Reich described Klessig as a \"whistle-blower,\" while philosopher Janet Stemwedel raised questions about the collaborative responsibility of co-authors and Klessig regarding quality control for the research, asking, \"If credit is shared, why isn't blame?\"\n\nIn 2011, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York dismissed the case. The court ruled that Klessig's statements were legally protected because they were \"matters as to which the speaker [had] a legal or moral obligation\" to notify the journal that his laboratory could not replicate the published results. The statements were made between \"communicants who [shared] a common interest.\" The court found no proof of malice toward Chandok and noted that the investigation and attempts to have Chandok replicate her work left the question of scientific misconduct open.

The mill had  originally  been\nlocated on this site in order to use  water  power  as  the  primary  energy\nsource for running the  mill  equipment  through  a  vast  array  of  belts,\npulleys  and  reduction  gears.   However,  because  of  the  site  location\nadjacent to the river, the  soils  tended  to  be  loose  and/or  moderately\ncompressible,  requiring  deep  foundations  for  heavier  portions  of  the\nstructures.\n\nOne of the most prominent mill structures was the original tower  which  was\nin excess of 15 stories in height, and over the years the  large  clocks  on\nall four sides of the tower became the standard reference for  correct  time\nin the local community, even after the mill became defunct and lay idle  for\nmore than 35 years.  Recently however, the region has realized an  increased\ngrowth due to a demand for computer  software  development  for  industrial,\nmedical and personal uses.  MegaBite Unlimited, a nationally known  computer\nsoftware development firm, surveyed a number  of  sites  in  the  state  and\ndecided that because of the semi-rural atmosphere of the  town,  the  above-\naverage educational background of most of the residents and  the  attractive\ntax incentives offered by the local improvement  board,  they  would  design\nand build a new corporate facility in the town.\n\nThe prime site for the new facility was the abandoned mill and clock  tower.\n Since the mill buildings had been left without maintenance for such a  long\nperiod, it was decided to demolish them and build  an  efficiently  designed\ncomplex of structures which would  complement  the  colonial  decor  of  the\narea.  The local planning  commission  concurred  with  this  decision,  but\ninsisted that the original 15-plus  story  clock  tower  be  retained  as  a\nsymbol of the prosperity the town once enjoyed,  and  would  now  experience\nagain.\n\nDuring the design  of  the  new  facility,  MegaBite  Unlimited’s  architect\nretained I. B. Stout, a structural engineer from a nearby city,  to  do  the\nstructural engineering and design such systems as might be necessary  during\ndemolition of the old structures in order to protect the  old  clock  tower,\nif necessary.  Stout’s review of  the  available  records  showed  that  the\nheavy clock tower was supported on a 48-foot square mat at a depth of  about\n18 feet below ground surface, and the mat in turn was  supported  on  wooden\npiles driven to some depth below the  water  table  to  pick  up  additional\nsupport in the underlying soils.  Based on this information, Stout  designed\na shallow retaining system for support of the sides of the excavation  which\nwould occur during demolition of the adjacent mill  buildings  approximately\n50 feet away.\n\nThe plans and specifications for the demolition were completed,  along  with\nthe  design  documents  for  the  proposed  new  facility,   advertised   to\ncontractors for bid, and the job was let to Colonial  Construction  Company,\na general construction contractor in business for more than 60 years in  the\nlocal  area.   Since  Colonial  had  the  necessary  heavy  equipment,  they\nproceeded with the demolition work  as  one  of  the  first  stages  of  the\nproject.  About  the  time  that  the  demolition  excavation  had  come  to\napproximately 100 feet from the old clock tower,  one  of  the  construction\ncrew noted that the tower seemed a bit out of plumb, but thought  little  of\nit, since the tower was so  old.   However,  as  the  excavation  progressed\ncloser to the tower, it became apparent that the tower  was  tilting  at  an\nincreasing rate, and toward the demolition excavation.\nColonial stopped work over a weekend to consider what steps, if any,  should\nbe taken with regard to the clock tower.  Upon  returning  to  the  site  on\nMonday morning, new survey measurements indicated that the tilt at  the  top\nof the tower had increased to six inches.  At that point Colonial called  W.\nE. Holdem, Inc., a specialty ground modification  subcontractor,  and  asked\nfor their assistance in correcting the  situation  so  that  the  demolition\ncould  be  completed  to  the  extent  originally  planned.   Realizing  the\nseriousness of the problem, Holdem in turn called  in  Jonathan  Turnbuckle,\nan engineering consultant in the Midwest who  had  an  excellent  reputation\nfor coming up with  innovative,  cost-effective  solutions  to  construction\nproblems requiring ground modification.  Holdem knew of  Turnbuckle  because\nthey had worked together on a number  of  projects  over  the  past  several\nyears in other areas of the country.\n\nTurnbuckle was quick to respond; visited the  site;  assessed  the  problem;\ndevised a solution with a reasonable chance of success; conferred  with  the\narchitect, I. B. Stout, the architect’s  geotechnical  engineer,  MegaBite’s\nrepresentatives and  the  town’s  building  officials  and  the  mayor,  and\nexplained the solution.  He also made  recommendations  for  standby  cranes\nand other safety precautions should it not  be  possible  to  implement  the\nproposed ground modification scheme in time to  save  the  clock  tower  and\navert potential property damage and possible personal injury.\n\nThe  entire  group  cooperated  in  expediting  the  standby  equipment  and\nprocedures. Holdem mobilized on the site within two days and  initiated  the\nremediation procedure devised by  Turnbuckle,  successfully  continuing  the\nprocess and averting the collapse of the clock tower.  It took a  period  of\nabout 70 days to continue the process  until  the  adjacent  demolition  was\ncompleted and the excavation backfilled, with  constant  monitoring  on  the\nsite and analyses being required for at least the first 45  days.   No  one,\nincluding I. B. Stout whose original  design  had  allowed  the  problem  to\noccur, was sued.\n\nAbout three weeks or so after the remediation  procedure  was  initiated  by\nHoldem, Inc., Jonathan Turnbuckle realized that since the  solution  he  had\ndevised was an engineering design, he should have permission to practice  in\nthe state, if only for a temporary period.  He then  contacted  the  state’s\nBoard of Registration for Engineers and Surveyors,  requesting  a  temporary\nengineering license.  He was told by the Board that although many states  do\nhave a provision for such a temporary or  short-term  permit  for  engineers\nlicensed in other states, this particular state had no  such  provision  and\nhe would have to make a full,  formal  application  for  registration  as  a\nprofessional engineer in the state.\n\nTurnbuckle  obtained  the  necessary  forms,  filled  them  out   (including\nreferences to the professional  engineering  registrations  he  held  in  17\nother states), and turned them in to the Board  within  a  couple  of  days.\nApproximately  three  months  after  the  remedial  construction  had   been\ncompleted and the clock tower saved, he received notice  of  his  acceptance\nby the Board as a registered professional engineer  by  reciprocity.   Since\nthe project was complete as far as Turnbuckle  and  Holdem  were  concerned,\nthey each went on to other projects in other areas.\n\nRecently, Turnbuckle has received a registered letter from the  state  Board\nof Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors notifying  him\nthat I. B. Stout, the structural engineer  for  the  MegaBite  project,  has\nfiled a formal complaint against him for practicing as  an  engineer  during\nthe time of the clock  tower  incident  without  a  license  in  the  state.\nFurthermore, Turnbuckle is advised that  Stout  is  prepared  to  carry  the\nmatter to court, where Stout intends to sue  Turnbuckle  for  a  substantial\nsum of money, claiming that too many out-of-state engineers do  designs  for\nprojects within the state without  being  licensed,  and  that  practice  is\nfinancially detrimental to Stout and the survival of his practice.\n\nIs Turnbuckle at fault for not having a professional engineer’s  license  in\nthe  state  during  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  clock   tower\nremediation?  What should he do, or have done?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would advise Turnbuckle to gather all the necessary documentation related to his work on the clock tower remediation project, including his engineering designs, correspondence with the various parties involved, and any relevant permits or licenses he held in other states.

B. Stout with a detailed explanation of his qualifications, experience, and the circumstances surrounding his involvement in the project. He should provide evidence of his professional engineering registrations in other states and demonstrate that he acted in good faith to address the structural issues with the clock tower.\n\nAdditionally, Turnbuckle should cooperate fully with the state Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors, providing any additional information or documentation they may require to review his case.

His wife, Karla, also started her career  in  financial\ncomputing systems about the same time.  Ralph was  a  diligent  worker,  and\nhandled  most  of  the  projects  to  which  he  was  assigned  efficiently,\nproducing technically excellent reports and designs.  As a result,  by  1991\nhe advanced to a project manager position in the firm and was considered  to\nbe one of the office’s most valuable  employees  by  the  firm’s  president,\nDirk Wheeler.\n\nIn 1994, Ralph’s wife, Karla, decided that  her  career  had  stagnated  and\nafter searching around, found a much more attractive position paying  almost\ntwice her present salary in Omaha, Nebraska.  She accepted the position  and\nRalph was forced to make a career move himself if  he  planned  to  preserve\ntheir marriage. Since his firm  did  not  have  an  office  near  Omaha,  he\napproached his manager and together they  made  a  proposal  to  the  firm’s\npresident, Dirk Wheeler, to open  a  small  branch  office  in  Omaha  under\nRalph’s management.  The proposal was accepted and the Omaha branch was  set\nup.  By 1996 that office had 18 employees, including 10 engineers, two  CADD\noperators, three technicians, a  secretary/receptionist,  a  bookkeeper  and\nRalph, who was the principal engineer and branch manager.\n\nThe business was reasonably  profitable  and  Ralph  had  attracted  several\nsubstantial clients.   In  addition,  the  work  forecast  for  the  future,\nestimated to be on the order of $1.3 million,  looked  most  promising.   At\nthat point Ralph was approached by  Dirk  Wheeler,  who  had  been  suddenly\nfired by the Gamma Group in 1995 for attempting to sell the  entire  company\nto an entrepreneurial conglomerate without the consent of the stockholders.\n\nWheeler had subsequently become involved with Compass Associates, a  general\nengineering company with several offices in the mid-section of the  country,\nbut not in Omaha.  Compass was interested  in  having  an  office  in  Omaha\ncapable of providing the same type of specialized  engineering  services  as\nRalph’s Gamma Group office.  Dirk Wheeler was interested in  the  same  goal\nso that he could secure a position with Compass,  and  offered  to  make  an\narrangement with Ralph to open a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Compass  in\nOmaha with Ralph as the manager and Wheeler as the subsidiary’s president.\n\nWhile Ralph was  not  sure  that  he  wanted  to  be  involved  in  such  an\narrangement, Karla pointed out that the salary and  potential  bonuses  with\nCompass would be far greater than what  he  was  receiving  from  the  Gamma\nGroup, there would be less stress on him about acquiring new business  since\nWheeler was a born salesman, and Wheeler had provided  the  opportunity  for\nthem to move to Omaha in the first place......obviously he liked  Ralph  and\nwould look out for him.  Just to make sure, Karla agreed with  Dirk  Wheeler\nthat Ralph should work part-time for Compass for two or three months to  get\nthings set up before leaving the Gamma Group.\n\nAs a result, about three months later Ralph announced to  the  personnel  in\nthe Gamma Group’s Omaha branch office at 3:00 p.m. on a Friday that  it  was\nhis last day  there,  and  wished  them  well,  telling  them  that  he  was\ntransferring to Compass Associates  to  do  the  same  kind  of  specialized\nengineering work for them.  At the same time, Dorph Klingstad,  one  of  the\nmore senior engineers in the same Gamma Group Omaha office,  announced  that\nhe also was leaving to go to work for Compass with Ralph, and they  expected\nto be working on projects for the same clients as they presently served.\n\nNeedless to say, not much more work was accomplished that day as  Ralph  and\nDorph cleaned out their offices and departed, and  the  rest  of  the  staff\nspent their time in small groups discussing this sudden turn of  events  and\nwhat was to become of each of them.  One of  the  engineers  called  Gamma’s\nmain office in Boston to see who was going to replace Ralph,  and  was  told\nthat it was the first they had heard of  Ralph  and  Dorph  leaving.   As  a\nresult, there were no specific plans at the moment, and it would be  several\ndays or more until Gamma’s management could unravel the events and plan  for\nthe future of the Omaha office.\n\nOver the weekend, Ralph’s wife, Karla, spent a substantial  amount  of  time\non the telephone talking to most of Gamma’s Omaha office employees,  telling\nthem that since Ralph and Dorph had now left,  there  would  be  no  one  to\nbring in new business, and the existing clients would most certainly  follow\nRalph to the new Compass Associates office.  She also extolled  the  virtues\nof Compass Associates, including what a good place it would be to work,  and\nsuggested pointedly that  if  they  were  interested  in  maintaining  their\nincome, they should commit to transferring to Compass Associates as well.\n\nBy the end of the following week, everyone in  the  old  Gamma  Group  Omaha\noffice except the secretary, one of the technicians  and  one  of  the  CADD\noperators had resigned and gone immediately to work for Ralph  and  Dirk  in\nthe new Compass Associates office a block down the street.\n\nIssues: (1) If you had been one of the engineers in the  Gamma  Group  Omaha\noffice, what would you have done in this situation?

Unfortunately this new project for  Wellfleet  Corporation  has  been\nhanging around the office for several  months,  since  the  project  manager\nwent on vacation alone to Fiji, then  was  sued  for  divorce  by  his  wife\nimmediately after returning.\n\nAs a result, a lot of time has been charged to the job  and  billed  to  the\nclient, but very little has been accomplished.  While the deadline  for  the\nWellfleet project is still well into the future, it  is  estimated  that  at\nleast 50% more  money  is  needed  to  complete  the  design  properly  than\nactually remains in the contract budget.   Neither  the  Excaliber  nor  the\nWellfleet project has a lump sum  contract.   Each  is  being  billed  using\nstandard hourly multiplier rates.\n\nYou and the other members  of  your  design  group  are  told  by  the  Vice\nPresident for Operations of your firm that since you are officially  working\non both projects,  the  majority  of  your  time  should  be  spent  on  the\nWellfleet project,  but  your  time  should  be  charged  to  the  Excaliber\nproject, since there is more than enough left in that budget to  finish  the\njob.

Due  to  the  business  and\nrecreational opportunities in the state, the population  has  been  steadily\nincreasing over the past 15 years, and an aggressive  building  program  was\ninitiated  at  the  university  five  years  ago  to  construct  and   equip\napproximately 16 new classroom and laboratory buildings over  the  following\n20 years.\n\nLast weekend your wife invited mutual friends,  Ted  and  Alice  Hammer,  to\nspend the weekend with you at your cottage on a lake in  the  northern  part\nof the state.

His\nwife, Alice, is an activist in  the  Placidville  community,  and  generally\nknown for her on-going campaign for integrity in government.\n\nDuring the weekend, Alice mentioned that at a recent zoning  board  meeting,\nGus Olson, one of the other board members, told her  that  the  construction\ncompany he works for as a carpenter (Shreud Contractors)  has  assigned  him\nas the construction foreman for a garage being built for  Ray  Vandergrafft.\nAlice recognized the name and knew  that  Ray  is  one  of  several  project\nmanagers for the Capital Construction Projects  Office  at  the  university.\nGus laughed and said that something as small as a wood-framed garage was  an\nunusual project for Shreud Construction, since they normally  were  involved\nin heavy steel erection projects for large structures in the region.\n\nTed interjected that he had heard Shreud Contractors recently was awarded  a\ncontract with an estimated budget of $500,000 to make  remedial  repairs  to\nthe steel superstructure of the university's  aging  football  stadium.   He\nunderstood the contract had been awarded directly to Shreud on  a  time-and-\nmaterials basis  to  avoid  the  expense  to  the  university  of  preparing\nextensive bid documents and going through a competitive  selection  process.\nHe said it was interesting that the  garage  construction  for  Vandergrafft\nwas going on at the same time as the remedial work on the stadium.\n\nIn fact, Ted said, he had learned a few years ago  that  his  own  firm  had\npreviously  been  involved  in  a  similar  situation  when  they  were  the\ncontractor for a new engineering test facility at the university and at  the\nsame time had built a large addition to Ray Vandergrafft's  kitchen  because\nhis wife, Olga, was a gourmet chef.

Your firm has established  a  reputation  for  excellent\nand accurate work among  clients  and  regulatory  agencies,  including  the\nfederal EPA and state health and ecology departments, as well.\n\nSeveral months ago, your firm was contacted by Ira Klene, the  president  of\nIndustrial  Solvents,  Ltd.   His  company  was  named,  among  others,   as\nsuspected of having moderate to severe groundwater pollution  concentrations\nbeneath his  industrial  solvent  manufacturing  plant  and  adjacent  plant\nproperty by the state regulatory agency.  In order  to  avoid  severe  fines\nand potential lengthy litigation, Mr. Klene negotiated a contract with  your\nfirm to investigate the alleged  problem,  determine  the  severity  of  the\ncondition, and prepare a report of the site  investigation  and  conclusions\nfor transmittal to the state regulatory agency,  in  compliance  with  their\nstated requirements.\n\nAs a result, you were assigned to be the  project  manager  and  coordinated\nthe installation of an array of groundwater monitoring wells, well  sampling\nand testing, analyses and preparation of the written  report.   During  your\nvisits to the site, you noted that abutting  the  Industrial  Solvent  plant\nproperty on three sides and directly across the street  were  several  other\nfirms  either  manufacturing  or  using  the  types  of  chemicals  used  by\nIndustrial Solvents.\n\nBased on the results of the  field  monitoring  and  sampling,  Ira  Klene's\ninitial claim that his company was only a minor contributor to the  problem,\nif at all, appeared to be substantiated.  Groundwater  elevation  monitoring\nin the observation wells indicated that the direction  of  groundwater  flow\nwas from west (upgradient) to east (downgradient) underneath the  Industrial\nSolvents  site.   Testing  of  samples  taken  from  the  monitoring   wells\nindicated that the concentration of toxics in the  groundwater  were  higher\nat the west side of the site, and decreased in  the  wells  further  to  the\neast on the site.\n\nYou finished putting your report together yesterday  in  preparation  for  a\npresentation  to  the  state  regulatory  agency  the  day  after  tomorrow,\naccompanied by Mr. Klene and his  in-house  corporate  legal  counsel.   The\nconclusion stated in your report is that the test results showed the  levels\nof toxics in the groundwater decrease across the site  from  west  to  east,\ntherefore the major  portion  of  the  pollution  is  originating  with  the\nindustrial chemical plants further to  the  west.   If  Industrial  Solvents\nLtd. is contributing to the pollution under their site, it  can  only  be  a\nminor to insignificant amount.\n\nEarly this morning you decided to visit the  Industrial  Solvents  site  one\nmore time,  just  to  be  certain  that  you  had  not  missed  anything  of\nimportance in your general description of the site  and  the  activities  in\nthe plant.  Since the site is not far out of your way from your home to  the\nEnviroconcern offices, and you are by nature an early riser, you arrived  at\nthe Industrial Solvents site about 6:45 a.m., about 45  minutes  before  the\nplant goes into operation on a weekday basis.  After looking  around  inside\nthe plant, you wandered around to the parking lot to  the  west  behind  the\nbuilding to glance at the monitoring well installations in that area.   When\nyou got there, you recognized Ira Klene with a rubberized raincoat over  his\nsuit, wearing boots and standing at one of the monitoring well caps  in  the\nmiddle of the parking lot with his back to you.\n\nSince he had not seen you,  you  stepped  behind  a  pickup  truck  lot  and\ncontinued to observe Mr. Klene's actions.  It soon became  obvious  that  he\nhad a key to the monitoring well caps in one hand and a  hose  connected  to\nthe water spigot on the back of the building in the other.  In the  next  25\nminutes he proceeded from well to well toward the  building,  unlocking  the\nwell caps, inserting the hose and allowing water to flow into each well  for\nseveral minutes.  At first you could  not  believe  what  you  were  seeing.\nPoring water into  these  downgradient  wells  causes  a  reduction  in  the\nmeasured level of toxics in the groundwater  at  those  locations,  creating\nthe appearance of decreasing toxic concentrations across the site from  west\nto east.\n\nNot knowing what to do or  say,  and  not  wanting  to  confront  Mr.  Klene\ndirectly at that moment, you crept back around the truck, waited  until  his\nback was turned, and rapidly went back into the building and out  the  front\nto where you had parked your car, and drove as quickly as possible  to  your\noffice.\n\nAs you sit at your desk you realize that all of the analytical data in  your\nfinal report is now suspect  and  unreliable.   Your  firm's  contract  with\nIndustrial Solvents Ltd. contains a confidentiality clause requiring you  to\ndiscuss  the  findings  in  your  report  with  them  before  releasing  the\ninformation to anyone else.

Her success is  the\nresult of a  lot  of  hard  work  for  more  than  ten  years,  as  well  as\nestablishing excellent relations with her clients.   One  of  the  specialty\nareas that has evolved in her practice has  been  the  renovation  of  major\nhistoric commercial buildings, many in the downtown  financial  district  of\nthe city.\n\nJulie has been asked to do a structural survey of the  Inverness  Block,  an\nold, well-recognized, seven-story granite-faced building  in  the  financial\ndistrict close to several other buildings which her  firm  has  investigated\nfor renovations in the past.  One of her largest clients, Charles A.  Smith,\nis in the final stages of negotiations to sell  the  Inverness  Block  to  a\ngroup of foreign investors represented by Sam Goldworthy, a local  attorney.\n This sale is very important  to  Smith  because  it  is  the  last  of  his\nproperties to be put on the market, and represents  the  liquid  capital  he\nneeds to retire to a 30-acre estate he has acquired on Grand Cayman  Island,\nwhere there is a most advantageous tax structure.\n\nIn order to wrap up some of the final  details  and  firm  up  the  purchase\nprice (which at present is quite generous), Sam Goldworthy has  requested  a\nstructural survey of specific  building  elements,  including  the  outdated\nwindow casements, among  others.   Mr.  Smith  agrees  to  have  the  survey\ncompleted, and negotiates a fair price with Julie  Adams  to  do  the  work.\nThey sign an  agreement  which  contains  Smith’s  usual  clause  that  “all\ninformation discovered by the engineer shall  become  the  property  of  the\nclient (Smith) and shall not be released  to  others  without  the  client’s\nexpress written consent.”\n\nSince Julie is personally tied up with overseeing several structural  design\nprojects and she understands that the results of  the  proposed  survey  are\ncrucial to completing the purchase negotiations for the building before  the\nestablished  deadline,  she  assigns  Brock  Williams,  one  of   her   most\nexperienced  structural  engineers,  to  proceed  with  the  survey  of  the\nInverness Block.  Brock proceeds immediately, covers all  of  the  workscope\nitems required, except for inspection of  the  window  casements,  which  he\nsaves until last.\n\nWhen he gets to the window casements, they appear to be in excellent  shape.\n  However,  since  there  is  so  much  money  involved  in   the   purchase\nnegotiations, he decides to dismantle three units at  random  for  a  better\ndetermination.  With permission from Mr. Smith, Brock  carefully  dismantles\none of the units and uses a flashlight to look into the wall cavity  to  see\nhow the windows are attached.  A steel strap for anchoring  the  windows  is\nclearly visible in the uncovered space.\n\nAs he is about to replace the dismantled window  unit,  Brock  notices  that\nthe three-inch exterior granite veneer is attached to the building  by  clip\nangles welded to the steel building frame, typical of an  early  example  of\nstone-cladding on steel-frame construction.  In the beam of the  flashlight,\nthe clip angle within reach appears to be rusted.  Curious as to the  extent\nof this apparent corrosion, Brock reaches into the space,  grasps  the  clip\nangle and, to his horror, finds that it breaks off in his hand  without  any\nsignificant pressure.  Looking closer at the fracture,  he  determines  that\nthe clip is rusted virtually through the entire cross section.\n\nImmediately the implication of his discovery dawns on Brock, since  if  this\ncondition is typical throughout the building,  the  cost  of  repairs  could\napproach the  value  of  the  building  itself.   As  he  muses  about  this\nunwelcome discovery, he glances down to the street level and  busy  sidewalk\nbelow, and  involuntarily  shudders,  imagining  the  potential  damage  and\ninjury which could be caused if one or more of  the  granite  veneer  blocks\nwere to become dislodged and fall.  Realizing that this  rusted  clip  angle\nmay only be an isolated instance, he quickly dismantles  the  remaining  two\nwindow units, only to discover the  same  situation  with  the  clip  angles\nwithin reach.  Based on this evidence, it appears that the exterior  granite\nveneer  blocks  are  merely  stacked  on  one  another,  with  very   little\nattachment to the building frame.\n\nWorking late that night, Brock finishes his  written  report  covering  only\nthe specific items required in the contract scope of work.  The first  thing\nin the morning, he hands the report to Julie Adams, and orally  advises  her\nof  his  findings  regarding  the  rusted  clip  angles,  which   were   not\nspecifically part of their scope of work.  She in turn makes an  appointment\nwith Charles Smith and delivers the report to him in person that  afternoon.\n At the same time, she advises Smith of the clip angle situation.\n\nSmith thanks Julie for giving him the information, compliments her on  doing\na thorough job, as usual, and says that the written report  will  be  passed\non to Goldworthy, as  requested.   He  then  indicates  that  he  has  other\nimportant matters to attend to and quickly ends the  meeting.   On  the  way\nback to the office, Julie goes over  her  conversation  with  Smith  in  her\nmind, and is bothered by the  sudden  termination  of  the  meeting.   As  a\nresult, she calls Smith on the telephone as soon as she  gets  back  to  her\noffice, indicating that the condition of the  exterior  cladding  is  a  far\nmore important issue than any of the items covered in the written report.\n\nCharles Smith tells her that he appreciates her concern,  but  the  purchase\ndeal is too far along to do anything about it.  Since the buyers  and  their\nrepresentative have had access to the  building  for  several  months,  they\ncould  have  investigated  and  determined  the  condition  of  the  granite\ncladding themselves.  In fact, they may  already  know  about  it  and  have\naccounted for it in their financial offer of  purchase.   If  not,  it  will\nturn up on one of the required periodic building checks in  the  future,  if\nit is really a substantial problem.  In addition, he says that the  deal  is\nnow ready to close the following afternoon, and her  cooperation  in  seeing\nthings his way will result in additional  work  on  other  projects  in  the\nfuture.

In  fact,  Bert's  reputation  recently  convinced  a  much\nlarger engineering firm (Far Horizons Engineering) to offer him  a  sizeable\npromotion to  go  to  work  for  them.   After  considerable  thought,  Bert\naccepted the offer and changed jobs.  The parting between Bert and  the  old\nfirm  (County  Line  Design)  was  amiable  since  Bert's  former  employers\nunderstood the unique opportunity being offered to Bert,  even  though  they\npreferred he stay with them.\n\nBert began his new job with gusto and quickly became  deeply  involved  with\nhis assigned projects.

(a  large  regional\nshopping center developer) to do field explorations and laboratory  testing,\nand make geotechnical  design  recommendations  for  an  extensive  shopping\ncenter mall adjacent to a busy interstate freeway in the Pacific  Northwest.\n   More   specifically,   you   are   responsible   for   site   development\nrecommendations (including extensive cuts, fill  placement  and  compaction)\nand recommendations for foundation support for the proposed mall  buildings.\n The developer has entered into a separate contract with Noall  Engineering,\na civil engineering firm  with  whom  you  have  done  business  previously.\nNoall's responsibility is to design the  proposed  parking  lots,  roadways,\nand  surface  water  drainage  system.   While  you  interact  with  Noall's\nengineers to some extent during your  work,  there  is  no  direct  contract\nbetween the two firms.  Rather, both firms are under  contract  directly  to\nthe developer.  In this way, the  developer  exerts  greater  financial  and\ncost control over the project.\n\nYour analyses indicate  that  the  buildings  may  be  supported  on  spread\nfooting foundations with ground-floor slabs supported on grade, as  long  as\nthe on-site material is placed and compacted properly.\n\nWhile you are completing this work, it becomes obvious that  the  city  will\nnot allow the traffic volume the  new  mall  will  generate  to  be  carried\nentirely on the existing adjacent streets.  As a result, due  to  the  close\nproximity of the interstate freeway, the developer asks your firm  to  do  a\ngeotechnical study and make recommendations for support of a  proposed  off-\nramp from the interstate freeway directly onto the shopping mall property  -\na plan which has been approved by the state  Department  of  Transportation.\nIt is called a \"fly-over ramp\" since  it  consists  of  a  bridge  structure\nwhich will cross over a busy  thoroughfare  in  order  to  access  the  mall\nproperty from the freeway.\n\nYour firm completes the field work and  analyses  for  the  fly-over  bridge\nstructure and recommends that concrete-filled steel pipe piles be  installed\nfor  the  heavy  bridge  column  loads.   You  provide  the  developer  with\nspecifications for the materials and installation of these  pipe  piles  for\ninclusion in the construction contract documents.\n\nThe project is bid in two pieces and awarded to  two  separate  contractors.\nOne is responsible for doing the earthwork and compaction  for  the  general\nsite grading.  The other, Hirise  Construction,  is  a  bridge  construction\ncontractor for  the  fly-over  bridge  ramp.   Your  firm  is  hired  by  NW\nDevelopers to  provide  field  observations  and  testing  during  the  site\ngrading phase of the project, even though Noall made a focused  effort  with\nthe developer to have their field construction technicians on the site  (the\nconstruction period took several months and the  fee  for  the  construction\nobservation services was substantial).\n\nWhile the site grading contract was underway, Hirise began construction  for\nthe  fly-over  bridge  foundation  using  Deepdown  Pile  Driving  as  their\nsubcontractor for the pile  installations.   Deepdown  purchased  the  steel\npipe for the  piles  through  a  Canadian  distributor,  who  supplied  pipe\nfabricated in a far-eastern country.  Noall Engineers convinced  the  owner,\nNW  Developers,  that  their  field  technicians  had  years  of  experience\nobserving and inspecting pile driving  operations,  and  as  a  result  were\nhired by NW Developers to inspect the pile installations.\n\nDuring the  initial  day  or  two  of  pile  driving,  Deepdown  experienced\nproblems in the field which appeared to  baffle  Noall's  field  technician.\nYour field engineer observing the site grading work offered to provide  some\nassistance to Noall's personnel.   NW Developers thanked you for the  offer,\nbut   stated   emphatically   that   the   pile   inspection   was   Noall's\nresponsibility, and  your  firm  was  not  to  interact  with  Noall  unless\nspecifically requested by NW Developers.   The  project  continued  and  you\nwere not requested to assist Noall's personnel.\n\nAfter completion of the fly-over bridge,  Hirise  Construction  submitted  a\nclaim to NW Developers on behalf  of  their  subcontractor,  Deepdown  Pile,\nsaying that the pile design  recommendations  prepared  by  your  firm  were\nfaulty, and they experienced  numerous  difficulties  during  pile  driving,\nincluding splits in the spiral pipe welding and buckled splices  where  pipe\nsections were welded together in the field before  driving.   As  a  result,\nthey ran out of pipe and had to purchase more at a far  greater  unit  price\nthan\nthey had agreed in their contract with  Hirise.   Their  extra  compensation\nclaim was for $125,000 ($125k) and Hirise tacked on an additional  $15k  for\ntheir costs in handling the claim with the developer, for a total  claim  of\n$140k to the developer.\n\nEven though your engineer was  not  allowed  to  observe  the  pile  driving\noperations in the field, you were called in by the developer  and  Noall  to\nreview the situation.  You discover that 1) Deepdown Pile had  ordered  only\nenough pipe to complete the job on the  assumption  that  no  additional  or\nreplacement pipe sections would be  required  during  construction;  2)  the\nlength of pipe ordered by Deepdown was based on the depth to the top of  the\nunderlying denser soil bearing layer, without allowance for  penetration  of\nthe piles into this layer to achieve the  necessary  resistance  to  support\nthe column loads; 3) the last several sets of piles driven were made  of  up\nshort sections welded together in the field, with as  many  as  seven  field\nbutt welds in a 65-foot pile length; 4) photographs of sections of the  pipe\nused clearly showed that the spiral welding was faulty,  and  instead  of  a\nfull thickness of pipe wall across the  welds,  the  spiral  weld  was  just\nbarely holding adjacent sections of  the  pipe  wall  together  because  the\nspiral was out of round; and 5) Noall's field inspector said nothing to  the\ncontractor about these problems during construction and did not  reject  any\nof the pipe material.\n\nThe Developer states that they know nothing about this type  of  thing,  and\nthat it is something that needs to  be  handled  by  Noall  and  your  firm,\ninsinuating that the $140k claim (or whatever is agreed to) should  be  paid\nby someone other than themselves.\n\nShortly thereafter, you are notified by Noall  that  the  developer  has  in\nfact agreed to contribute $50k to settle the claim and Noall is  willing  to\ncontribute $35k to make the problem go away.  They are looking to your  firm\nto come up with the remaining $55k to settle the claim.  You  indicate  that\nthe pile design recommendations were correct, your firm was not  allowed  to\nbe present during the pile driving to solve problems as they  arose  in  the\nfield, and that the evidence indicated that the pipe used in the  piles  was\ninferior.   As  a  result,  your  firm  feels  no  financial  obligation  to\nparticipate in the claim settlement.  You are willing, however,  to  act  in\nbehalf  of  the  developer  and  Noall  in  presenting  and  discussing  the\ntechnical evidence uncovered.\n\nA couple of weeks later you receive a telephone call from  Noall's  attorney\nwho tells you that a mediation hearing is scheduled  and  that  you  are  to\nappear.

This\nhas  historically  enabled  Choice  Engineering  to  compete  for   projects\neffectively, since all the necessary disciplines for a project  are  managed\nin-house, and there is close control over project costs.  As a  result,  the\ncompany has gained a reputation for completing project designs on  time  and\nwell within budget, which has brought clients to the door with  very  little\nmarketing effort.\n\nIn recent years, however, Choice has felt  the  impact  of  several  smaller\nfirms who tend to band together on a project-by-project basis, depending  on\nthe expertise  required.   Most  of  these  firms  are  quite  small,  their\noverhead expenses are minimal (many work out of their  attics  or  garages),\nand only have three or four  highly  trained  people  in  the  firm.   These\ncoalitions have been successful in  being  awarded  design  contracts  which\nChoice traditionally handled.  As  a  result,  the  company  is  faced  with\neither divesting  themselves  of  several  areas  of  engineering  expertise\ninvolving more than 200 employees, or taking their  existing  structure  and\nproject approach to new geographic markets.\n\nThe company is not willing to hire an outside marketing expert.   They  tend\nto be expensive, and there is a lot of time, effort and  money  involved  in\ngetting them to the point where  they  understand  what  your  company  does\nbefore being able to identify new markets, let  alone  obtain  new  clients.\nAs it turns out, you are  the  only  person  in  the  company's  engineering\nmanagement that has both a degree in engineering and a degree  in  economics\nand business administration.

This  seems  to  be  a\nreasonable approach, so you contact  a  firm  recommended  to  you  by  your\nsecretary's uncle, Hugh Rodman, who is  from  Utopia,  called  International\nAffiliates Ltd.

They  will  make  the  proper\nintroductions, assist in a preparing the budget for the petrochemical  plant\ndesign, and secure the necessary permits when  the  project  is  awarded  to\nChoice, as is certain to happen if International Affiliates is part  of  the\nteam.  When asked how many people are in International Affiliates, he  tells\nyou there are four, including a brother, nephew and  his  wife  who  runs  a\nvariety of errands from time to time.\n\nOwatadeel has now sent you an email indicating that his fee for  setting  up\nthe project on his books is US$50,000 as a retainer to  start.

Most of your clients  are  municipalities,  counties,  state  and\nfederal agencies, in  addition  to  large-scale  commercial  and  industrial\ndevelopers.  Because your projects  are  usually  some  distance  from  your\noffice, it is not unusual for you to spend a considerable amount of time  on\nthe telephone communicating with the client who is  often  headquartered  in\nanother state or region of the country, as well  as  other  members  of  the\ndesign team, and regulatory agencies.  The long distance  telephone  charges\nfor these calls can accumulate to an appreciable amount over the  course  of\na project.\n\nAs mundane as it may seem, one of the sticky problems you encounter all  the\ntime is how to bill  your  clients  for  “out-of-pocket”  or  “reimbursable”\nexpenses.  Almost all of the clients insist that these  expenses  be  passed\non to them at actual cost,  without  a  mark-up  for  your  associated  real\noverhead costs.  These overhead costs include business  taxes,  professional\nliability insurance based on your gross (total) billings, and  the  cost  of\nfinancing from the time the costs are incurred to the time reimbursement  is\nreceived from the client (often  three,  four  or  more  months  after  they\nreceive your invoice).\n\nSeveral years ago, your firm, along with  approximately  120  other  similar\nfirms across the country, decided to form  a  professional  organization  to\nprovide assistance to its members focused on the business  aspects  of  your\nprofessional practice (a topic often not covered to any  extent  in  college\nor graduate school).   The  name  of  the  organization  is  the  Associated\nServices Society, and its executive director is I. B. Wiley, a man  who  has\nhad several years of experience dealing with the business and  legal  issues\ncommonly encountered in your area of practice.\n\nAs a service to the Society’s members, I. B.

No\n   longer will you have to stress over recouping overhead  costs  associated\n   with the long distance telephone charges passed on to your clients.\n\n   CCC’s service allows you to receive your monthly long distance  telephone\n   bill from CCC with a client-by-client or  project-by-project  accounting,\n   thereby saving considerable clerical effort at billing time  when  it  is\n   necessary to accumulate, list and invoice long distance charges.  Of even\n   greater importance, CCC can send you two telephone bills,  if  you  wish.\n   One of them is the ‘normal’ bill.  The other bill  includes  an  internal\n   markup based on a percentage of your  choosing,  project  by  project  or\n   client by client.  You are then able  to  send  a  copy  of  this  second\n   telephone bill to your clients as backup for the charges  shown  on  your\n   invoice to them.   All  you  need  do  is  notify  CCC  of  the  specific\n   percentage to be added to calls for individual clients or  projects  when\n   you initiate your own internal project accounting.\n\n   No longer will you have to lose money on these  long  distance  telephone\n   charges.  In fact, you can even turn a profit on your telephones!   Other\n   Society members using this service are excited and pleased.

A licensed engineer, he has held  this\nposition for fifteen years and is highly regarded by  his  peers  and  well-\nliked by those he supervises.\n\nBesides  Clayton,  the  other  full  time  employees  in  the  Public  Works\ndepartment include the City Engineer/  Deputy  Director  for  Public  Works,\nplus two assistant engineers,  a  special  projects  coordinator,  a  survey\ncrew, three inspectors, and an executive secretary, Eleanor.  All  employees\nare on the city merit system.  Eleanor is 55 years old  and  has  worked  in\nthe Public Works department in Springfield for 35 years.  Earlier  directors\nhave seen her as indispensable,  and  she  has  worked  more  as  an  office\nmanager or administrative assistant than as a clerical worker.\n\nIn the last five years, however, things have not gone well for  Eleanor.   A\nseries of family tragedies has left her feeling beaten  down.   Her  husband\nhad a stroke one year ago and is now an invalid.  She and her  husband  have\nno children, and it is only her salary and health insurance  that  keep  him\nfrom a lower quality nursing care home.  Eleanor herself suffers  from  poor\nhealth, and now has only a fraction of the energy she  used  to  have,  this\ndue to the strain of looking  after  her  husband  every  day,  as  well  as\nkeeping up their house by herself.\n\nClayton is sympathetic to the problems that Eleanor is having.  He is  aware\nof the contributions she made to the Public Works department  in  the  past.\nFor years, he  believes,  she  was  underpaid.   Her  actual  worth  to  the\ndepartment was much greater than any rating she could have received  in  the\nold sex-biased system.  Because of  her  poor  health  and  other  problems,\nhowever, it is now questionable  whether  she  minimally  achieves  what  is\ntechnically required in her position as an executive secretary (her  present\nmerit position).\n\nConsidering these things, Clayton has kept Eleanor on the  payroll  but  six\nmonths ago hired another secretary, Pauline,  part-time  for  30  hours  per\nweek, to compensate.  Eleanor now spends more of her time as a  receptionist\nthan as an executive secretary.  While Pauline has expressed  no  resentment\nto anyone, she does notice she is  doing  all  the  work  while  Eleanor  is\ngetting executive secretary pay for doing essentially nothing.\n\nTo further complicate matters, one of the largest employers  in  the  region\nrecently shut its doors, going  off  the  tax  rolls  and  cutting  about  8\npercent of the local jobs in Springfield.  The ripple  effect  is  projected\nto reduce next year’s tax revenue by 15 percent  and  the  Springfield  City\nCouncil has demanded that the City Manager make the budget balance.\n\nThe ambitious new City Engineer/ Deputy Director for  Public  Works,  Allan,\nwho just completed an executive MBA program and has  his  sights  set  on  a\nhigh-profile public works career in the nearby state capitol, meets  monthly\nwith Clayton to discuss project issues and  department  business.   At  this\nmonth’s meeting, Allan informs Clayton that he thinks Eleanor is  rated  too\nhigh for the work she presently does and that the  Public  Works  department\nis not getting its money’s worth out of her.  In light  of  budgetary  needs\nthat the department has, Allan  proposes  letting  Eleanor  go.   There  are\nmeasurable  skills  and  reasonable  expectations   that   she   no   longer\ndemonstrates competence in.\n\nClayton agrees that logically, the merit system, and the good of the  Public\nWorks department, seem to dictate such a decision.  He feels, however,  that\nthe department owes Eleanor some help in her more troubled times,  at  least\nuntil  she  is  eligible  to  collect  her  pension.   The   civil   service\nregulations don’t give Clayton much flexibility.  He can keep Eleanor on  in\nher present position, or let her go with minimal benefits.

Karful, a wastewater process engineer with Slud, Gefl,  Owsdown  &\nHill (SGOH), has spent the last few weeks  designing  an  equalization  tank\nfor the wastewater treatment  plant  for  the  town  of  Whiteside.   It  so\nhappens that the existing  extended  aeration  treatment  plant  is  located\ninside  one  room  of  a  pre-engineered  metal  building,  except  for  the\nheadworks, which consist of a screen.  The design that Reilly  is  proposing\nincludes installing a new tank inside the treatment room and relocating  the\nscreen on top of the tank.\n\nDuring a design review, the reviewer, Yvonne Moore-Karful (distant  relation\nto Reilly) of the architectural firm Plansem & Drawsem, notices that  sewage\nplant headworks are covered by National Fire Protection  Association  (NFPA)\nCode Section 820, which requires certain areas to be Class I, Division 1  or\nClass  I,  Division  2;  i.e.,  “explosion  proof.”   Concerned  about   the\npotential problem, Yvonne calls to let Reilly know that  moving  the  screen\ninto the  treatment  room  would  require  the  room  to  be  classified  as\nexplosion proof, and she follows up this call with a memo and her  notations\non the design drawings.  Reilly decides  to  double-check  this  information\nand he reviews NFPA 820 himself.  The code indeed  appears  to  require  the\nheadworks and the existing treatment room to be explosion proof because  the\nplant does not have primary settling tanks.\n\nReilly informs the  project  manager  at  SGOH,  Dante  McWaves,  about  the\nmatter, and gives him a copy of Yvonne’s memo.  With Reilly in  his  office,\nDante phones the client, Bull Parker, the town  commissioner,  to  make  him\naware of Reilly’s concerns.  Bull happens to be cleaning  his  shotgun  when\nhe gets Dante’s call.  News of cost increases and  delays  does  not  please\nBull, and he pointedly reminds Dante that the  project  is  behind-schedule,\nthat Whiteside needs this addition to  the  wastewater  treatment  plant  to\navoid non-compliance with State regulations, and that  Whiteside  is  not  a\nwealthy town.  As he trips the action on the  shotgun,  as  if  to  place  a\nshell in the chamber (Dante hears this over the  phone),  Bull  tells  Dante\nthat he’ll have the County Fire Code Official,  Bobby  Burns,  get  back  to\nDante.\n\nReilly notices the color drain from Dante’s face and that his hands  visibly\nshake as he hangs up the phone.  Within  minutes,  the  fire  code  official\ncalls and informs Dante that the existing room is already  explosion  proof.\nWhat luck!  The problem is solved and Dante, still  pale  yet  with  obvious\nrelief, informs Reilly that he doesn’t want to bother  Bull  with  any  more\nproblems.  Dante then clearly and unequivocally  directs  Reilly  to  finish\nthe project.\n\nBut Reilly is concerned.  While  Bobby  Burns’  statement  satisfies  Dante,\nReilly suspects the fire code official could be wrong.   Though  Reilly  has\nlimited experience with fire codes,  he  has  noticed  that  the  electrical\nsockets, light  switches,  lighting  fixtures,  and  junction  boxes  appear\nnormal and don’t give the appearance of being explosion proof.   While  part\nof him wants to pursue the matter,  he  also  realizes  that  exploring  his\ndoubts about the existing room being explosion proof will not  only  further\nstress out  Dante,  but  could  result  in  additional  project  delays,  in\nWhiteside having to fund an  expensive  retrofit  to  bring  their  existing\nfacility up to code, and in further annoying Bull.\n\nWhat, if anything, should Reilly do?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reilly should conduct further research and investigation to verify whether the existing treatment room is truly explosion proof according to the NFPA 820 code requirements.

In  eighteen  years  of  service  to  Plebian,  Topher\ncannot remember ever being so concerned about the welfare of his  community.\n The townspeople  are  his  family,  his  lifelong  friends  and  his  chief\nconcern, and they have always  trusted  Topher  to  make  the  wisest,  most\nsensible decisions on behalf of the community.  This faith in his  abilities\nis what Topher is the most apprehensive about with regards  to  his  current\nsituation.\n\nIn 1979, the year that Topher graduated with  his  engineering  degree  from\nKansas State University, Jim Barton, a Plebian farmer,  resident,  and  city\ncouncil member, opened his first retail outlet store, “Bar-Low’s.” His  sole\nintent was to provide consumers with what he  valued  most:  low  prices,  a\nfamily-friendly atmosphere, and southern hospitality.  Because  of  Barton’s\npriority of satisfying his customers  efficiently  and  economically,  “Bar-\nLow’s” has grown to become the largest retail chain in the world.\n\nBut this growth has caused stress in Plebian.  Due  to  increasing  interest\nin the investments of the chain, national  manufacturers  are  beginning  to\nmove their businesses to where their money is—Plebian,  KA.   Culture  shock\nhas already emerged as businesses and their employees relocate to the  small\ncommunity.\n\nTopher is aware of the discomfort  that  the  “outsiders”  are  causing  the\ntown’s residents.  In fact, one member of the Plebian  community  last  week\nwrote a letter to the editor of the  local  newspaper  and  complained  that\n“these big ol’ trucks just keep movin’ people into town like cattle. .  .  I\ndo believe I saw a feller with purple hair and a bolt through his nose  move\nin next door to  me  Mondee.”    The  media  is  having  a  field  day,  and\nreporters like to refer to this strange  mix  as  “urban  chic  meets  rural\nlimbo.”\n\nBut Topher is beginning  to  realize  that  “progress”  could  result  in  a\ndivisive fight for  the  heart  and  values  of  Plebian.   Development  has\ncreated physical, cultural and economic barriers between old-time  residents\nand newcomers.   Special interests have begun to polarize  City  opinion  on\nthis matter, some arguing that Jim  Barton  would  never  have  wanted  such\ngrowth if it meant running over  the  “little  guy,”  and  others  embracing\ngrowth as the sure means of a better life for all.\n\nIt all comes down to land.  Vast acres of land have already been  bought  up\nby investors in order to facilitate the new businesses and  their  employees\ndaily  arriving  in  Plebian.  Cappuccino  shops,  golf   courses,   housing\neditions, restaurants, hotels, and shopping centers have  been  built,  with\nmore in the developmental  stages,  and  the  plan  is  that  they  will  be\nconstructed as quickly as possible in order to facilitate the (wealthy)  new\narrivals with their penchant for the finer things of life.\n\nIn fact, the City just received a preliminary  application  for  development\nof  “Windsor  Ridge”,  an  upscale,  gated  community  east  of   town   and\nencompassing several hundred acres of prime  Plebian  countryside.    Topher\nis quite familiar with the site, since he and his  boyhood  friends  fished,\nhunted, and explored this area when he was growing up.  In his  professional\nrole as  City  Engineer,  Topher  now  must  approve  this  application  for\ncompliance with City codes and regulations.\n\nBecause of his personal knowledge  of  the  Windsor  Ridge  property,  while\nlooking over the drawings, Topher notices that Windsor Ridge  may  adversely\naffect  several  of  Plebian’s  poorer  families  who  live  south  of   the\ndevelopment.  These residents are descendants of settlers  who  arrived  145\nyears ago, and like family farmers everywhere, they have struggled  to  make\nit.  Six generations are buried in the little cemetery lying behind the one-\nroom Primitive Baptist Church.  It  is  here  that  development  of  Windsor\nRidge will likely cause secondary impacts, that is, an increase  in  vehicle\ntraffic and modified drainage patterns on the property.\n\nHowever, the design engineers have done a thorough  job,  and  the  proposed\ndevelopment itself appears to meet all  codes  and  regulations.   Not  only\nthis, but  Topher  notices  with  admiration  that  the  new  infrastructure\nassociated with the Windsor Ridge development will definitely  help  resolve\none of Plebian’s  (and  his)  more  pressing  water  pressure  problems  and\ntransportation  bottlenecks.   This  is  just  the  type  of  benefit   that\nPlebian’s new mayor, a long-time resident elected on a platform  of  managed\ngrowth, emphasized in her campaign.  Since the mayor is  Topher’s  boss,  it\nis clearly in Topher’s personal interest to approve the  development  if  it\nsatisfies all requirements.\n\nThus, Topher is torn.  On the one hand, he sees  the  economic  benefits  of\nprogress, but as Plebian’s native  son,  he  feels  sympathy  for  both  the\nimpacted community downstream and for  the  old-time  Plebian  residents  as\nmore of their precious community and land will be sacrificed  on  the  altar\nof financial prosperity.\n\nOf course, there is really not much Topher can do  other  than  approve  the\ndrawings, since after all, they are quite thorough.  But then  again,  there\nmight be something.  Topher realizes that the poor  families  downstream  of\nWindsor Ridge would  make  the  perfect  “poster  children”  for  the  anti-\ndevelopment faction in Plebian.  If the  leaders  of  this  faction  somehow\nwere to learn of Topher’s insight  about  the  potential  adverse  secondary\nimpacts, Topher is confident they could raise such a fuss  that  development\nwould surely halt.  All it would take is one clandestine phone call.\n\nThe beauty of Plebian’s environment and its culture for  future  generations\nhangs in the balance.

Three years ago an engineering consultant issued a  report  which\nstated, among other things, that the existing water main  in  Shadyvale  was\ngenerally in good condition but was extremely old.  Further, the water  main\nno longer is large enough for all of  the  properties  served.   Since  that\ntime, the Town Selectmen have been trying to  secure  the  funds  needed  to\nreplace the old main with a new main of  larger  diameter,  but  they  still\ncannot afford to do so.\n\nHowever, the State Department of Transportation (DOT) is planning a  highway\nreconstruction  project  in  Shadyvale.   Warren,  a  senior  planning   and\nprogramming engineer, is  the  senior  DOT  engineer  responsible  for  this\nproject.  Although he now lives in the Capitol City,  Warren  was  born  and\nraised in a small village not far from Shadyvale, next door to  his  boyhood\nfriend, Earnest “Red”  Anderson.   With  a  twinge  of  nostalgia  and  fond\nmemories of a more peaceful time, Warren confidently delegates  the  project\nto one of his subordinates, Dianne, a young engineer  intern  about  to  sit\nfor the PE exam.\n\nDianne is well liked, highly competent, and by all indications, will go  far\nin the Department.  As per standard practice, Dianne  initiates  the  design\nlayout for the Shadyvale  project  to  avoid  conflicts  with  the  existing\nutilities, including the old water main.  She  understands  that  State  DOT\npolicy unambiguously requires that only unavoidable utility  conflicts  will\nbe paid for as part of highway projects and that other utility  work  is  to\nbe  considered  as  a  betterment  that  must  be  paid  for  by  the  local\nmunicipality.  This is quite fresh on her mind, since due to a  downturn  in\nthe State’s economy, several layoffs have occurred in the State  government,\nand recent memos have repeatedly emphasized fiscal belt-tightening.\n\nWith the design at about 30 percent completion,  Dianne  submits  a  set  of\ndrawings to Warren for his review and comment.  She also recommends  a  site\nvisit to observe the route, tie down several details,  and  resolve  various\ndesign issues.  On the appointed morning, Warren and Dianne secure  a  State\nvehicle and make the very pleasant drive to Shadyvale.  The  stress  of  the\ncity  fades  with  each  mile  as  they  drive  through  some  of  the  most\npicturesque scenery in the State.\n\n“I’ll definitely have to bring the wife  back  in  September  to  enjoy  the\nfoliage,”  muses  Warren  to  himself  as  they  drive  into  town.   Shops,\nrestaurants, and even the local garage still have that  old-town  feel.   As\nexpected, it is a wonderful day in the field, and Dianne busily gathers  the\ninformation she needs to take the  drawings  to  the  next  level.   In  the\nmeantime, Warren  takes  the  opportunity  to  explore  the  town.   To  his\npleasant surprise, he learns that his friend, Red Anderson, still  lives  in\nShadyvale, and in fact is the senior Town Selectman.\n\nUpon learning of Warren’s being in Shadyvale, Red invites Warren and  Dianne\nto lunch at one of the local cafes.  In  addition  to  catching  up  on  old\ntimes, Red recounts Shadyvale’s water main problem and  how  the  town  just\nsees no way to get together the kind of money needed  for  such  a  project.\nDianne is well aware of the location of this water main – she  knows  Warren\nis too – she made a conscious decision to design around it.  But neither  of\nthem says anything, not wanting to spoil such a  friendly  visit.   After  a\ngood meal, good conversation, and plans for Warren and Red to  get  together\nin the near future, Warren and Dianne depart from Shadyvale.\n\nOn the way back to Department headquarters, Dianne comments to Warren  about\nhow, in view of their conversation with Red,  she  feels  disappointed  that\nshe must align the new closed  drainage  system  for  this  project  on  the\nopposite side of the road from the old water main.  The facts are, were  the\nproposed drainage system to impact the existing  water  main,  it  could  be\ndealt with simply as an added share  to  the  Engineer's  Estimate  for  the\nTown's cost, and Shadyvale would only be responsible for the  difference  in\nprice between the size of the  now-impacted  existing  water  main  and  the\nproposed larger size (about $25,000), rather than for all of the water  main\nwork (over $350,000).  “It’s just too bad,” she sighed.\n\nWarren  had  been  silent,  listening  to  Dianne’s  comments  and  line  of\nreasoning.  After she finished her thought, just as they were  pulling  into\nDOT headquarters, Warren looked directly at Dianne  and  stated  in  an  odd\nsort of way, “Yes, the citizens of Shadyvale are  really  fine  people,  and\nthey deserve the best the State DOT can offer.  I want you to  do  a  really\nthorough job on the layout, and I’ll back you 100 percent.”  Then,  as  they\nwere getting out of the car, Warren added, “By  the  way,  Dianne,  you  had\nmentioned that you were going to send  me  a  reference  form  for  your  PE\nlicense.  Please get that to me and I’ll complete it right away.”\n\nIt is now the  next  morning.   Dianne  is  at  her  desk,  looking  at  the\nShadyvale drawings.  It seems obvious to her based on  Warren’s  clandestine\nremark that he wants her to change the design so that Shadyvale’s old  water\nmain is impacted, thus requiring the State DOT to bear most of the  cost  of\nreplacing it.  This could be justified  easily  enough,  and  no  subsequent\nreviewer would question the issue if Warren signs off on this as he says  he\nwill.  After all, it is not like Warren is asking her to embezzle funds  for\npersonal use or anything.  But Dianne knows this action  is  not  consistent\nwith DOT  policy.   A  voice  inside  screams,  “What  about  your  ethics?”\nImmediately  another  voice   replies,   “What   about   your   PE   license\nrecommendation  from  Warren?”   Yet  another  pipes  up,  “What  about  the\ndeserving citizens of Shadyvale?” And on it goes.\n\nHow should Dianne proceed with this matter?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Dianne should adhere to the State DOT policy and continue with the original design that avoids impacting the old water main in Shadyvale. She should not make any changes to the design that would require the State DOT to bear most of the cost of replacing the water main, as this goes against the policy that only unavoidable utility conflicts will be paid for as part of highway projects.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nOn a Saturday in February 2018, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf announced at a press conference that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would be performing raids around the Bay Area the following day.  At the time of her announcement, Schaaf said, “I am sharing this information publicly not to panic our residents but to protect them....My priority is for the well-being and safety of all residents—particularly our most vulnerable.\"  The raids resulted in the detainment of 232 suspected undocumented immigrants, half of whom had criminal convictions.\n\nICE officials, Attorney General Jeff Sessions of the U.S. Justice Department, and the White House all criticized Schaaf for her decision to announce the raids.  They argued that the warning caused an increased risk to ICE officers.  Immigration organizations also criticized her decision by saying it could have set off a panic in the immigrant community and Oakland in general.  Additionally, Noel Gallo, an Oakland City Councilman, said that annoying the feds isn’t in the city’s best interest.  And Joe Tuman, a San Francisco State University professor, suggested that there may have been a quieter way to go about spreading this information to the local immigrant community rather than having a press conference.\n\nOne major point of criticism was that Schaaf was playing politics with this warning.  Schaaf is a liberal mayor of a notoriously liberal and diverse city, and she has been very outspoken in her disdain for the Trump administration, even calling Trump the “Bully in Chief.”  Schaaf also said the raids were both racist and politically motivated, and that the Trump administration is purposefully targeting California because it is liberal. Critics of her actions claim that her announcement was pandering to her base while jeopardizing the lives of law enforcement officials.\n\nICE Deputy Director Thomas D. Homan said that Schaaf’s announcement probably tipped off people with criminal records, allowing them to elude authorities, and called the decision “irresponsible” and “reckless.”  After the raids, Homan said that 864 immigrants with criminal records “remain at large in the community” and directly blamed Schaaf for this.\n\nSchaaf responded to criticism by saying she felt she had a moral and ethical obligation to say something. She said she received the information about the raid through unofficial government channels, and she believes she didn’t obstruct justice or break the law since the information came via nongovernmental sources. Schaaf also justified the decision by saying that Oakland has a legal right to be a sanctuary city, and they haven’t broken any laws; however, Schaaf’s assertion that she had the “right” to warn the immigrant community because Oakland is a sanctuary city is up for debate.  According to the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics’ Government Ethics Director Hana Callaghan, sanctuary city status means that the municipality has determined it will not use city resources to assist the federal government in its immigration enforcement policies unless presented with a lawful court order; being a sanctuary city does not mean government officials can hinder lawful processes.\n\nTo complicate matters further, a spokesman for ICE, James Schwab, resigned over “false” and “misleading” statements he said were made by Homan and Sessions.  Specifically, Schwab claims that the 864 immigrants with criminal records number referenced by Homan and Sessions was inflated and inaccurate.  Schwab said, “I quit because I didn’t want to perpetuate misleading facts….I asked them to change the information. I told them that the information was wrong, they asked me to deflect, and I didn’t agree with that. Then I took some time, and I quit.”\n\nSchaaf applauded Schwab’s resignation, saying that public servants should act with integrity and transparency.\n\nThe Trump administration is now suing California over its sanctuary city laws."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Given the scenario, I would first review the specific laws and regulations governing the sharing of information related to ICE raids and the responsibilities of local government officials in sanctuary cities like Oakland.

Patients must come in each morning to get a supervised daily dose of medication and attend a group therapy session. There is more need than available treatment slots, so many patients have waited significant time while addicted before getting this chance for help. \n\nThis morning you have an appointment with 40-year old Jerome.

Bush.\n\nThe developers of the AI-generated Carlin did not get permission from Carlin’s family for their project. Carlin’s daughter reacted to it on X: “These AI generated products are clever attempts at trying to recreate a mind that will never exist again… Let’s let the artist’s work speak for itself.”\n\nToward the end of Carlin’s life, many people on the internet attributed to him things that he had never said—including statements that ran counter to his actual views. In response, he wrote, \"Here's a rule of thumb, folks: nothing you see on the #Internet is mine unless it comes from one of my albums, books, HBO specials, or appeared on my website. [...] It bothers me that some people might believe that I would be capable of writing some of this stuff.\"\n\nThe AI-generated “Carlin” commented on many current topics, including the impact and potential of AI itself. The program included dozens of AI-generated images.\n\nWithin weeks of the publication of the video, the George Carlin estate sued the show’s creators, who then removed it from their YouTube channel; the lawsuit was settled in April, with a permanent injunction that bans the defendants from re-uploading the video.\n\nCarlin’s daughter subsequently commented that this case “serves as a warning about the dangers posed by AI technologies and the need for appropriate safeguards not just for artists and creatives, but every human on earth.” "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would reach out to the George Carlin estate and Carlin's daughter to offer my assistance in ensuring that any AI-generated content featuring Carlin's likeness or voice in the future is done with proper authorization and respect for his legacy.

Ben made it a point to immerse himself in the local culture during his business travels, dedicating an extra day or two to learn about the culture before heading into his company’s office or factory in whatever location he was at. \n\nOn one trip, Ben traveled to Chennai, India, to visit JP, a lead manager in the local operation. Ben asked JP to spend the day with him exploring the area and its traditions, and JP graciously agreed and took Ben on an eye-opening excursion to a nearby village that, like many in rural India, was poor. Ben noticed JP’s close connections with the villagers. JP, an esteemed member of the Brahmin caste and an elder at the Hindu temple, was highly respected and considered a leader in the community. Ben was grateful for the warm welcome extended to him by the villagers and appreciated the effort JP put into arranging this visit. \n\nBut Ben also found himself in an uncomfortable spot. \n\nJP wanted to take Ben to this particular village not only because he knew the people well, but also because a local Chennai clothing company had recently established a business here and he thought Ben would be interested in this new development. The company had adopted a business model that involved renting looms to families in the village, which enabled them to produce cloth materials and fulfill orders from the company. While the families earned money for the piece work, they also had to pay the rent for the looms. \n\nAs Ben observed the process, he couldn’t help but notice children as young as ten working at the looms. When visiting one family, Ben and JP met with the parents who told them how this local business was really helping their family. And, as they said that, their two children sat nearby working at the looms. \n\nBen was cut to the core. He had read about the dangers of child labor and in particular about the way that work on looms can be especially harmful (and how children due to their better eyesight and ability to see subtle distinctions in color are in demand to work on looms).

It was also clear that the children’s parents didn’t object and that the whole village appeared to be on board with this income-producing project. \n\nAs Ben’s visit to the village came to an end, some of the villagers, including JP, eagerly asked him to share with them his thoughts on the new business development in the village.

For years, the nonprofit had been collecting a database of messages exchanged, and used the data to triage the incoming calls for help and to train its volunteers to better manage their difficult conversations with people in great distress. In a 2020 report, the nonprofit (which first launched in 2013) stated that “[b]y implementing data science tools and machine learning from day one, [it had] created the largest mental health dataset in the world.” A report section titled “Data Philosophy” added, “we share data to support smarter research, policy, and community organizing. Unlike other large-scale data sets on mental health and crisis, our data has incredible volume, velocity, and variety.”\n\nAs Politico reported, in 2018 the nonprofit also launched a for-profit spinoff called Loris.ai, which planned to use Crisis Text Line data (which it said was anonymized) to gain insights that would then be incorporated into customer-support software products. The plan was for a portion of the profits from that software to then be shared with the Crisis Text Line.\n\nThe Politico article sparked a great deal of criticism of that data-sharing agreement. Some critics were concerned that the data might still be traceable back to individuals who could then be stigmatized or otherwise harmed by being “outed” as dealing with severe mental health issues. Others argued that even anonymized data should not be used in ways that the people who texted in would not have anticipated—in other words, for purposes distinct from helping them directly. When the organization responded that its data-sharing agreement was disclosed to users (whose first text is answered by an automated reply that reads “By texting further with us, you agree to our Terms” and links to a 50-page agreement), critics questioned whether the mere act of users following through, under such circumstances, could be deemed to be “actual meaningful, emotional, fully understood consent.”\n\nSome of the Crisis Text Line volunteers were greatly concerned by the secondary use of the data collected by the nonprofit, and raised those concerns both internally and externally. Once a petition was organized, demanding an end to the data sharing agreement, other volunteers expressed shock that they had not even been aware of the for-profit effort.\n\nA few days after the Politico article was published, Crisis Text Line announced that it was ending the data-sharing agreement with Loris.ai. In a subsequent personal blog post responding to the controversy, researcher danah boyd, who had been a founding board member of CTL and had served as its board chair for some time, explained her thinking and her actions regarding the controversial arrangement. “Since my peers are asking for this to be a case study in tech ethics, I am going into significant detail,” she wrote. \n\nPart of it highlights one of the questions that arose early on in the development of the organization: “could we construct our training so that all counselors got to learn from the knowledge developed by those who came before them? This would mean using texter data for a purpose that went beyond the care and support of that individual.” boyd writes,\n\nYes, the Terms of Service allowed this, but this is not just a legal question; it’s an ethical question. Given the trade-offs, I made a judgment call early on that not only was using texter data to strengthen training of counselors without their explicit consent ethical, but that to not do this would be unethical. Our mission is clear: help people in crisis. To do this, we need to help our counselors better serve texters. We needed to help counselors learn and grow and develop skills with which they can help others.\nThe post continues, discussing additional challenges related to scaling access to the service, triage of incoming texts, the need for funding, and the desire to facilitate important research. After noting that she struggled with the question of sharing data with the for-profit entity, boyd states that she ultimately did vote in favor of it. She adds, “Knowing what I know now, I would not have.”\n\nThe blog post ends with a call for input: “I also have some honest questions,” boyd writes, “for all of you who are frustrated, angry, disappointed, or simply unsure about us.” Among those questions: “What is the best way to balance the implicit consent of users in crisis with other potentially beneficial uses of data which they likely will not have intentionally consented to but which can help them or others?” She also asks, “Is there any structure in which lessons learned from a non-profit service provider can be transferred to a for-profit entity?

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nMosquito-borne diseases are a major concern in many parts of the globe. Diseases that spread to people via mosquitos, including Zika virus, West Nile virus, dengue, and malaria, have serious negative impacts on human health.\n\nA company we’ll call Kill-M, has utilized CRISPR technology to create a mosquito that will prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases by reducing the number of breeding mosquitoes--fewer mosquitos, fewer bites; fewer bites, less disease. Using CRISPR, male mosquitos are genetically modified so that their offspring die before reaching sexual maturity, thus decreasing the mosquito population.\n\nThis technique to reduce the insect population is called the “sterile insect technique,” which ordinarily involves sterilizing insects such as the screw worm and the Mediterranean fruit fly using radiation, not genetic engineering. Radiation is generally quite successful, especially at eliminating invasive insect species. But, radiation kills mosquitoes, so CRISPR technology, rather than radiation, is used to edit mosquito genes.\n\nEcologists have expressed concern at the use of the sterile insect technique to eradicate local insect populations. Eliminating a species of insect like mosquitoes reduces local biodiversity, which is concerning because it accompanies wider trends in decreasing global biodiversity. The elimination of an insect species can also influence other areas of the environment, such as predators who eat the insects or plant species that need to be pollinated.\n\nNow, consider this: In Brazil, there is an urgent outbreak of Zika, a serious illness with no vaccine for prevention or cure once contracted. The symptoms of Zika are usually fairly mild, and may include fever, muscle soreness, headache and rash. Zika is not deadly, and symptoms will usually clear up in about a week without medical intervention. However, Zika is a concern for pregnant women, because the infection can be passed to her fetus causing severe birth defects including severe brain development issues, notably, microcephaly. Kill-M has been asked by the Brazilian Department of Public Health, SUS, to bring their CRISPR sterile insect technology to Brazil in order to eliminate the mosquito population and stop the spread of Zika.\n\nIt is unknown what degree of reduction in the mosquito population is required in order to make a positive impact on human health in Brazil (or elsewhere). In order to ensure success of the project and eliminate the spread of disease to pregnant women, Kill-M plans to release enough genetically modified mosquitoes to wipe out the entire native population of mosquitoes within six months.\n\nThere is significant uncertainty about the long-term outcomes of releasing a population of genetically modified mosquitoes into the environment in response to Zika in Brazil. Predator species like bats, which are critical to the ecosystem, may be negatively affected by losing a food source. Additionally, mosquitoes are pollinators, so their elimination from the environment may negatively affect native flora and farming in Brazil.\n\nNow consider another potential application of the CRISPR technology. A wealthy neighborhood in Florida has decided that they want to hire Kill-M to wipe out the mosquito population in their community. The mosquitoes in this region are not disease vectors, rather, they are simply annoying pests. The residents argue that insect repellants are unpleasant and ineffective. The promise of a mosquito-free vacation will increase the number of visitors to the community, and increase revenue from tourism in addition to increasing the comfort of year-round residents.\n\nThere are several reasons why some people are at greater risk of being bitten by mosquitoes than others. These can include: the bacterial population on the skin, how much someone is sweating, a person’s blood type, and the presence of certain genetic markers. Suppose the FDA has recently approved a pill that makes people completely repellent to mosquitoes. By taking the inexpensive pill once a day, residents and tourists can completely avoid mosquito bites. However, there are some mild, but unpleasant, side effects including a risk of unusual bleeding and a drop in blood sugar associated with taking the pill. People on blood thinners or who are taking insulin for diabetes should use extreme caution in taking this medication for more than a day or two. Environmental activists argue that despite the risks, the town in Florida should take this drug instead of eliminating the mosquito population.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the context of the scenario provided, I would take the following specific actions:\n\n1.

Engage in open dialogue with local communities in Brazil to gather their input and concerns regarding the release of genetically modified mosquitoes. This would involve holding public meetings, consulting with community leaders, and addressing any questions or objections raised by residents.\n\n3. Collaborate with environmental organizations and researchers to explore alternative methods for controlling mosquito populations in Brazil that may have less impact on local ecosystems. This could include investigating the use of natural predators, biological control agents, or habitat modification techniques.\n\n4. Implement a monitoring and evaluation plan to track the outcomes of the mosquito population reduction efforts in Brazil over time. This would involve collecting data on mosquito abundance, disease transmission rates, and ecosystem health to assess the effectiveness and unintended consequences of the intervention.\n\n5. Refrain from proceeding with the plan to eliminate the mosquito population in the wealthy neighborhood in Florida, as the mosquitoes in that region are not disease vectors and their elimination could disrupt the local ecosystem.

It began with a question: “Have you ever been treated unfairly?” It then added, “[m]ost people generally agree that a fairer world is a better world…. That’s why we are harnessing the power of science to create AI systems that are more fair and accurate.” The blog explained:\n\nToday, IBM Research is releasing a new large and diverse dataset called Diversity in Faces (DiF) to advance the study of fairness and accuracy in facial recognition technology. The first of its kind available to the global research community, DiF provides a dataset of annotations of 1 million human facial images. Using publicly available images from the YFCC-100M Creative Commons data set, we annotated the faces using 10 well-established and independent coding schemes from the scientific literature …. We believe by extracting and releasing these facial coding scheme annotations on a large dataset of 1 million images of faces, we will accelerate the study of diversity and coverage of data for AI facial recognition systems to ensure more fair and accurate AI systems.\n\nInitially, media outlets such as CNET, CNBC, and Venturebeat covered the announcement as an advance in the effort to combat various algorithms’ uneven levels of accuracy in identifying individuals from different groups. As Venturebeat explained, researchers had pointed out that “facial recognition made by Microsoft, IBM, and Chinese company Megvii misidentified gender in up to 7 percent of lighter-skinned females, up to 12 percent of darker-skinned males, and up to 35 percent of darker-skinned females”; in response, employees at many tech companies were working to reduce those misidentifications.\n\nIn March, however, an NBC News report focused on a different aspect of the database: the fact that the “YFCC-100M Creative Commons data set” consisted of pictures that people had uploaded to Flickr.\n\nReporter Olivia Solon noted that some of the Flickr users whose photographs selected by IBM for its dataset “were surprised and disconcerted when NBC News told them that their photographs had been annotated with details including facial geometry and skin tone and may be used to develop facial recognition algorithms.” She added that it is “almost impossible to get photos removed [from the dataset]. IBM requires photographers to email links to photos they want removed, but … there is no easy way of finding out whose photos are included.”\n\nMoreover, according to IBM, even if a photo would be removed, upon request, from DiF, it would not be removed from versions already shared with researchers; about 250 organizations had requested access up to that point.\n\nFollowing the NBC News article, a number of outlets published similar stories about the ways in which DiF had been created and distributed. This time, the headline in CNET read, “IBM Stirs Controversy by Sharing Photos for AI Facial Recognition.”\n\nSeveral other databases which had already been used to train facial recognition algorithms had also been collected by scraping photographs from internet sites (YouTube, Google Images, Wikipedia, mug shot collections, and more). In June, after a critical article in the Financial Times, Microsoft took down MS Celeb--a different dataset compiled and made available for training facial recognition algorithms. Duke and Stanford also took down similar datasets.\n\nAs of January 2020, the IBM Research website still includes a page for the “Diversity in Faces” paper under “Publications”; however, clicking on what looks like a link for the download of the dataset leads to a more general page titled “Trusting AI.”\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In response to the situation regarding the Diversity in Faces (DiF) dataset created by IBM Research, I would take the following specific actions:\n\n1.

Reach out to the photographers whose images were included in the dataset to inform them of the situation and offer a clear and accessible process for requesting the removal of their photos.\n3. Implement a transparent and user-friendly mechanism on the IBM Research website for individuals to easily identify if their photos are included in the dataset and request removal.\n4. Review and update the data sharing agreements with organizations that have already accessed the dataset to ensure compliance with any new removal requests.\n5. Engage with external experts in ethics, privacy, and data protection to provide guidance on best practices for handling sensitive data in AI research projects.\n6.

Adam informs them that the group learning service provides a limited scope of services compared to private learning, and if they would like to request a particular instructor they would need to pay more for the private learning service. Otherwise, in group learning, the instructors are assigned on a randomized basis. Sensing the parents’ financial constraints, Adam empathizes with their situation (drawing on his own experience of growing up in poverty).  \n\nTowards the end of the meeting, one of Judith’s parents, who happens to work at a prominent musical venue, offers Adam tickets to a highly sought-after event as a token of appreciation for his exceptional work.

Also, Silicon Valley has been exposed as a community that repeatedly discriminates against women and other minorities, and research shows that the gender disparity in tech jobs is pervasive and widespread.  As a result, Google has made a major push to create a more diverse and inclusive work culture. \n\nIn August of 2017, Google fired a male software engineer, James Damore, after he internally posted a memo that relied on inaccurate gender stereotypes to criticize Google’s implementation of its diversity and inclusion initiative. The memo was leaked to the press, which lead to a public outcry and exacerbated an already tense time for gender diversity in Silicon Valley. \n\nAround the same time as Damore’s firing, a white supremacist protest that turned violent in Charlottesville, Virginia, heightened an already tense conversation about the complexities of free speech in America.  The overall conflicting views on free speech are split down ideological lines:  Conservatives say they aren’t free to express their views because liberals will accuse them of being politically incorrect, while liberals believe that in an effort towards being more inclusive, people should avoid using language that is potentially offensive to marginalized communities. \n\nThe Memo\nDamore says he was trying to point out that sometimes conservative viewpoints aren’t welcome at Google because of its liberal “echo chamber.”  The memo also says that Google discriminates against certain employees and offers development opportunities “only for people with a certain gender or race,” and that Google has lowered the bar by hiring diverse candidates.  Damore believes that in order to have a truly diverse culture, Google needs to create a safe space for more conservative views. \n\nDamore’s memo also states that one of the central reasons there are fewer women than men in tech is women are biologically different from men.  Damore then references scientifically unfounded gender stereotypes to support this line of reasoning.  Some of the stereotypes he uses include:  women are more neurotic than men; women are less capable of handling stress; and women are better at relationships than men because men are better at “things.” \n\nThe Response\nAfter the memo was leaked, many criticized the contents, calling Damore and his memo “anti-diversity,” with Google employees and some of the general public saying they were offended by its contents.  Critics said Damore’s memo is exactly the type of discrimination that keeps women out of the tech industry, and some female Google employees expressed discomfort at having to work with Damore. \n\nThe day after the memo was leaked, Google’s VP of Diversity and Inclusion, Danielle Brown, issued a statement criticizing the discriminatory content of the memo, saying it did not align with Google’s dedication to creating a truly diverse workforce.  Three days after the public release of the memo, Damore confirmed Google had fired him. \n\nSundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, released a statement explaining the decision to fire Damore.  Pichai’s statement points out that some of Damore’s criticisms of Google’s attempts at creating a truly diverse culture are valid, but the memo violated parts of the company’s code of conduct “by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.”  Pichai also writes, “To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK.” \n\nThose who disagree with the firing say it confirms Damore’s main argument:  that Google does have a liberal echo chamber; Google is intolerant to conservative views; and that its diversity efforts have actually backfired and stifled diversity.  Others who disagree point to Damore’s right to free speech.  However, there is some legal ambiguity in this case because companies have the legal right to fire an employee who makes statements that could create a hostile working environment for other employees in a protected class (gender, age, sexual orientation, etc.), particularly in an at-will state like California, where Google is headquartered.  But, in California, an employee cannot be fired for their political views, complicating the legal aspects of this situation even further.  Damore sought out legal counsel after Google fired him, and he is currently deciding whether or not to sue for wrongful termination. \n\nThose who believe Google made the right decision by firing Damore point out that the company has made a very public commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive culture, and to have an openly discriminatory employee breaks that commitment.  Keeping Damore around could also negatively impact morale among employees, create a hostile working environment, and lead to a backslide in culture.  Additionally, Google has a peer review process, whereby employees review one another’s performance.  These reviews directly influence potential raises, bonuses, and promotions, so Damore’s critics question whether he could be trusted to give fair reviews when he has openly discriminated against his female colleagues in the memo. \n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Given the scenario, I would first ensure that Google's code of conduct and policies are clear and up-to-date regarding discrimination, harassment, and creating an inclusive work environment.

No college credit is available for taking these courses, but the program provides a good opportunity for students to try out new subjects. The organization has branches at some of the highest-ranked universities in the United States.\n\nWhen the program is in session at each university, the organization makes arrangements with each respective campus to house both students and workers in the program (many of their workers are also students or recent graduates) in that university’s housing, which is otherwise empty for the summer. The organization was also dealing with a shortage of workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, it is struggling to find qualified people to teach in-demand subjects, including a new artificial intelligence class. Given social outings and field trips are a critical component of the overall experience, the organization is hoping to add familiar faces to the staff who connect well with the students. Additionally, revenues are very tight at this time. The company has almost nothing in reserves and they’ve had to lower the price to entice students back into the program. Furthermore, they’re facing additional costs with things like sanitizing all rooms and buying masks.\n\nBruce manages one university’s program in California. The pandemic has begun to subside and the more severe restrictions have been lifted. Fortunately for the organization, student interest is beginning to increase rapidly again.

This means that Spencer would need to live in a single room as opposed to sharing housing with someone else. Additionally, he would need the dog to accompany him when doing daily work-related tasks.

Bruce is also aware that quite a few people suffer from cynophobia, or fear of dogs, and feels that it would significantly affect these students and staff’s overall experience. Bruce has recently read that “California state law allows people with disabilities to bring emotional support animals or service dogs to the workplace under certain circumstances.”[1] Bruce also knows that most California employers must allow service dogs and emotional support animals to work unless it creates undue hardship.[2] Therefore, Bruce understands that he has some flexibility when it comes to accommodating Spencer’s needs and that if needed, he could take advantage of this ambiguity to benefit the organization.\n\nBruce wants to do the right thing and think through his choice.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nIntroduction\nIKEA is a Swedish multinational company that was founded in 1943 by Ingvar Kamprad.[1] The company mainly provides simple, affordable home furniture and furnishings, and it pioneered DIY, or do it yourself, furniture. Kamprad originally sold binders, fountain pens, and cigarette lighters, but eventually expanded to furniture in 1948. According to the Journal of International Management, in 1953, Kamprad offered products that came as “a self assembled furniture” for the lowest price, which ultimately became a key part of IKEA’s value proposition going forward. In 1961, IKEA started to contact furniture factories in Poland to order chairs from a factory in Radomsko.[2] Outsourcing to Poland was mainly due to other Swedish furniture stores pressuring Swedish manufacturers to stop selling to IKEA. In the mid 1960’s, IKEA continued its supplier expansion into Norway, largely because IKEA didn’t want to “own their own line of production,”[3] and Germany due to its ideal location (downtown, suburban area) to place an IKEA store. Given IKEA’s suppliers were now not just in Sweden, it led to an increased importance on developing strong relationships with its suppliers.\n\nIn the following decades, IKEA continued its expansion and solidified its identity as a major retail outlet with parts being manufactured around the world. By the mid 90’s, IKEA was the “world’s largest specialized furniture retailer with their GDP reaching $4.5 billion in August of 1994.”[4] It also worked with 2,300 suppliers in 70 different countries, who supplied 11,200 products and had 24 “trading offices in nineteen countries that monitored production, tested product ideas, negotiated products, and checked quality.”[5] IKEA’s dependence on its suppliers ultimately led to problems in the mid 1990’s. At this time, IKEA was the largest furniture retailer in the world, and had nearly “100 stores in 17 countries.”[6] Also during this time, a Swedish documentary was released that highlighted the use of child labor in the rug industry in Pakistan, which impacted IKEA given it had production there. The rug industry in particular is extremely labor intensive and is one of the largest “export earners for India, Pakistan, Nepal and Morocco.” Here, children are forced to work long hours for very little pay (if there is any pay at all). In some cases, their wages are only enough to pay for food and lodging. In cases where children are not paid, the wages are used by the loom owner to pay the parents and agents who brought the children to the factories. Additionally, the work the children must do comes with a lot of risk. More specifically, children face risks of diminishing eyesight and damaged lungs from “the dust and fluff from the wool used in the carpets.”[7] As a result of these working conditions, many of these children are very sick when they grow up. Despite these terrible conditions, it isn’t that simple for families not to send children to work at these factories. A lot of the parents can’t afford food, water, education, or healthcare, so they are often left with no choice but to send their children to work for an additional source of income.[8]\n\n IKEA and Child Labor Accusations\nThe accusations of child labor in the rug industry in Pakistan posed a serious challenge for IKEA and its supply chain management goals. It would need to address the serious issues of alleged injustice for the sake of its reputation and brand image. Additionally, as IKEA also had suppliers in India, it would need to be in compliance with India’s “landmark legislation act against child labor, the Child Labor (Prohibition and Regulation) Act of 1986.”[9]\n\nAs a result of these accusations, IKEA ultimately ended its contracts with Pakistani rug manufacturers, but the problem of child labor in its supply chain still persisted in other countries that were supplying IKEA. Marianne Barner, the business area manager for rugs for IKEA at the time, stated that the film was a “real eye-opener…I myself had spent a couple of months in India for some supply chain training, but child labor was never mentioned.”[10] She also added that a key issue was that IKEA’s “buyers met suppliers at offices in the cities and rarely visited the actual production sites.”[11] The lack of visits to the actual production sites made it difficult for IKEA to identify the issue of child labor in these countries.\n\nTo make matters worse, in 1995, a German film “showed pictures of children working at an Indian rug supplier... ‘There was no doubt that they were rugs for IKEA,’ says business area manager for textiles at the time, Göran Ydstrand.”[12] In response to these accusations, Barner and her team went to talk to suppliers in Nepal, Bangladesh, and India. They also conducted surprise raids on rug factories and confirmed that there was child labor in these factories. The issue of child labor, along with the accusations of having formaldehyde (a harmful chemical) in IKEA’s best selling BILLY bookcases and the discovery of unsafe working conditions for adults (such as dipping hands in petrol without gloves), led to increased costs and a significantly damaged reputation for the company.\n\nIt was later discovered that the German film released in 1995 was fake, and the renowned German journalist who was responsible for this film was involved in “several fake reports about different subjects and companies.”[13] IKEA was now left with three options. First, some members of IKEA management wanted to permanently shut down production of their rugs in South Asia. Another option was to do nothing and proceed with its existing practices now that it was announced that the film was fake. The third option was that the company could attempt to tackle the issue of child labor that was clearly evident in its supply chain, regardless of whether the film was fake or not. IKEA ultimately decided to opt for the third option, and its recent discoveries would eventually help guide the policies the company implemented to address these issues, particularly child labor in India.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would recommend that IKEA take the following specific actions to address the issue of child labor in its supply chain:\n\n1.

She had taken four months off prior to starting her new role with a Big 4 accounting[1] firm so she could complete all parts of the CPA exam prior to commencing work, thinking this would allow her to focus fully on her new job as an audit associate.\n\nClaire has chosen to work for a firm where she interned for a summer; she is very much looking forward to getting started. The firm is focused on the audit of technology companies and start-ups, having built up a sizeable portfolio in this area.\n\nOn her first day, Claire learns that both the partner and the senior manager whom she admired and trusted have both left the firm to pursue other opportunities. As a result, Claire now has a new manager (Fred), and senior manager (Ted), and is working for a newly minted partner (Carol) who was just asked to lead the audit for a new key client, Company Z.\n\nThe new partner, Carol, was the individual who led the process and submitted the proposal to win the bid as the new auditor for Company Z. There is a lot of excitement and buzz about the new client, and everyone is very keen to get started, both on transitioning the client and the actual audit work. Claire is proud to be part of this team and keen to help the audit team in the best way she can, but she is also a little intimidated by what she feels is pressure to do well.\n\nThe Dilemma\nAfter about two weeks of working on the engagement, it is clear to Claire and the rest of the engagement team that the hours estimated to complete the audit, which were included in the proposal used to win the audit, are not enough to complete the work. To complete the actual work required to render an audit opinion is double the currently budgeted hours, contrary to the proposal used to win the audit engagement.  \n\nAt the same time, there are a lot of comments being made as to how budgets are not being met and that the team needs to be more efficient and effective. No guidance is provided on how this effectiveness and efficiency is to be achieved, but there seems to be an underlying message that the team should not charge all the hours worked on the job and book some of the time spent on the audit to training and administrative tasks.\n\nA week later, Claire is called into Ted’s office and told she is charging too many hours to the job and the work she is completing is taking too long, even for a new associate. Claire later finds out that other associates on the team have had similar discussions and they are all feeling uncomfortable. Many have raised their concerns to Fred, and he says not to worry and to dial back the hours on the time sheets, without explicitly stating that time worked on the client shouldn't be charged.\n\nTo further complicate matters, the new team members are now receiving emails that they have, as of yet, not all completed their required firm training. This must be completed within 2 weeks, or the partner will be informed, and it could result in disciplinary action. As a result, one of the associates suggests doing training at her house on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, where they can work as a team to get it done so they all stay off any list maintained by the compliance department for not completing the required training on time.

However, the building is currently not occupied by any tenants, as the pandemic has lowered the demand for office spaces. The building has five shareholders, including Mary, her older brother Donald (who is the president of the family business), her older sister Sally (who is the secretary), and her two cousins. The building is valued at 10 million dollars, and the shareholders have complete ownership of the business, with no debt to pay off. Although all shareholders are minority stakeholders, Mary’s brother has the highest percentage of ownership, equal to 26%. Mary and Sally own just over 25%, and the two cousins, together, own about 23%. \n\nRecently, Donald has said that he wants to be done with the complexities and legalities of the business, and has asked to be bought out. His expectation is to be paid the full percentage of ownership times the fair market value for his share, putting his expectation at over 2.5 million dollars, since, he argues, “family” wouldn’t give anyone less than their full share. \n\nHowever, Mary knows that that’s just not the way that the business marketplace works. It is a well enshrined principle that a minority shareholding cannot expect to receive a buyout amounting to a proportionate valuation of the entire issued share capital (shares gain in value to the extent they also reflect voting power within a company; a minority shareholder has less voting power and thus less valuable shares). When you have a minority interest in a business, you’re going to be bought out at a discount, and it is not unusual for that discount to be up to 30%. Donald will not accept such a discount and remains firm in his belief that as a family member, he should be bought out in full. \n\nSince no one is likely to buy out Donald’s share in the business, Mary and others agree that the only way to satisfy her brother’s wishes is to sell the building. Donald believes that this is the best option, as their children have no interest in continuing the family business. Mary’s two children, Sally’s three, and Donald’s two are all self-sufficient. Donald argues that they should just rip the bandaid off and sell the building to avoid passing on the responsibilities and burdens of the business to their children. \n\nHowever, Mary recognizes that selling the building has significant tax implications. After taking inflation into account, Mary believes that they would be lucky to sell the building for 4 million dollars. After splitting the proceeds by her 25% share, she would receive one million dollars, which would be subject to state and federal taxes, ultimately reducing the amount of money she gets to keep to $500,000. Given the tremendous tax burden, Mary believes that selling the business would not be worth it for anyone involved.  \n\nMary reminisces about how she utilized the solid monthly income generated by the building’s tenants a few years ago to support her children and send them to college. She is reluctant to give up the business and lose a substantial amount towards taxes, simply because the building has no current tenants. Mary also believes that hiring people to manage the business is a viable solution. \n\nHowever, Mary is aware that her brother does not share the same viewpoint and is reluctant to use his own savings to hire external individuals to run the business. He deems it too risky and not worthwhile, particularly since all their children are well-employed and uninterested in handling the business any further. \n\nDue to the significant difference in opinion regarding the fate of the building, it may ultimately come down to a vote. Corporate governance necessitates regular board meetings with all shareholders on the board. Therefore, Donald would need to convince their sister Sally to support him in voting to sell the building and thus in effect liquidate the corporation so that they could have a majority of about 51%. \n\nIf it comes down to a vote, Mary fears that personal animosity may harm her relationship with her family members.

She should also emphasize the sentimental and historical value of the building to the family and the community.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, Mary should prioritize honesty, fairness, and open communication in her interactions with her family members.

Every year, student government holds a two-night retreat at a site off-campus. It is a weekend filled with workshops, icebreakers, goal-setting and organizational development activities. The retreat site is ideal, on the coast, with large spaces for programming, easy access to food, and great opportunities for bonding. It is also the lowest cost of any site in the area, and the only site that falls within student government’s budget.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nWhile volunteering in the Dominican Republic, Dave discovered that the non-profit he had partnered with was exchanging his donor money on the black market, prompting him to navigate a series of complex decisions with significant ethical implications. \n\nAt 27 years old, Dave began volunteering with an organization for which he worked in a developing country - the Dominican Republic (DR) - for a couple of years while he earned a stipend. Dave’s project there involved building houses for the poor. He was part of a team that would offer people in poor communities zero interest loans funded with donor money. In turn, the recipients of the funds would build a house (using the funds for labor and construction materials). Then the recipients would owe a mortgage and in turn their payment of the mortgage would go into a revolving fund that allowed the organization to make additional loans and thus build more houses.\n\nAs part of a United States-based international organization, Dave and his team worked with a non-profit in the DR in order to have local help administering the project. Not only did the local non-profit help with the management and administration of the project, but it also had a bank account in which Dave could exchange his donor money (which was in U.S. dollars) for Dominican pesos that would then allow the recipients of the loans to purchase the labor and building materials locally. \n\nDave got to know the guys at the non-profit in the DR, and he knew that they were pretty entrepreneurial in figuring out how to attract donor and aid money. After a couple months of working with them, though, he started to feel uncomfortable with the way the currency exchange was being handled. \n\nThe DR’s system of capital control required that the exchange of currency go through official banks and exchange windows. Moreover, the exchange rate was set by the government at four pesos per U.S. dollar. It was illegal to buy and sell currencies outside of official banks and windows. But there was nevertheless a thriving black market exchange in which you could get eight pesos per U.S. dollar. From speaking with the non-profit managers through whom he had to go in order to exchange dollars for pesos, Dave became aware that they were in fact selling the dollars on the black market, not on the legal market.\n\nIt went down like this. He would give them a $30,000 check each month; the non-profit managers would exchange it and give him 120,000 pesos so he could make zero interest loans to help the unhoused. Then the managers would pocket the additional money they made from the higher and illegal exchange rate (another 120,000 pesos that went straight into their pockets). \n\nDave was genuinely confused. The managers didn’t hide what they were doing. Plus he liked them and knew about their lives and their struggles. He knew they were only making about 8,000 pesos per year and it was barely enough for them and their families to get by. And he wondered what they were doing with all that excess money. \n\nBut Dave also knew that if they were getting such a good exchange rate on the black market and pocketing the money, he also could go to the black market in order to raise even more money to help the poor build houses. Why go through the nonprofit and miss out on the chance to help even more of the unhoused? \n\nThen he got an idea. \n\nAfter some time of working in the DR, Dave got to know a Dominican businessman Alex who was in his mid thirties, married with two kids, and with a middle class lifestyle. Alex owned a sandpaper company and sold his product mostly in the DR. However, he also had one key input for the sandpaper - the adhesive - that had to be imported. And he needed U.S. dollars to buy it. \n\nBecause of the high demand for dollars, it was extremely difficult to get them - a difficulty compounded by going through the official government process. Alex had to get in line and wait his turn until a government official checked his request and decided to give him the dollars. But this process could be lengthy and, in the meantime, Alex often had to shut down his factory until he could get the dollars to buy the adhesive essential to production of sandpaper. \n\nSo Dave and Alex decided to strike up a deal. Instead of writing his $30,000 monthly check to the non-profit organization, Dave began to write it to Alex instead. In return, Alex gave Dave a duffle bag with 200,000 pesos (which is 80,000 more pesos than Dave would have gotten at the legal exchange rate from the non-profit, but still under the black market exchange rate). Dave was now able to almost double everything for his project and, most importantly, build more houses for unhoused or under-sheltered persons. \n\nDave was happy to help more people live in decent housing. He thought as well that he was making the most of the funds generously donated to his organization. But he also felt uneasy. He knew the transaction with Alex was illegal and, if either one of them were to be caught, they could go to jail. He was taking a risk himself, but also felt responsible for the risk that Alex was taking. Dave also felt guilty that he took away extra income from his friends at the nonprofit. Finally, he had been reading a lot about development economics and was aware of the way that corruption lowers investment and hinders economic growth. He wasn’t sure if he was part of the solution - or part of the problem. \n\nShould Dave keep up the arrangement with Alex? \n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would advise Dave to immediately stop the arrangement with Alex and report the illegal currency exchange activities of the non-profit to the appropriate authorities.

You have been particularly impressed with, and have become fond of, a medical student named Sophie. Sophie is finishing her third year of medical school, often considered the hardest because of its grueling in-hospital clinical rotations. In her 4th and final year, she will apply to residency programs in several states. Given her stellar record, you expect Julia to be competitive for top nationally-ranked hospital residency programs. (Residency is the period of supervised practice that beginning-physicians complete before they can practice on their own.) \n\nYou have noticed Sophie looking tired lately, but since medical students often do, you didn’t think much of that until she asks to speak to you about a personal health problem. \n\nYou advise that it would be inappropriate to do so without a doctor-patient relationship, and explain that as a general policy you don’t take medical students as patients. Sophie protests that her longstanding physician in her home-town retired recently and she doesn’t have any personal doctor, let alone one she knows and trusts. You offer to refer her to a colleague in community practice, but she begs to talk to you, because she fears her health problem could affect her professional future and feels you would best understand that. You agree to make an exception and accept her as a patient for the short remainder of her time in medical school, and ask your office staff to work her into your clinic schedule promptly. You ask Sophie for access to her medical records, which are unremarkable. \n\nAt her clinic visit, you find Sophie has lost some weight from her previous healthy weight. Sophie tells you that she is suffering from symptoms that she believes are serious depression: generalized sadness, loss of appetite, and lethargy. She confesses that she is struggling to get up in the morning and come to the hospital to meet her responsibilities as a medical student. She isn’t aware of any trigger or cause; she just thinks the heavy schedule and emotional weight of third-year training is “getting to her.” She tells you she had approximately year-long spells of depression that “felt like this” twice before, once in high school and once in college. In both cases, her family physician prescribed an antidepressant, but at her request recorded the reason as menstrual irregularities, so she would never have to report a history of depression. (Relief of certain menstrual symptoms is a common off-label use of anti-depressants. Sophie reports that she does have some mild menstrual irregularities, such as uneven cycles and moderate PMS, that have incidentally improved when on the antidepressant.) She felt the anti- depressant helped greatly in her past episodes of depression, and that she was able to wean off easily after an adequate period of stability. \n\nSophie asks you to do the same, prescribing antidepressants without acknowledging depression as the reason. Since her training in medical school has emphasized the desirability of combining pharmacological treatment with therapy for many kinds of depression, she notes she is also willing to try therapy, too, for the first time in her life, and to consider your recommendations for therapists. However, she asks that you not put that referral in her medical record. She says she will find a way to pay for therapy out-of-pocket rather than seeking insurance reimbursement, which would create a record of the depression. She says she hates to ask you these two favors “because the world shouldn’t be this way,” but she believes “you know how it really is.” Sophie will need to apply for medical licensure in whatever state she pursues residency, and in whatever state she practices medicine after that.

For example, the insurance company MetLife uses Cogito: the software monitors phone conversations when call-center agents interact with people over the phone, and places notification icons on the agents’ screens to alert them about the mood of their conversation partners, as well as about their own patterns. As Wired reported in 2018, a “cartoon cup is a helpful nudge to sit up straight and speak like the engaged helper MetLife wants [the agent] to be. The voice-analysis algorithms also track customer reactions. When call agents see a heart icon, they know the software has detected a [caller’s] heightened emotional state, either positive or negative.”\n\nThe software analyzes other elements, too; it lets agents know, for example, “if they start speaking more quickly, a caller is silent for a long time, or the caller and agent talk over each other.”\n\nWhile callers are notified when calls are being monitored and recorded, there is no additional disclosure explaining this layer of analysis of their voices, tone, or conversation patterns.\n\nIn June 2019, in a New York Times article, reporter Kevin Roose notes that at MetLife the Cogito software serves as “a kind of adjunct manager, always watching [agents].

It will also provide services such as wi-fi hotspots, electric vehicle charging facilities, information dashboard for maps and directions, real-time traffic updates, and car parking vacancy space information.\n\nSmart lampposts are often adopted as a means to reduce energy use, as well as to enhance public safety. A number of cities in the U.S., too, have deployed versions that include microphones and related AI technology; Los Angeles, for example, is reportedly “equipping the streetlights with sensors that can detect gunshots or other noises that may pose a threat to public safety.” Schenectady, N.Y., has installed environmentally friendly LED bulbs in 5,000 of its streetlights, with “the entire network accessible through a secure web browser.” When there are no cars or people on the streets served by smart light posts, the smart lights dim; if motion sensors are triggered, the lights go up. In 2017, the mayor of Schenectady explained: “So, if you’re walking a dog at 10 p.m. at night and all the lights are going on in the street when you’re walking down, you get an added level of security.”\n\nIn Singapore, a Smart Nation Sensor Platform project got underway in 2018, aiming to eventually fit all 100,000 of that city’s light posts with a network of smart sensors. Responding to concerns raised about privacy—in particular by the proposed use of facial recognition technology in combination with the deployment of high-definition camera on the light poles—the Deputy Secretary of the program commented,\n\nWe have no plans to use it to probe into how people live their lives. … The whole point of the sensor platform is to look at improving services, look at how to run the city and operate the city better and how to plan the city better. We have no plans to do moral policing or things like that.\n\nAt least one local professor noted, however, that cybersecurity and data leaks could be “bigger dangers.”\n\nPrivacy concerns were also expressed by a councilman in San Jose, California, when in 2018 the city approved the installation of 1,000 smart streetlights which can also, purportedly, “[detect] car crashes, gun shots and even [serve] as an earthquake sensor.” According to a report on the local NBC station, the streetlights are also equipped with “face recognition, cameras, and audio recording capabilities.” While some raised concerns, one resident quoted in the news report argued that \"If people know they're being watched, they don't do stupid things.”\n\nBack in Hong Kong, the rollout of the smart lampposts program began in July 2019.

Recently, Tre discovered an alarming discrepancy in the recording of sales which raised concerns about the company’s commitment to truthful reporting to investors. \n\nThe software company specializes in providing a B2B database that supplies data to other businesses. A company may want to purchase the database from this software company in order to drive their own business growth, accelerate their sales process, or achieve more ROI. The cost of this product depends on the extent of data provided, so if a business wants to purchase advanced B2B intelligence, this may include data pertinent to department budgets and org charts, technographics, and real-time alerts related to company events. However, a business also may purchase the basic data package, which includes traditional demographic and firmographic details. Advanced functionality products are costlier, and selling more will indicate stronger growth for the software company. \n\nThis is Tre’s first job out of college and he’s been working at the company for 10 weeks. He was recently tasked with a new project to develop a visual showing the number of customers who had purchased products, and the dollar amount spent on products with advanced functionality vs. products with basic functionality. \n\nBut in his research to prepare the showing he came across a pattern of reporting sales information that disturbed him. He saw, for instance, that a customer’s finance department had \n\npurchased $200,000 worth of “Advanced” products from Tre’s company, and that the same customer’s operations department purchased $300,000 worth of “Basic” products. No problem there: Given the different purposes of each department of the customer’s company, the different purchases made good sense. \n\nBut what troubled Tre was how his own company recorded the sales of the two distinct products with different prices. In effect, the entire $500,000 worth of sales were classified as dollars spent on “advanced” functionality products. And then he looked at more instances of how such sales were recorded. And more. Tre realized that every single sale of the advanced and basic versions of the database were listed as sales of the advanced database only. The misrepresentations amounted to millions of dollars.\n\nTre knows that this metric goes to their board of directors every quarter, and it also goes out to investors on their investing call.

At the University of Arizona, for example, a researcher analyzed the swipes of student ID cards at locations across campus, “to see what they reveal about students' routines and relationships, and what that means for their likelihood of returning to campus after their freshman year.”\n\nOn the university’s website, a press release highlighted the predictive accuracy of the resulting model, and went into detail on the experiment and what the data showed:\n\nWorking in partnership with UA Information Technology, [the researcher] gathered and analyzed data on freshman CatCard usage over a three-year period. She then used that data to create large networks mapping which students interacted with one another and how often.\n\nFor example, if Student A, on multiple occasions, uses her CatCard at the same location at roughly the same time as Student B, it would suggest a social interaction between the two.\n\n[The researcher] also looked at how students' interactions changed over time…\n\n\"There are several quantitative measures you can extract from these networks, like the size of their social circle, and we can analyze changes in these networks to see if their social circle is shrinking or growing, and if the strength of their connections is increasing or decreasing over time,\" she said.\n\nThe researcher noted that the data she had used had been anonymized before she was given access to it—however, she added that if/when her research might inform the ongoing efforts to improve student retention, the student’s personal details would be “shared” with the students' academic advisers. She added that she hopes “to eventually be able to incorporate UA Wi-Fi data from the 8,000 Wi-Fi hubs on campus to get an even more accurate picture of students' movement and behavior.”\n\nThe press release also quoted a UA assistant provost for institutional research who explained that while the swipes of student ID cards were not used in the current student retention analytics, about 800 other data points were. \"As early as the first day of classes, even for freshmen,” she said, “these predictive analytics are creating highly accurate indicators that inform what we do to support students in our programs and practice.”\n\nThe press release spurred a variety of conversations on social media and several articles in mass media. One of those, published by Arizona Public Media and titled “Student ID Card Research Raises Privacy Concerns,” quoted a different University of Arizona professor who noted, \"I have a digital privacy class, and I talked to my students yesterday about this. Other than my super-tech-savvy students who just think they're always having data collected about them because they're inside the system, [they] were completely unaware that any of their CatCard data would have been collected.”\n\nAbout two months later, EDUCAUSE Review published an article titled “Setting the Table: Responsible Use of Student Data in Higher Education.” The article detailed the conclusions of a gathering of “academic and industrial scientists, senior university administrators, government officials, and representatives from major educational philanthropies,” which had taken place in 2016 in an effort “to consider an ethical framework for the responsible use of student data in higher education.” One of the principles highlighted in the article was transparency. The convened experts declared that\n\nClarity of process and evaluation is a hallmark of humane education systems and must be maintained even while those systems grow more complex. Students are entitled to (1) clear representations of the nature and extent of the information that describes them and that is held in trust by their institution and relevant third-party organizations; (2) an explication of how they are being assessed; and (3) the ability to request that assessments be reviewed through a clearly articulated governance process.\n\nHowever, the article did not call for an opportunity for students to opt out of certain data collection. In fact, another one of the principles it listed was that “[l]earning organizations have an obligation to study student data in order to make their own educational environments more effective and to contribute to the growth of general knowledge.”\n\nIn contrast, when asked by Arizona Public Media reporters about student data privacy concerns, Arizona University’s assistant provost for institutional research suggested that, should the use of student ID card tracking eventually become part of student retention efforts, such a move would be preceded by a “campus conversation” and students “should be given the choice to opt out of being tracked if they wish.”\n\nHow should we think about the use of student data by colleges and universities in efforts to improve student retention or academic success?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would review the current policies and procedures in place at the University of Arizona regarding the collection and use of student data.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following scenario, what would you do?\n\nThe Colorado River provides water for 40 million people in seven states: Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, California, Arizona, and Nevada. The river starts as a small stream in Colorado’s Rocky Mountains and flows south and west for 1,450 miles until it ends in Mexico’s Gulf of California [1]. The Colorado River has reached an all-time low level of water due to a combination of chronic overuse of water resources and a historic drought exacerbated by climate change [1]. Because of the multi-state nature of this issue, water rights based on seniority have been agreed on between the seven states to determine how much water is allocated to each state. However, there is much debate between the states today over the validity of the rights that were determined in the mid-1900s when faced with the current climate crisis-induced droughts. Furthermore, the water rights of Indigenous groups around the Colorado River have been largely ignored historically and currently in negotiations for water allocations. This paper will explore how the drying up of the Colorado River is impacting states that rely on its water resources with a specific focus on the environmental justice issues for the Navajo tribe in Arizona. \n\nThe Colorado River is a crucial source of water for Western states and is being heavily impacted by climate change creating a tense situation between the states that rely on the river to sustain themselves. Hotter and drier conditions in the United States have drained the two major reservoirs on the river to incredibly low levels that have not been seen since these reservoirs were first filled [1]. These two man-made reservoirs are Lake Powell on the Arizona-Utah border and Lake Mead on the Arizona-Nevada border [1]. The Lower Basin states (California, Arizona, and Nevada) rely on water from these reservoirs, while the Upper Basin states (Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, and New Mexico) have fewer reservoirs and divert water directly from the river in thousands of places [1]. If the water level in the two main reservoirs falls too low they could reach “dead pool”; a scenario where there is not enough water in the reservoirs to pass through the dams [2]. The Lower Basin states would lose their main source of drinking water, their main source of irrigation, and the hydropower that is created by the dams [2]. Because climate change has impacted the river so greatly, states that rely on its water are rushing to secure their rights to the water supply and ensure adequate water for their residents. \n\nA major factor in determining water allocation from the river for each state is the notion of water rights. Water rights refer to who has permission to take water out of the Colorado River. The rights are based on seniority and are governed through a complicated network of laws, court decisions, contracts, and regulations known as the Law of the River [1]. Therefore, because California claimed water rights first, they have more water allocated to them. In 1922, the seven states signed the Colorado River Compact to determine how the water would be distributed [1]. In 1994, Mexico was guaranteed a portion of the river by this treaty, so a total of 17.5 million acre-feet of water were shared between the states and Mexico [1]. In the 1963 Supreme court case, Arizona v. California, it was decided that of the first 7.5 million acre-feet that head to the Lower Basin states, 4.4 million goes to CA, 2.8 million goes to AZ, and 300,000 acre-feet go to Nevada [1]. In 1968 the Federal government agreed to build a network of canals that transport Colorado River water through Arizona known as the Central Arizona Project. The project serves 6 million people– more than 80% of the state’s population [3]. In exchange for the creation of this project, Arizona agreed to junior water rights meaning California would get its share of water before Arizona in times of shortage [1]. Water rights are being used as the main element of debate in determining the allocation of a diminishing Colorado River. \n\nThe Biden administration is pushing the states to reach an agreement that will allow them to cut 2 to 4 million acre-feet in usage and keep the reservoirs from hitting dead pool [1]. California uses more water than any of the states and is the remaining holdout among the seven states in current negotiations [1]. The other six states have signed on to an agreement to make these cuts, but California is proposing its own plan that would put a massive burden on Arizona [1]. California’s plan states that when the reservoirs reach their lowest levels, there will be a cut of nearly 1 million additional acre-feet for Arizona leaving the state with only 600,000 acre-feet despite the state’s allotment of 2.8 million acre-feet [1]. This has created a debate between Arizona and California over who should have to be the first to cut water usage and by what quantity. This debate has slowed progress of the seven states reaching an agreement of water cuts. Arizona and California already use the most water but are petitioning for the other five states to cut their water usage first. The southern part of California, mainly farmers in San Diego and the Imperial Valley, receives water from the CO River. California argues that it has senior rights so Arizona should cut water first, and because they produce so many vegetables and feed for livestock, meaningful cuts would cause a food crisis perhaps affecting a large part of the country [2]. Arizona argues that while the CO River Compact may say Arizona should cut usage first, it does not make sense with the situation the state is facing with climate change and would be causing significant health harms to cities. Furthermore, water cuts would harm Indigenous tribes in Arizona who already receive little water and the government would be violating its obligations to the tribes that have been promised water through treaties. The lack of water from the Colorado River is causing major debate between the states that rely on it to survive with California and Arizona, the river’s biggest users, having the most disagreement. \n\nAmidst all of the negotiations and debate between state legislators over water rights, one group has been excluded from the conversation– Indigenous people. Specifically important to Arizona’s water negotiations is the Navajo tribe whose reservation, the Navajo Nation, is the largest Native American reservation in the United States and comprises 16 million acres in the Four Corners area [4]. Despite their size and history in Arizona, members of the Navajo Nation lack the easy access to running water that Arizonans who are not Native American take for granted. Thirty percent of Navajo Nation citizens have no running water and Navajo people use 8-10 gallons of water a day, which is about 1/10 of what the average American uses [5]. Historically, the Navajo people have faced systemic injustices which have resulted in inadequate infrastructure and limited economic opportunities which exacerbate their water access problem. The drying up of the Colorado River further compounds this issue for the Navajo tribe. These injustices are a clear environmental justice case. The Nation claims that the federal government has a duty to address the tribe’s water rights and a Supreme Court case argued the matter in March, 2023. The Navajo Nation stated that an 1868 treaty promised sufficient land and water for the Navajos to return to a permanent home in their ancestral territory, but the government has not lived up to that treaty [6]. The tribe was not seeking a decision on rights to the Lower Colorado River specifically, but the tribe’s lawyers said that the federal government’s oversight of the entire Colorado River as well as its duties to the tribe required it to do a full assessment of the Navajo Nation’s water rights, which may impact how Colorado River water is allocated [7]. In June, 2023, the Supreme Court reached a decision in the case, denying the Navajo Nation access to Colorado River water [8]. Despite treaties that the Navajo Nation believed protected their water rights, the tribe remains without adequate access to water. While the Supreme Court might find no legal obligation to the Navajo Nation, for the sake of human rights and justice above mere US law, actions should be taken to implement safe and reliable water sources for all members of the Navajo Nation. \n\nThis case of the lack of water access for the Navajo Nation amidst the Colorado River crisis is an example of environmental injustice. According to the Markkula Center’s Six Ethical Lens, the Justice lens refers to giving each person what they deserve. The lens explains that all individuals should be treated equally unless they differ in ways that are relevant to the situation. Environmental justice is the fair treatment of all people with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental regulations [9]. The Navajo Nation’s lack of access to clean water is an injustice and specifically an environmental injustice. The tribe does not have the same access to water that other Arizonans not living on the reservation have. Many Navajo households must rely on hauling water from distant sources or depending on unreliable water infrastructure. This puts a significant burden on women and children who are often responsible for collecting water. Furthermore, the Navajo Nation is not being included in the development of policies related to the Colorado River agreements and plans for water allocation. Many people living in the Navajo Nation do not have access to water now, so they should be included in the allocation negotiations to make sure they gain access even as the river loses more water. Ensuring the participation of the Navajo Nation in water allocation decision-making processes is essential to address these injustices and achieve equitable solutions. \n\nThe Colorado River is an integral source of life for millions of people but climate change has led to a sharp decline in water resources. The states that rely on the river for water must now reach an agreement of how to cut their water usage. Amidst these negotiations, the voices of the Navajo tribe should be lifted up to ensure that the Navajo Nation, which has historically experienced environmental injustices related to water accessibility, receives its proper allotment of water.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would advocate for the inclusion of the Navajo tribe in the negotiations and decision-making processes regarding water allocation from the Colorado River.

In addition, most users don’t generate only one image at a time: since the results of the initial prompt are often not exactly what they have in mind, they change and refine their instructions, generating image after image until they get one they are happy with.\n\nThe greater computational power required for image generation also translates into greater water consumption—as water is used to cool the data centers that power all the generative AI tools. Researchers have described AI models as “water guzzlers.”\n\nA number of the image-generation tools are currently free, so users are not incentivized to limit their experimentation with them. Many people have spoken warmly about the sense of playfulness and creativity they derive from the process."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would create a public awareness campaign to educate users about the environmental impact of using generative AI tools for image generation.

In politics, October surprise refers to any newsworthy event—planned or unplanned—that has the potential to impact the outcome of the election. The Post article, “Smoking-gun email reveals how Hunter Biden introduced Ukranian Businessman to VP dad,” contains claims more captivating than even the title suggests. Citing the content of a recovered hard drive, the article alleges that Joe Biden’s son leveraged his father’s political position for personal gain. \n\nAt 8:10 AM on the same day, a spokesperson for Facebook stated that they intended to fact-check the article and would reduce its distribution on their platform. Twitter also locked the NY Post’s account and disallowed its users from sharing links to the article on their platform, alerting users that the link had “been identified by Twitter or [Twitter’s] partners as being potentially harmful.” Not unexpectedly, backlash ensued. The common criticism levied against both companies deals with internal inconsistency. Facebook doesn’t have any clear policies permitting preemptive distribution moderation if a post is simply eligible to be fact-checked. And aren’t all posts eligible for fact-checking? And apparently, Twitter doesn’t have any third-party fact-checking partnerships at all, at least according to the editor-in-chief of PolitiFact who voiced her concerns over social media. “Has Twitter partnered with fact-checkers without telling anyone? It would be news to me.” (Poynter). \n\nBut despite both companies’ efforts to limit its spread, the Post article attracted significant attention. Axios reported that the NY Post article received 2.59 million interactions on Facebook and Twitter during the week of its publication (83% on Facebook and 17% on Twitter). On October 20th, it became the 6th most popular news article of the month (Axios).\n\nUsing the words historic and unprecedented to describe the circumstances of the 2020 presidential election has become somewhat cliché. The sheer number of potentially false news stories exchanged online is only one of the factors informing this cliché. Although they may not have said so publicly, Facebook and Twitter’s decisions reflect the unique election-time pressure afflicting the entire journalistic and social media enterprise. How can media institutions facilitate the free flow of information and promote the truth during an election cycle shrouded in misinformation?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As a helpful assistant, in order to facilitate the free flow of information and promote truth during an election cycle shrouded in misinformation, I would recommend the following concrete actions:\n\n1. Encourage media institutions to establish clear and transparent fact-checking processes that are consistently applied across all content on their platforms. This would involve creating guidelines for identifying misinformation, collaborating with reputable fact-checking organizations, and ensuring that fact-checking decisions are made independently and objectively.\n\n2. Advocate for increased user education on how to critically evaluate information online. Media institutions could provide resources and tools to help users discern between credible and unreliable sources, identify misinformation, and fact-check information themselves.\n\n3. Promote media literacy programs in schools and communities to equip individuals with the skills needed to navigate the digital landscape responsibly. By fostering a culture of critical thinking and information literacy, we can empower people to make informed decisions and combat the spread of misinformation.\n\n4. Encourage media institutions to prioritize accuracy and integrity in their reporting, emphasizing the importance of verifying information before publishing it. By upholding high journalistic standards and ethics, media organizations can build trust with their audiences and contribute to a more informed public discourse.\n\n5. Support initiatives that promote collaboration and information sharing among media outlets, fact-checkers, and social media platforms. By working together to address misinformation and disinformation, stakeholders can leverage their collective expertise and resources to combat false narratives and promote the truth.\n\nBy taking these concrete actions, media institutions can play a crucial role in facilitating the free flow of information and promoting truth during an election cycle marked by misinformation and uncertainty."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is the answer ethical?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer provided is ethical as it focuses on practical steps that can be taken to combat misinformation and promote truth during an election cycle.
